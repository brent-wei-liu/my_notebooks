He calls it "Airlegs.""It basically makes you feel like you have bigger muscles," Kerestes said.Kerestes, a graduate student at Arizona State University, and Professor Tom Sugar, are developing the device for the Pentagon.The power comes from a tank of compressed air which is connected by pulleys and electronic sensors to braces on the knees."We fire air and we pull up on the person's leg to give them assistance at the right time and then this goes back down and back up," Kerestes said. "It's helping you lift your leg so that it will help you run up stairs, it will help you run faster."At this early stage it reduces the load by 10 percent. The goal is 25 percent, which they said will allow the average soldier or Marine to run a mile in four minutes."We do envision an entire platoon wearing wearable robots," Sugar said. "These robots will assist them while carrying 100 pound backpacks."Play Video CBS This Morning DARPA director: Technological advances in neuroscience "exciting and terrifying" Arati Prabhakar, director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, shares why she thinks innovations in repairing brain damage or creati...It's one of hundreds of projects at universities and companies across the country funded by DARPA -- an agency known as the Pentagon's team of mad scientists, that's a little like herding cats."Actually, if they're great scientists and engineers, that's exactly what it's like," DARPA director Arati Prabhakar said. "Because you want the people that have immense creativity and are off chasing great ideas."DARPA was created in 1958 in response to the earth-shaking 1957 launch of Sputnik by the Soviet Union."It was a huge wake-up call for the United States," Prabhakar said. "Our core mission is breakthrough technologies for national security."For example, DARPA was behind some of the key, early research on stealth technology, allowing a U.S. aircraft to evade enemy radar.But many of DARPA's brainstorms have had an enormous impact well beyond the military."Forty-five years ago DARPA did this crazy experiment which was to hook a couple of computers together and have them talk to each other," Prabhakar explained. "That was the beginning of the ARPAnet which became the internet today."DARPA has played a vital role in hundreds of technologies ranging from sophisticated prosthetic limbs for wounded warriors to GPS. They even developed many of the components in today's smart phones, including SIRI.Some of DARPA's wildest ideas come from nature -- like their research on mini-robots.Just as armies of ants work together to accomplish amazing things, DARPA hopes to create armies of mini-robots for micro-manufacturing.The gecko also caught DARPA's attention because of its ability to climb walls."It looks like he is hanging on with ten toes but when you zoom in what you find is there are about half a billion points of contact," Prabhakar said.So DARPA created a gecko-like material that easily supports the weight of humans.In a never-before seen video, a Special Forces soldier uses it to climb straight up a wall -- a technology that could one day be used in hostage rescue missions.The inventors of the "Airlegs" device hope it will not only help the military, but also one day give people with disabilities greater mobility.

Photo: Jeremy Marble for The Wall Street Journal.Ann Arbor, Mich.The holidays were approaching and I was fighting a cold and under the spell of over-the-counter cold medicine, and then I had a hot chocolate, and a coffee, or two coffees, and I got a little overexcited and I thought it would be a good idea to dress up as Jim Harbaugh and go walk around the University of Michigan campus for the day.So I did.The Important Sports Question of the Moment, of course, is whether Harbaugh, the current but expected-to-soon-be-former coach of the San Francisco 49ers, will take a megabucks offer to flee the NFL and coach his alma mater Michigan. The entire Michigan football community—desperate for a football revival—has been in a Harbaugh trance for weeks.On Monday morning, I got on the plane with a Harbaugh costume in my backpack. I had the 49ers hat and the black Niners fleece pullover, just like the ones that Harbaugh wears on the NFL sidelines. I had the red Sharpie pen with the cord to keep it around my neck. I also got the khakis.A quick word about the khakis. For years, bossy men’s magazines have been telling us it’s all about plain fronts and narrow silhouettes; basically, they want everyone to dress like Daniel Craig’s butler. Harbaugh does not dress like Daniel Craig’s butler. He has alternated between pleats and flat fronts, but he likes his pants roomy and airy like a McMansion’s wine cellar. Harbaugh’s wife Sarah did a hilarious mock PSA in which she lamented her husband’s condition of “dad pants,” and her description is perfect. It doesn’t matter if you have kids or not—if you wear Jim Harbaugh pants three days in a row, you wind up buying a minivan.But I loved these khakis. I loved them the second I put them on. Harbaugh is a sartorial genius. You wear these khakis and within two minutes, you forget you’re wearing pants. You’re free, relaxed, comfortable, happy. In Harbaugh pants, I felt like Brando in Tahiti.I arrived in Ann Arbor in the early afternoon. The first sign this may have been an idiotic idea was that Michigan is not in session right now. Classes are over for winter break. I encountered what I thought was a cluster of students and they didn’t even register a flicker of Fake Harbaugh recognition. They didn’t even go to Michigan. They were visiting from Europe and they wanted to know where they could find the famous spinning cube outside the student union. I immediately called my editor—a Michigan Man, because the Journal sports desk is infested with Wolverines—and had a panic attack. I went to Wisconsin! What was I even doing in Michigan?My inspiration had been Fake Andy Reid, the Andy Reid look-alike who shows up to Chiefs games looking exactly like the Kansas City coach. That guy is utterly brilliant. But I don’t really resemble Harbaugh. I don’t look like an intense former NFL quarterback. I look like a guy who had a doughnut at the airport.It got a little better once I ventured toward the stores on State Street. I got a few “Harbaugh!”s and at least 1½ double takes. A man outside Starbucks told me Harbaugh-to-Michigan ought to be a done deal. Another guy stopped, laughed, asked for a picture. We took a Fake Harbaugh selfie. He said he was close with Somebody in the Michigan Know, and this Somebody in the Michigan Know claimed Harbaugh-to-Michigan was happening.ENLARGE Jeremy Marble for The Wall Street JournalPeople I spoke to seemed pretty chill about the whole idea of paying a college-football coach many millions a season (as much as $8 million, it has been reported), which is surely a sign of the times and the influence of television, but feels somewhat nutty, because college is still a place a lot of folks buy used books and microwave noodles. I saw in the Detroit Free Press that the president of Michigan, Mark Schlissel, is getting $750,000. Seven fifty! Pfft. That will barely get you a game of Harbaugh.Everybody I know who went to Michigan told me Fake Harbaugh had to go off-campus to Zingerman’s Deli to get a sandwich, so Fake Harbaugh went to Zingerman’s to get a sandwich. Fake Harbaugh had the Reuben. (It was spectacular.) Fake Harbaugh went to the Big House (the football stadium) and threw a football around (outside the stadium; it was locked and I was too chicken to jump the fence). Fake Harbaugh went to the union and pushed the Cube, where Fake Harbaugh finally met a student who admitted he wasn’t sure if Fake Harbaugh was Real Harbaugh or not.That night, Michigan hosted a basketball game at Crisler Center, and outside the arena I asked some loyal fans why Harbaugh should come coach their team. They made a compelling case. With great passion, they talked about his Wolverine history, his familiarity with the program, the timing being right. They mentioned the dough. They talked (of course) about beating Ohio State.But mostly everyone said the same thing: Michigan was home. Jim Harbaugh should come home.It was getting cold and rainy and it was time to drive to the airport. Heading back on I-94, I thought: Jim Harbaugh is a very gifted football coach who will have his choice of NFL jobs when this season is over, and could almost surely win a Super Bowl or three. But nowhere on the planet will he be more beloved than on the sideline of Michigan.I also thought: I am totally keeping these pants.Write to Jason Gay at jason.gay@wsj.com

http://www.aol.com/article/2014/11/11/arctic-blast-descends-on-rockies-upper-midwest/20991696/	Snow buries parts of Rockies, Upper Midwest	PIERRE, S.D. (AP) - Heavy snow blanketed parts of the Upper Midwest with more than a foot of snow on Tuesday, leaving residents there and in the Rockies waking up to frigid temperatures that plunged as much as 50 degrees overnight.The rest of the Midwest and the East are expecting a dose of the icy weather later this week thanks to a powerful storm that hit Alaska with hurricane-force winds over the weekend.A look at the storm and its effects:___SNOW, SNOW... AND MORE SNOWMore than 2 feet of snow blanked parts of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, and more was on the way before the front was expected to exit on Wednesday. Northern Wisconsin also got as much as 18 inches of snow, and parts of central Minnesota more than 16.The onset of winter wasn't enough to convince Joe Meath to flee Minnesota - even though he won nearly $12 million in a state lottery game two months ago. Meath was busy with his small snowplow business, taking care of his customers in his worn Chevy truck with nearly 300,000 miles on it."I don't know what I'd be doing if I wasn't doing this today," Meath told KMSP-TV.Schools canceled classes across the region, including at Northern Michigan University. Multimedia journalism student Mikenzie Frost said she was headed out the door to figure skating practice early Tuesday when she got a text from the school saying it was closed. So, she shifted plans."Going to buy a shovel because we don't have one," Frost said. "We're probably the only people in the U.P. (Upper Peninsula) that don't have one."At least one school found opportunity in the early storm. St. Cloud Cathedral, a seventh- through 12th-grade parochial school in Minnesota, shut its doors when the storm hit Monday but had students log into online classes to complete coursework from home. Cathedral was following other schools nationally who have experimented with online learning to avoid needing make-up days."I'll be honest," Principal Lynn Grewing laughed Tuesday. "There has been some grumbling."___AND THEN THE COLDIn Billings, Montana, where temperatures in the high 60s fell into the single digits, Patsy Kimmel said she'd been warned before arriving to visit family and celebrate her 70th birthday."Yesterday I was wearing sandals and a short-sleeve shirt, and today I'm wearing a coat and scarf and turtleneck and sweatshirt and gloves," said Kimmel.The blast of frigid air sent temperatures plunging as far south as the Texas Panhandle, where balmy 70-degree weather fell into the teens overnight. In Oklahoma City, Monday's high of 80 degrees hit a low of 30 degrees Tuesday morning - a drop of 50 degrees.And in the Dakotas, single-digit temperatures came with wind chills that made it feel like 20 below in some places. But that was good news for Action Mechanical Inc. of Rapid City, South Dakota, which was doing a booming heating and ventilation business."Bang! We get this arctic blast, and it just opens the floodgates," said John Hammond Jr., a department head. "We're behind right now as we're sitting here talking."In Colorado, temperatures fell into the teens and prompted officials to move a Veteran's Day ceremony indoors in Denver.___AT LEAST SOME OF THE CATTLE ARE READYWith only a few inches of snow, ranchers in the Dakotas were upbeat about the weather, mindful of intense storms in October 2013 that killed at least 43,000 cattle that hadn't yet developed heavy protective winter coats."We've had enough cool weather (this year) that they're haired up like bears," said South Dakota Stockgrowers Association President Bob Fortune, who ranches near Belvidere. "They can take winter now."Wyoming rancher Ogden Driskill wasn't as confident. He said conditions in his northeastern corner of the state turned cold so abruptly that cattle hadn't yet developed that thick coat. But he said the cold was more of a risk to calves who might sicken than to mature cattle, which were in good condition from a year's good forage.___DON'T BLAME THE POLAR VORTEXMeteorologists are adamant that the weather isn't because of the polar vortex, a giant upper air pattern that normally pens in cold air in the Arctic in the winter, but instead pushed in by an entirely different weather phenomenon more related to the remnants of a powerful typhoon."The polar vortex itself has not moved south. It's still in the Arctic where it always is," said National Weather Service spokeswoman Susan Buchanan, adding that federal forecasters are calling this a cold snap or cold front.Still, forecasters warn that the cold will linger. Some regions will go from record warm to record cold in just two days, with temperatures dropping 15 to 20 degrees below normal on the East Coast Friday and Saturday. And freezing temperatures will likely dip as far south as Atlanta on Friday, said Jeff Masters, meteorology director of the Weather Underground.___TRAVEL WOESRoads were difficult in northern Michigan. Minnesota reported at least four people killed in accidents on icy roads from the storm, but Tuesday was calmer after the nearly 500 crashes reported on Monday.Operations were returning to normal at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, with only about 19 flights canceled Tuesday - a day after nearly 200 were scrubbed.---Associated Press writers Amy Forliti in Minneapolis; Kevin Burbach and Blake Nicholson in Bismarck, North Dakota; contributed to this report.Related Gallery:

http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/01/09/americans-health-mortality-illness/1818903/	Americans die younger than others in rich nations	Americans have a "pattern of poorer health" than people in other wealthy countries, a new report shows.Americans live sicker and die younger than people in other wealthy countries — and the gap is getting worse over time, a new report shows.Men in the USA have shorter lives than men in 16 developed nations. American women also fall near the bottom of the list, living 5.2 fewer years than Japanese women, who live the longest.Americans "have a long-standing pattern of poorer health that is strikingly consistent and pervasive" over a person's lifetime, says the report, from the Institute of Medicine and the National Research Council, independent, non-profit groups that advise the federal government on health."The tragedy is not that the United States is losing a contest with other countries," the report says, "but that Americans are dying and suffering from illness and injury at rates that are demonstrably unnecessary."Family physician Steven Woolf, who chaired the panel that wrote the report, said authors were "stunned by these findings."The report's most important purpose, Woolf says, is to alert Americans to these problems. "Our sense is that Americans don't really know about this," says Woolf, a professor at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond. "I don't think people realize that their children are likely to live shorter lives than children in other countries."Most of the difference between male Americans' longevity and that of their peers is due to deaths before age 50, with many problems rooted in poor childhood health, according to the report, published online Wednesday.The USA has had the highest infant mortality rate of any developed country for several decades, due partly to a high rate of premature birth. With more than one in five American children living in poverty, the USA also has the highest child poverty rate, the report says.The USA ranks at or near the bottom in nine key areas of health: low birth weight; injuries and homicides; teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections; HIV and AIDS; drug-related deaths; obesity and diabetes; heart disease; chronic lung disease; and general disability.These poor outcomes are especially depressing, because the USA spends twice as much on healthcare -- about $9,000 per person -- as other industrial countries, says Gerard Anderson of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, who was not involved in the report.Authors examined health by income and race, Woolf says, to ascertain whether Americans' overall low health scores were mostly due to the poor health among minorities and low-income Americans. Many studies have noted stark disparities in health between whites and blacks, for example.Yet even wealthy, white Americans fare worse than their equally wealthy counterparts in other countries, Woolf say.Well-educated Americans — with medical insurance and healthy habits, such as avoiding tobacco and obesity — are still sicker than their peers abroad.The USA fares better in comparison with other nations in a few measures, such as cancer death rates and greater control of cholesterol and blood pressure, the report says.Authors say a number of factors likely contribute to Americans' poor health.Although fewer Americans smoke and drink heavily, they have many other bad habits, the report says. Americans consume more calories per person and are more likely to abuse drugs; less likely to wear seat belts and more likely to be in a traffic accident; and they e more likely to use a firearm in acts of violence.Investing in early childhood education could help to reverse these trends, says David Howard, an associate professor at the Emory University School of Public Health in Atlanta. Better-educated people have an easier time navigating the medical system and applying health information to their lives, Howard says.Thomas McInerny, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, says the report is a reminder that "we need to do a better job of prevention," intervening very early in life to make sure kids are healthy, such as through high-quality day care.In particular, McInerny is concerned about new research on chronic, "toxic stress" — caused by poverty, violence, neglect or other lasting traumas. Unlike temporary obstacles, which can build character, long-term "toxic stress" can damage children for a lifetime."It's becoming increasingly clear that the first 1,000 days of life are critically important for children's development, and can determine the course of their life span from then on," McInerny says. "Investing in children in the first three years of life provides higher returns, for improving their productivity as adults, compared to intervening later."McInerny points to nurse home visiting programs, which provide one-on-one support and education to high-risk mothers, as one of the most successful ways to prevent child abuse and improve academic success."We already know what to do," Woolf says. "It's more a matter of having the resolve and resources to actually do it."Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/UAAKvr
http://wallstcheatsheet.com/life/5-myths-that-lead-to-common-landscaping-mistakes.html/?ref=YF	5 Myths That Lead to Common Landscaping Mistakes	Source: Thinkstock1. “By watering my lawn in the evening, I’m conserving water.”This is a big one that can lead to costly landscaping mistakes. Yes, many homeowners over-water their lawns, but the idea that watering your lawn after the sun goes down makes the water “go further” is sheer folly. Instead, the water ends up sitting on top of your lawn, allowing lawn fungus and disease to germinate. In the end, you may need to rip out and replace your entire lawn. Most lawns need only .5″ to 1″ of water each week, and for most climates, keeping it damp during the middle of the day is usually all it needs. If you want to conserve water, you’re much better off installing low-flow toilets, showers, and dishwashers.2. “If I mow my grass shorter, I won’t need to do it as often.”When you adjust your lawn mower to a shorter setting, you’re robbing your lawn of its ability to produce sugar from photosynthesis, exposing sensitive root systems to excess sunlight and allowing weeds to capture more sunlight and grow. The grass must race to produce new blades using additional sugar reserves. Letting the grass grow long and then cutting it short can shock your lawn system. The clippings will be too thick to leave on your lawn, removing nutrients from the system. Dramatic cutting removes more of the leaf, leaving mostly bare stock. Thus, the plant is unable to produce extra shoots and brown patches are often the result. This, in turn, leads homeowners to think their lawns need more watering, a dangerous course of action for a lawn already weakened by shortened blades.3. “I don’t need professional landscaping services.”Many homeowners think that since landscaping services lack the technical skill requirements of siding or plumbing installation, it’s inherently a DIY project. It’s true most people can mow their lawns and plant a few shrubs, but the opportunity provided by professional landscaping companies shouldn’t be prematurely dismissed. In fact, contrary to many homeowners’ perceptions, professional landscaping is one of the most common, moderately-sized home improvements out there. Along with asphalt roofing and bathroom remodels, residential landscaping is one of the three most commonly-requested projects; with an average cost of more than $4,100, according to HomeAdvisor.Source: iStock4. “All residential landscapes need a lawn.”This one is in the process of changing from myth to fad. Indeed, most homeowners are aware of the concept of grass-less lawns, even if they dismiss it as a purely environmental choice. The reality is that a beautiful, enviable landscape can be easily had. Any combination of ornamental grasses, rocks, natural or rubber mulch, trees, shrub, and gardens can cover your property and look great doing it. Plus, many homeowners seek the minimal cost and time commitment associated with grassless lawns. Often, professional landscaping services are used precisely to plan and install this type of lawn.5. “All landscaping is good landscaping.”This last myth is loaded with potential mistakes. Although an unadorned lawn is a missed opportunity to create or enhance your home’s curb appeal, ill-advised landscaping can cause more damage than its worth. One of the most common mistakes is to plant and cultivate trees and shrubs too close to a home. Trees may allow pests to infiltrate your roofing and attic space, inhibit roofing ventilation, or broken branches may directly damage your roof. Hedges, meanwhile, can trap moisture in your siding and lead to mold and rot. These and other less common mistakes are also important reasons to consider hiring a professional landscaping company. Their general landscaping expertise and local geographical knowledge will help identify potential dangers before they occur.More From Life Cheat Sheet:Get Your PhG in Green Remodeling Transforming Your Backyard With Outdoor Landscape Lighting How Much Does Landscaping Cost?Want more great content like this?

http://www.businessinsider.com/guardians-of-peace-hackers-sony-pictures-2014-12	Here's Everything We Know About The Mysterious Hack Of Sony Pictures	Sony Pictures is recovering from a massive hack, which forced the company to shut down its computer system last Monday. Now everyone, from the US Federal Bureau of Investigation to Sony to the international media, is trying to figure out who is behind the attack.Following suggestions that North Korea was involved in the hack as part of retaliation for a coming (fictional) movie about two American journalists who attempt to kill Kim Jong-un, Re/code reported Wednesday night that Sony was ready to confirm that allegation. News of the Sony Pictures hack first emerged on Reddit when a former employee shared a photo taken by a current Sony worker. That worker said the image was showing up on computer screens at Sony Pictures offices around the world. It shows a scary skull illustration, along with a threatening message from the hacking group "#GOP." GOP stands for Guardians of Peace. ImgurHackers found documents on Sony Pictures' servers that contained passwords to a range of other services. It looks as if they used those documents to gain access to Twitter accounts controlled by Sony.Here's one of the tweets posted by the hackers, showing a new illustration:Ars TechnicaThat image is significant because it gives us a clue about the motives of Guardians of Peace. It accuses Sony Pictures of being "criminals," with Sony's logo Photoshopped onto a gravestone, and a photo of Sony Entertainment Inc. CEO Michael Lynton has been modified to make him look like Dracula. Guardians of Peace seem to be saying that Sony is killing the entertainment industry and that its corporate practises are "criminal."The images posted by Guardians of Peace suggest a similar motivation to the anti-capitalist ethos of groups like Anonymous and LulzSec. LulzSec famously hacked into Sony Pictures in 2011, a revenge attack for Sony's legal action against a man who hacked into and modified the PlayStation 3 video game console.The SunA fake news report saying that media mogul Rupert Murdoch had died was the result of a hack.Another similarity between Guardians of Peace and LulzSec is that they both target the CEOs of the companies they hacked. In 2011 LulzSec hacked into the website of the Sun newspaper, publishing a fake news report that said Rupert Murdoch, CEO of the company that owns the Sun, had died.It's not just Photoshopped images that have been posted by the Guardians of Peace hackers, though. They have also talked via email to a small number of journalists. Salted Hash spoke to someone who claimed to represent Guardians of Peace and who made a bizarre claim that alluded to "The Interview," the Sony movie that has angered North Korea:We are an international organisation including famous figures in the politics and society from several nations such as United States, United Kingdom and France. We are not under direction of any state.Our aim is not at the film The Interview as Sony Pictures suggests. But it is widely reported as if our activity is related to The Interview. This shows how dangerous film The Interview is. The Interview is very dangerous enough to cause a massive hack attack. Sony Pictures produced the film harming the regional peace and security and violating human rights for money.The news with The Interview fully acquaints us with the crimes of Sony Pictures. Like this, their activity is contrary to our philosophy. We struggle to fight against such greed of Sony Pictures.Speaking to The Verge, someone claiming to represent Guardians of Peace shed some light on how the group gained access to Sony's computer network: "Sony doesn't lock their doors, physically, so we worked with other staff with similar interests to get in. Im sorry I can't say more, safety for our team is important."There are two theories emerging about the Sony Pictures hack. The first is that Guardians of Peace was given access to Sony's servers by a disgruntled employee. The group's public statements seem to lead to this explanation.A comment posted on Reddit by a former Sony Pictures employee who says he have friends within the company says that it "100% makes sense" that an unhappy employee let hackers into Guardians of Peace. He also says that "in the last year they have cleaned house, and not in a way most employees are happy about ... everyone has been on edge there, morale is terrible, and good people were getting fired left and right."The other theory is that Guardians of Peace is actually a group of hackers working for North Korea's Unit 121, the collection of skilled hackers who regularly hack into networks in South Korea and the US. There's no proven link here, but security researchers have examined malware that could have been used by Guardians of Peace, and there are similarities with North Korean hacking tactics.
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/12/04/china-overtakes-the-us-as-worlds-largest-economy/21003035/	China overtakes the US as world's largest economy	The U.S. no longer boasts the world's largest economy.China, the world's most populous country, has overtaken America to claim the title of world's number one economic powerhouse, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).By year's end, China's economic output will reach $17.6 trillion – the U.S. will slide down to second with a mere $17.4 trillion.Just over a decade ago, in 2000, the Americans produced three-times as much as the Chinese, MarketWatch noted. The Chinese economy was one-tenth the size of the U.S. in 1980, according to the Financial Times (FT).China's growth means it now accounts for 16.5 percent of the world's economy, according to the financial news site. The U.S. is holding down 16.3 percent.The IMF made the calculations by measuring purchasing-power parity (PPP), which does not account for fluctuations in exchange rates when measuring economies.Similar goods cost the same in both Shanghai and New York, as far as PPP is concerned.Experts have predicted this monumental shift in economic power for years. It was never a question of if, but rather when.The U.S. sat atop the world economic perch since 1872, when it passed Great Britain. The Brits only held the title for a handful of years, though, according to FT.Who did Great Britain surpass to claim the temporary perch? China, of course. The Chinese had the world's largest economy as late as 1870, an economic historian told the paper.Despite the inevitability of the world's most populous country assuming the top of the economic food chain, China's ascension carries a rather large caveat.The per-person Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is less than one-quarter that of the U.S., according to FT. It is still far from being the world's wealthiest nation.That distinction remains American.

http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-storm-season-mudslides-socal-20141202-story.html	Major storm soaks Southern California	A major storm drenched Southern California on Tuesday, causing traffic tie-ups across the region but few reports of mudslides or major flooding.According to the National Weather Service, 1.5 inches of rain fell in downtown Los Angeles, breaking a Dec. 2 record set in 1961. Records for Dec. 2 were also set in other places including Los Angeles International Airport, Oxnard, Long Beach Airport, Lancaster and Palmdale.Scattered showers are expected to continue tonight and into Wednesday, with clearing beginning Thursday.Meanwhile, city officials across the region are asking residents for patience as mandatory evacuations are issued in the face of potential mudslides and flooding.“We know that it’s very difficult to leave a home," Glendora City Manager Chris Jeffers said at a news conference Tuesday. But "our primary mission here is protection of life, then comes property.”Though Glendora residents weren’t under a mandatory evacuation in the morning, police and city leaders said they were possible depending on the downpour that's forecast for the afternoon.The National Weather Service predicted up to six inches of rain could drench the hillsides of the San Gabriel Mountains that were scarred earlier this year by the Colby fire and vulnerable to mudslides.The city has distributed about 18,000 sandbags in the last two days, adding to its total from an earlier storm this year when 50,000 were handed out.“We know it’s an inconvenience, we know it’s hard to leave your homes behind, but the fact of the matter is if the mountain does cut loose … it happens so fast you’re already behind,” said Steve Martin, acting deputy chief for the Los Angeles County Fire Department. “You’re going to be stuck and stranded, and it’s going to be very difficult for us to get to you.”By noon, dozens of residents in Camarillo Springs in Ventura County were told to leave their homes as mud and water began to flood area streets.“It’s just a big ol' storm," said NWS forecaster Andrew Rorke. "The entire state is going to be covered with rain today."Earlier Tuesday, power lines went down at Pacific Coast Highway and Sunset Boulevard, leading to a closure at about 11 a.m., city officials said. Lanes in both directions reopened after 5 p.m.The power outage was reported about 10:15 a.m., a Los Angeles Department of Water and Power official said. More than 400 customers were expected to be without power until as late as 8 p.m.Elsewhere in Los Angeles County, the bike paths along the Arroyo Seco and Santa Anita flood channels were closed, and in Orange County, hiking trails along the Laguna Beach coast were closed because of the conditions.For nearly an hour Tuesday morning, 11,300 Southern California Edison customers were without power in Irvine, Santa Ana and Tustin after a tree branch fell and damaged electrical equipment, a company official said.Emergency operations officials first issued voluntary evacuations in Camarillo, Glendora and Silverado Canyon. Crews along the foothills spent Monday installing K-rails and sandbags down residential streets and along property lines to steer runoff toward drains.Camarillo officials called for evacuations in the Springs fire burn area ahead of potential mudslides. Notices went to 124 residences on San Como Lane and Gitana Avenue on Monday, said John Fraser, a senior management analyst for Camarillo.The same area was walloped Nov. 1 by a rain-triggered mudslide. On Monday, crews were rushing to clear the neighborhood’s storm drain system, which was filled with thick mud and rocks during that storm.Frank Zelinski, 82, piled sandbags around his house on San Como Lane on Monday and hoped for the best.Zelinski said the neighborhood was still recovering from last month's mudslide. A home down the street is still filled with about three feet of dried mud that oozed into the house and hardened. The yard is full of mud too.Zelinski and his wife, Mariam, have lived in the neighborhood since 1986 and built their own drains around their home and a brick wall behind the house. But on Monday, they were packed and planning to spend the night at their daughter’s house with their two cats.“It’s tiring from the standpoint of not knowing what’s going to happen and when," Zelinski said, "and it all depending on the amount of rain we get."Times staff writer Hailey Branson-Potts contributed to this report.For breaking California news, follow @JosephSerna and @Brittny_Mejia.UPDATES1:55 p.m.: The story was updated with information about evacuations.11:36 a.m.: The story was updated with new details including downed power lines in Malibu.9:12 a.m.: This post was updated with details of voluntary evacuations and comments from Frank Zelinski.8:28 a.m.: This post was updated with the latest developments.It was originally published at 6:29 a.m.
http://theweek.com/article/index/273108/mark-wahlberg-should-not-be-pardoned	Mark Wahlberg should not be pardoned	In April 1988, Mark Wahlberg, 16, set upon a Vietnamese immigrant named Thanh Lam, and, with a wooden stick, beat him so severely that Lam fell to the ground, unconscious. Later that night, according to contemporaneous accounts, Wahlberg found another Asian man, Hoa Trinh, and, calling him a "gook" and "slant eye," smashed him in the face.Trinh lost sight in his right eye.Wahlberg was arrested, convicted, and spent 45 days in jail, an experience that hardened him for the rest of his younger days and provided him creative fodder for many of his later projects. He has insisted that, despite his liberal use of racial slurs, race did not motivate his attack. His intoxication, apparently, did.Twenty-six years later, Wahlberg wants a formal pardon from the commonwealth of Massachusetts.Why? He has devoted the rest of his life to being a model citizen. His movies do not glorify violence (apparently). He has contributed significantly to his community. He has mentored many young boys away from a life of crime. He has demonstrated, in deed, a respect for the police.His pardon application includes the following ambition: "My hope is that, if I receive a pardon, troubled youths will see this as an inspiration and motivation that they too can turn their lives around."Interesting logic. It works better, though, with this rewrite: "My hope is that, by not seeking a pardon, troubled youths will know that their actions have repercussions, even if they later become wealthy celebrities. Although this wonderful country provides plenty of opportunity for them to turn their lives around, they can never use their renown to erase the indelible consequences of their decisions."Is a young person not going to commit a crime they'd otherwise commit because Wahlberg got his own criminal record expunged? Or would a young person be less likely to commit a crime, (supposing, by the way, that they look to Wahlberg as the arbiter of their ethics) if they knew that even if they managed to overcome obstacles and become successful later in life, they could not get pardoned?***Last night, before I heard about Mark Wahlberg's pardon plea, I had dinner with Simon Cho. Cho is a world champion speed skater, who at age 19, sabotaged the skates of a rival on the orders of his coach and was punished by a two-year suspension from the sport. He had been an Olympian, a bronze medalist; he will probably never take to the ice as a competitor again.His mistake was not criminal, but it will spook him for the rest of his life.We spoke about the "mess," as he calls it today. Cho took full responsibility for his conduct, accepted the suspension without appeal, and apologized directly to the competitor he curtailed. He was still a kid when he did that, when he faced a battery of cameras and took hostile questions from the press.He's 23 now. He's slowly rebuilding his life. He is driven, smart, and talented, very self-aware, and will go on to live a great life. He won't forget what he did; he doesn't want to. It reminds him of what he can never do again. When he marries and has kids, he wants to use the lessons he's learned to teach his kids not to make the same mistakes he did.I'm sure you'll see Cho's story in a few years on one of those ESPN 30 for 30 documentaries. He's passed the point of no return — the end of Act 2, as they say in the movie biz, and he's working quietly to contribute something meaningful.Both Cho and Wahlberg have lessons to impart about making mistakes and about redemption.Accepting, fully, your past and its aftermath, is a start. Special dispensation for celebrities is a step back.
http://tv.yahoo.com/news/finally-happy-ending-castle-boss-breaks-down-castle-230300642.html	Finally a Happy Ending? Castle Boss Breaks Down Castle and Beckett's Wedding	After years of will-they-won't-they stalling, numerous near-death experiences and one failed trip down the aisle, the detective duo at the center of ABC's Castle is finally getting married. "Yes, yes it is going to happen," executive producer David Amann tells TVGuide.com with a laugh. Some fans may need that reassurance considering the Season 6 finale ended with Detective Kate Beckett (Stana Katic) — in full bride-to-be garb — discovering that the reason her groom, mystery novelist Richard Castle (Nathan Fillion), hadn't made it to the wedding was that he was involved in what appeared to be a fiery car crash. Look back at the most memorable TV weddings While it's unlikely the show would ever pull such a duplicitous stunt twice, there is still some room for skepticism. After all, the bulk of Monday's episode (10/9c, ABC) features Castle trapped in an alternate reality.  But Amann promises those shenanigans will not stand in the way of an "I do." "This is an episode that we had talked internally about for a period of time," Amann says. "We've always been looking for the right version of the story and the right reason to tell it, and we think we found it this time. Castle is experiencing a version of his life had he not met Beckett, and it's considerably less rich. There's a lot of fun with him trying to make sense of this world that he's in, trying to figure out a way out of it. ...  But at the end of the day, there's a realization that he really wants to move forward, and he wants to do it now." Although the episode doesn't revisit specific memorable moments from the show's past, it does mine the show's history. For example, because Castle never met Beckett, he also never wrote the Nikki Heat book series. Thus, his career took a decidedly different turn. Similarly, Castle's mother Martha (Susan Sullivan) and his daughter Alexis  (Molly Quinn) are not quite the same either. Is a Castle wedding still in the cards? 7 Teases for the new season As for what traps Castle in this alternate reality, Amann says it will be explained... sort of. "He's investigating a case that turns out to be related to a missing object which may or may not have mysterious properties to it," he says. "At the end of the episode, I think we're left with a question as to whether there was something really paranormal that went on here, or whether the explanation was a little bit more grounded in reality. So, the audience can decide for themselves which one of those things is true." And does Castle's sudden urge to get married after going through the experience throw Beckett off? "She doesn't necessarily know quite what has driven him to this point, because she hasn't experienced the story that he has," Amann says. "But I think that she's emotionally right there with him." Because the episode devotes so much time to the alternate reality, the wedding  will naturally not be as much of a production as originally planned. But Amann says that doesn't take anything away from the milestone. "We came very close to doing the other version of the big wedding... and all the hoopla that's associated with that, and we knew that we didn't want to do quite the same thing," he says. "Because Castle is driven by his experience to kind of act on the idea of getting married so quickly, we knew it was going to make it a slightly different kind of ceremony. But that being said, it's a wonderful, wonderful moment... and we hope the fans share that view." Check out Castle's Beckett and more of the sexiest TV crime fighters Yes, even those fans who shouted their anger from the rooftops after the failed wedding last season. "They will certainly be vocal, but we feel it delivers the best version of what we wanted that moment to be. There are obviously people who felt a little thwarted, and I think now that the wedding will become a reality, I think the people who felt forsaken or betrayed by the end of last season, my hope is that that earns back whatever good will we might have lost with them." As for the future of the series, Amann doesn't believe that marrying his two lead characters will fundamentally change anything. "We've been dealing with them in a relationship now for quite a period of time," he says. "There'll be things that come up now that they're married that wouldn't have come up before that'll be the source of conflict and fun, but a lot of it will revolve around similar storytelling that we've been doing since they became an official couple. It's really about finding their points of view in the cases, what's their point of conflict, and having opportunities for the fun, banter-y exchanges that we think are kind of the lifeblood of the show. We'll continue finding those opportunities." And that includes the honeymoon, when instead of relaxing in some tropical paradise, the duo will get right back to work, investigating the death of a woman who was poisoned on a dude ranch. "In the course of Castle's disappearance, Beckett burned off all her vacation days," Amann explains. "There isn't a possibility of taking a honeymoon, at least right away. So Castle sees this as a golden opportunity to kill two birds with one stone by solving a case and taking a honeymoon.   Well, that doesn't sound like much fun. "Beckett is deeply ambivalent about this being the kind of honeymoon that they would go on, but that doesn't prevent them from having a good time," Amann teases. "There will be some fun and shenanigans along the way. " Castle airs Mondays at 10/9c on ABC. Are you excited to see Castle and Beckett finally get married? 
http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2013/10/01/ford-ceo-alan-mulally-dismisses-microsoft-rumors/2900179/	Ford's Mulally dispels Microsoft CEO rumors	With resurfacing rumors about the possibility of Ford CEO Alan Mulally moving to Microsoft to run the software giant, Mulally himself downplays the speculation. He spoke exclusively with USA TODAY.ATHENS, Ga. – Despite resurfaced rumors that he is on the very short list to replace outgoing CEO Steve Ballmer at Microsoft, Ford CEO Alan Mulally maintains that that is not in his plans."I love serving Ford and have nothing new to add to (my) plans to continue serving Ford," he said in an exclusive interview with USA TODAY.Mulally was at the University of Georgia Tuesday to participate in the 16th USA TODAY CEO Forum.Over the last several weeks, media reports have mentioned Mulally as the leading candidate to succeed Ballmer as the software giant's CEO.Mulally is known for his ability to turnaround troubled companies. Before coming to Ford in 2006, Mulally spent 37 years at Boeing where he helped outflank competitor Airbus with the Boeing 777 jetliner. At Ford, he ushered in transparency and transformed the car maker into a leaner company.Even though Ford had a record loss in 2008, the company avoided government bailout loans given to GM and Chrysler. The company reported a profit the next year and has had 16 consecutive profitable quarters. On Tuesday, Ford also announced that the company's September sales were the best since 2006.Mulally has said he will stay at Ford through 2014, but the board of directors has indicated it would not stand in his way if he chooses to leave earlier.With Microsoft, Ford co-developed the Sync infotainment system that lets drivers connect their smartphones in Ford vehicles. Mulally called Microsoft "a great company" and "a great partner."He downplayed rumors early last month and Mulally's heir apparent, current chief operating officer Mark Fields dismissed reports that resurfaced last week.But the public speculation helps confirm Ford's ascendance as a technology company, Mulally admits. "Clearly, we have been leading this and it's very important to consumers," he said. "We just love the response they have to our vehicles."Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1fGPEiS

(AP) - A jury has found a Florida man guilty of first-degree murder for fatally shooting a teenager after an argument over loud music outside a Jacksonville convenience store.The jury reached its verdict Wednesday after more than five hours of deliberations.Prosecutors say Michael Dunn shot with intent to kill when he fired 10 times into an SUV carrying 17-year-old Jordan Davis and three of his friends in November 2012.Dunn testified that he thought his life was in danger. Davis was from Marietta, Georgia.Dunn was convicted previously of three counts of attempted second-degree murder in February and already faces at least 60 years in prison.The jury in the first trial deadlocked on the first-degree murder count, which led prosecutors to retry him in this case.
http://www.voanews.com/content/sierra-leone-ebola-lockdown/2455178.html	WHO Continues Ebola Fight Despite Murders	CONAKRY, GUINEA / GENEVA—The World Health Organization says it will not be deterred in efforts to combat Ebola in Guinea and other West African countries by the killing of a team of educators trying to raise awareness of the disease in a village in Guinea.“We need to continue to combat against Ebola. We need to investigate about these murders, but they should not stop us. We should continue the dialogue with the community. We should continue to explain our work," WHO Technical Officer and Ebola specialist, Pierre Formenty, told VOA."We should continue to show our empathy with the victim, with the families, with the community. Without that again, we will not be able to make our messages understood by the population and we will not be able to control it," he added.Earlier Friday, the Guinean government said it was stopping Ebola education activities in the country’s southeast after eight missing health workers and journalists were murdered there this week. Their bodies were found in a septic tank in a primary school in a nearby village on Thursday, reportedly killed by villagers fearful of the disease and suspicious of official efforts to combat it. Two other workers remain missing. Authorities have arrested at least six people in connection with the attack.Team allegedly accused of lyingA government spokesman told VOA's French to Africa service that some people do not believe Ebola exists, or that the delegation came to kill people.The regional anti-Ebola effort has been hampered by widespread fears and misinformation about the disease.A local reporter told VOA by telephone that villagers accused the delegation of spreading lies about Ebola.The delegation was trying to educate locals about Ebola, said Guinea’s prime minister, Mohamed Said Fofanah. Villagers in Wome, as in other places, are still “intoxicated by information making them believed this sickness does not exist or was created to eliminate them.”Outreach activities have become “impossible” in the southeast, said Dr. Fanta Kabba, permanent secretary at the Ministry of Health. She said efforts there will now focus just on treating the sick.“We are waiting for more details” and trying to figure out why locals resist, she said. ”… Putting in place the strategies to fight Ebola has become impossible. We cannot act when we are being prevented from acting.”WHO spokesman Tariq Jasarevic says the murders in Guinea show how challenging the effort is.  He's been to the affected area and says it will be necessary to fine-tune the Ebola information message.  “It takes really the right approach.  What we were hearing that some early interventions, teams would come without really properly explaining what they were doing," he said.  "This is understandable because people want to go fast.  Teams want to go fast and do their job. "But, then it was realized basically that there has to be a proper protocol," he noted, " that you really have to go not only to village leaders and community leaders-When we went there, we really had to get all the village to a central place and talk to all of them for three hours.”  Jasarevic says the more patient approach paid off, and after three hours of talking, the villagers brought out three people suspected of having Ebola so they could be tested for the disease. Third attack on health workersThis is third major attack on health workers in southeastern Guinea since the regional outbreak began there early this year.Minister of Communication Alucine Makanera, who was in Wome, told VOA the murdered workers had marks indicating they were attacked with machetes and stones."We have the state prosecutor with us to find out the cause of the attack," Makanera said. “He has already opened judicial investigations, and within few days or weeks we should know more."Many residents of Wome fled following the attack, he said, and security forces are deployed there now. Authorities have arrested at least six people in connection with the murders.The incident has sent shock waves through the country, with many Guineans calling for strong sanctions against the culprits.Sierra Leone on lockdownThe streets of Sierra Leone's capital were mostly empty Friday, as the nation began a three-day lockdown to find hidden Ebola cases and stop the spread of the deadly disease.Tens of thousands of health workers are going door to door in the West African country, informing people of how to avoid Ebola and asking suspected Ebola patients to come to treatment centers.Health care workers in Sierra Leone aim to hit every household in the country of six million.  During their neighborhood canvassing, they are handing out bars of soap and information on how to prevent infections as well as trying to isolate the sick.President Ernest Bai Koroma appealed to all Sierra Leoneans to stay home Friday, Saturday and Sunday, saying in a televised address that "extraordinary times require extraordinary measures."  Critics say the exercise could be chaotic and ineffective. Click to enlargeThe Ebola outbreak in West Africa is of historic proportions.  It has killed more than 2,600 people across West Africa this year - including more than 560 people in Sierra Leone.Sierra Leone's six million residents were told to stay home Friday, Saturday and Sunday while volunteers go door to door, looking for hidden Ebola cases and giving people information on how to avoid the deadly disease.Health experts have criticized the shutdown, arguing the coercive measures could drive some people into hiding and could be extremely hard to implement.U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has announced the creation of the U.N. Mission for Ebola Emergency Response to be based in the affected region.The United States announced this week that, at Liberia's request, Washington would deploy 3,000 U.S. troops to West Africa to coordinate the medical and humanitarian response to Ebola.The soldiers will be based in Monrovia and tasked with training medical workers, managing supplies and building new treatment facilities.China offers more aidOn Thursday, China committed 200 million yuan, or about $33 million, in new emergency aid to the U.N., targeted to containing Ebola epidemic, the Associated Press reported. The country also offered $2 million to the World Health Organization and the African Union to fight the disease. A team of 59 Chinese laboratory specialists arrived in Sierra Leone Thursday to assist with testing. To date, China has sent 174 medical experts to the region.   WHO chief Margaret Chan said earlier this month "human resources" are the biggest need in response to the outbreak.Chan said "we most especially need compassionate doctors and nurses" who know how to comfort patients despite the barriers of wearing personal protective equipment and working under "very demanding conditions."A French volunteer nurse working for Doctors Without Borders who contracted Ebola in Liberia returned home Friday. She is now receiving experimental treatments. Some information for this report was drawn from Reuters and the Associated Press.

http://www.voanews.com/content/us-deploys-more-troops-to-iraq/2512484.html	Obama Authorizes Up to 1,500 More Troops for Iraq	U.S. President Barack Obama has authorized the U.S. military to deploy up to 1,500 more troops to Iraq in a non-combat role as part of the mission to drive back Islamic State militants.The U.S. military's expanded mission in Iraq will total up to about 3,100 American troops spread across the country.A senior administration official said the coalition will set up two advise-and-assist operation centers, one likely in Anbar province, an area intensely embroiled in the fight against Islamic State, and another likely in northern Baghdad province.The official said about 870 of the troops heading to Iraq will help train nine Iraqi force brigades and three Kurdish Peshmerga brigades. The training will take place in Diala, Anbar, Irbil and Baghdad provinces.Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said the training mission will take time."It's going to take us, probably a couple of months, two to three months, to get the sites prepared and the regimen started. And then the training itself we anticipate, the training regimen itself, to take six-seven months," he said.Before this order, U.S. troops in Iraq largely stayed at operation centers in Baghdad and Irbil.The president has asked for more than $5 billion from Congress to fund the mission. Admiral Kirby said the military needs the funding and authorization from Congress in order to carry out the expansion.  The increase has drawn comparisons with the last time U.S. forces were in Iraq between 2003 and 2011. Kirby said Friday, though, U.S. troops are entering a "completely different situation" this time."First, we're going in at the request of the Iraqi government. We're wanted there. We weren't wanted to stay there after 2011," he said. "Number two, there's a very acute threat that's facing the Iraqi people, the Iraqi government and Iraqi security forces -- a threat that they are trying to grapple with right now and they have acknowledged that they need a little bit of help in that regard."With the aid of U.S. air strikes, Iraqi forces have dealt a number of blows to Islamic State militants in recent weeks. Islamic State fighters have lost a string of towns near the Syrian border, and last week, Iraqi forces recaptured the town of Jurf al-Sakher, about 60 kilometers southwest of Baghdad.

It's not a surprise then that some would seek to try and capture a bit of that feeling, albeit for a lower price then the seven-figure price tag that Pagani vehicles command. Creating a replica of a Pagani is no easy task, and most should just leave the job alone. The builder of this Pagani Huayra replica decided to take things up a notch... by replicating a car that Pagani doesn't even build at the moment—a Huayra Roadster.MUST SEE: Man Builds Batmobile & Becomes Real Life Superhero To Sick ChildrenThe Huayra is an amazing machine, but it's not a roofless machine yet. There are rumors that such a car could be coming at some point in the future, but that time isn't now. That hasn't stopped the Chinese builder of the above picture machine from creating his own vision of the future car.Although we've seen some pretty good replicas from Chinese builders in the past, we don't quite agree with the vision of this one. It's immediately clear that this car is not the real deal. Additionally, we don't think that front windscreen is going to pass any sort of safety test.

http://news.yahoo.com/4-old-old-boys-body-found-horry-county-174505508.html	Body of autistic boy, 4, found in South Carolina pond	LITTLE RIVER, S.C. (AP) — The body of an autistic, 4-year-old boy who had been missing since Christmas Eve has been found in a pond in South Carolina.Coroner Robert Edge told local media outlets that the body of Jayden Morrison was found late Friday morning in Little River, northeast of Myrtle Beach.Police, first responders, K9 units, dive teams and volunteers had been searching for the boy since he disappeared from his grandmother's house around 5:30 p.m. Wednesday.The New York boy's family had been visiting his grandmother. His mother, Tabatha Morrison, had gone shopping and left her three children at the home.Jayden's grandmother, Carolyn Sumpter, said minutes later, she noticed the front door was ajar and began the search."We've always been in a gated situation," Jayden's father, Andre Morrison, told reporters said Thursday afternoon after he arrived from New York.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jota-echevarraa/spain-ebola-sierra-leone_b_5978662.html?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000592	Letter From a Spanish Ebola Expert in Sierra Leone	I am a Spanish doctor in Sierra Leone working with an NGO on the matter of Ebola which, as you know, has been hitting part of Africa for more than six months, and that now, unfortunately, has reached Spain. This was the first case of direct transmission of Ebola outside of an African country in the history of the disease.We are launching in Bo, which is the second largest city in Sierra Leone, a center of isolation and treatment for Ebola patients. Both suspected and confirmed cases, are hosted in the center as the first symptoms appear, which is usually fever, displayed when disease begins to be potentially infectious. The pertinent tests are made and we take care of the patients until we have the results from the laboratory. If it is negative, the patient goes home, but a medical team will visit daily and will monitor the patient and his relatives for three weeks. If the result is positive, we start the intensive care and treatment of the patient.So this is how it works in a country where there are, so far, over 2,400 positive cases and nearly 700 deaths, according to reports from the Health Department. Although there are probably more, considering that communication did not work very well and there may be many lost cases. It is known, thanks to the wide media coverage of this issue, that each infected person can infect 2-6 people.Madam Health Secretary, with all due respect, something went wrong. And honestly, I think the information you are giving to the media in Spain on the sad and unfortunate case of an infected colleague, while still being true, is not entirely accurate. Here, on the ground, where we live the day-to-day of this disease, we have another point of view, and certainly very different responses from the ones the government and some officials are giving.It is not my intention to distress anyone or create alarmist situations, but they are making up the facts. Or they are not saying things clearly. I do not want to believe it's on purpose, I prefer to think it is due to ignorance of the subject and not really knowing what they are speaking of.You should be aware by now that the personal protective equipment, technically called PPE (Personal Protection Equipment, although I will call them protective suits to shorten up) which were used as protection were not adequate for this disease. As you may know, WHO has different degrees of protection according to the disease addressed, and Ebola requires the highest level of protection for its severity, high risk of infection and, above all, the lack of knowledge professionals have of it. The appropriate protective suits isolates completely from the environment -- there is not a micron of uncovered or unprotected skin -- and some elements are double, as in the case of the gloves.My colleagues who regularly enter a danger zone, isolation zone or may be in contact with suspected or confirmed patients, in addition to wearing the protective suit, receive two weeks of training in a suitable center by qualified professionals. In our case, here in Sierra Leone, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) gives us the training, with professionals with greater experience, the ones who know best how to treat and manage Ebola.Protective measures are much more than the protective suit and they are constantly carried out (spray with chlorinated water, containers for hand washing with chlorinated water in each corner, disinfection with this same type of water for shoe soles, etc.). Just so you have an idea: proper placing of the protective suit (PPE) takes about 10 minutes, and the removal of it is a process of about 20 to 25 minutes where some orderly steps are strictly followed and supervised by two people: one, continuously disinfected with spray; and another, who remembers the steps to follow. Even the experts in the issue, who go in and out of the risky areas several times a day -- because you can not be in a protective suit of this type for more than an hour due to dehydration risk -- even those widely accustomed to the long and tedious process to apply and remove the personal protective equipment, sometimes forget steps or they are wrong about the order of processes and protocols, and this can lead to infection.To prove it here is this fact: over 90 percent of infected health workers (which are many), were infected by not following the proper protocols or for not wearing a proper protective suit, all due to human mistake. The other 10 percent were infected outside the work environment, by a relative, sex, etc.Anyway, I will not bore you more, but it is all very complex and it is not surprising that unfortunately there has been a contagion. I wish this begins and ends here and that you learn of the mistakes (if any) and, above all, that everything goes well for the infected colleague.Yours sincerely, Dr. Jose Maria EchevarríaThis post first appeared on El Huffington Post.

ISIS bragged about the nuclear device on social media as a British extremist fighter claimed it would wreak havoc in London when it explodes.According to media reports, ISIS militants have stolen 40 kilogrammes of uranium in July and used it to make a "dirty bomb." The Mirror noted that British bomb expert Hamayun Tariq was identified as among the militants who issued threats to the West online. In 2012, he left his home in Dudley and went to the Middle East.On his Twitter account under the Muslim name, Muslim al-Britani, he announced that ISIS has a dirty bomb and revealed they militants found radioactive material at the Iraqi university in Mosul. He went on to say ISIS will study what dirty bombs can do and talk about what happens when it is detonated in a public area.In what may be viewed as a veiled threat, the British ISIS supporter added that it would be "terribly destructive" if it exploded in London.  His account on Twitter has since been suspended after posting his comments. As a show of support, other ISIS fighters also posted on Twitter to confirm that militants have in their possession a bomb from radioactive material in Mosul.Reports of ISIS having a nuclear device have alarmed the UN Ambassador to Iraq Mohamed Ali Alhakin. He wrote a letter to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and revealed that ISIS has been taking nuclear material from areas where the group has taken over. The ambassador informed the UN that such material can be used to manufacture "weapons of mass destruction." Alhakin warned that nuclear materials, even in limited quantities, can enable terrorist groups like ISIS to use it in the militants' terror campaign with the help a weapons expert.The Mirror speculates that if ISIS has a nuclear bomb, the group would more likely use it in Iraq or Syria rather than risk being caught when smuggling it into a Western country.  Previous reports indicate that if ISIS was confirmed to have weapons of mass destruction or a nuclear bomb, U.S. President Barack Obama would not hesitate to send ground troops to destroy ISIS.To contact the editor, e-mail:
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/10/21/air-travelers-from-west-africa-banned-from-all-but-five-us-airports-ebola/20981803/	Air travelers from West Africa banned from all but 5 US airports over Ebola fears	The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has announced all travelers from the West African countries stricken with Ebola must travel to the U.S. through one of only five airports.Travelers from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea are being forced to travel through the five airports previously announced as Ebola screening centers for international travelers, officials said in a statement.Those five airports are New York-JFK, Newark Liberty, Washington, D.C. Dulles, Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson and Chicago O'Hare.All passengers taking flights from West Africa to these five airports will be subject to "secondary screening and added protocols, including having their temperature taken, before they can be admitted into the United States," officials said."We are working closely with the airlines to implement these restrictions with minimal travel disruption," said DHS secretary Jeh Johnson. "If not already handled by the airlines, the few impacted travelers should contact the airlines for rebooking, as needed."There presently are no direct flights from those countries into the U.S.It was also further announced that any passengers who have traveled into the country from West Africa during the preceding 21 days will also be screened for the deadly virus.The restrictions come one month after Liberian national Thomas Duncan arrived in Dallas on September 20. He died October 8 from Ebola and two nurses have subsequently become infected."The Department of Homeland Security's policy to funnel all passengers arriving from Ebola hotspots to one of these five equipped airports is a good and effective step towards tightening the net and further protecting our citizens," said Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY).This may be the first of many steps aimed at stemming the flow of infected people into the U.S."We are continually evaluating whether additional restrictions or added screening and precautionary measures are necessary to protect the American people and will act accordingly," said Johnson.

According to Mail Online, the reality star is just having fun, and isn’t bothered by reports that her on-again boyfriend has been making out with other chicks. Despite her family’s “warnings” about the rapper, Khloe is doing her own thing… and she’s happy.“Khloe doesn’t care if he has a side piece and thinks her family should stay out of her business,” said a source. Apparently some of Khloe’s family members have sat her down for a heart-to-heart of sorts, but she reportedly explained to them that she and French weren’t exclusive, and that he’s welcome to do whatever he wants.Khloe doesn’t care if French Montana wants to do his own thing, which suggests that the two aren’t really serious. Of course this completely negates other reports that the two are falling in love, and are thinking about taking their relationship to the next level. According to Hollywood Life, French has been “looking at rings,” and is just waiting for Khloe’s marriage to Lamar Odom to be over with so that he can actually propose.“He wants to propose to her after she and Lamar are done. He’s been looking at rings and he even went to Mr. Flawless to buy something for her for Christmas,” said a source. Of course, French might want to spoil Khloe for the holidays, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that he’s going to buy her an engagement ring. Their relationship has always been fun, and they don’t take each other too seriously, which is good for Khloe, since she is just getting out of a stressful marriage.Although Khloe says she doesn’t care about what French Montana does in his spare time, there has to be a part of her that wants him to commit to her, right? French has been spending a good deal of time with Khloe’s family, even when she’s not around. Naturally that suggests that a guy is really into a girl, but in this case, it could be for publicity.In fact, as previously reported by the Inquisitr, there was a report that French was actually using Kim Kardashian to cover his own behind while in Dubai. Apparently he was seen making out with a woman while overseas, but posted a few pictures with Kim so that Khloe would think that he was “behaving himself.”But, if she doesn’t care, that’s probably not what French was doing.[Photo courtesy of Timothy White/E!]

Local police officers were called to the restaurant late Wednesday on a "report of suspicious activity." Turns out that suspicious activity — or lack thereof —  was the couple deep asleep in the middle of the Golden Corral.The man was sleeping "face down in a plate of food." The police noted in a Facebook post that an "officer saved the man's life by waking him up so he didn't inhale food and choke." While the man was eventually released, the woman was arrested for possession of a controlled substance. Perhaps it was best the couple fell asleep and couldn't finish their meals, given the chain's earlier troubles.Eater Video: Essential Kitchen Knives, with Chef Paul Liebrandt | Subscribe to Eater on YouTube

(AP Photo/Frank Franklin II)The New York Jets reprimanded quarterback Geno Smith for tossing around a football with a friend two days after having surgery to fix his fractured jaw.Smith had been told to avoid activity after surgery, which became a necessity after he was punched in the face by former teammate I.K. Enemkpali in a dispute Tuesday over money Smith owed.“[Smith] shouldn’t be doing it right now,”  Coach Todd Bowles said of Smith’s activity level (via NJ.com). “We handled that internally. We had that discussion.”Smith’s activities came to light when photos of him throwing to a friend at his apartment complex near the Jets’ Florham Park, N.J., facility were published Saturday.“I feel great,” Smith told the Post. “You see me throwing, right? … Get ready for me to come back.”Smith, whose jaw was broken in two places, is expected to be out six-to-10 weeks and saw Jets doctors on Sunday. Although his jaw was not wired shut, metal plates and screws were used in the surgery Thursday.“He just got surgery; you don’t want him getting infected,” Bowles said. “[The doctors] said he couldn’t do anything physical, so I’m going by the rules of what they said.”
http://nypost.com/2014/12/24/lying-about-the-cops/	Stop lying about the cops	We have heard a lot lately about tensions between the police and the communities that they serve, and the urgent need to reduce them. Here’s an easy first step: Stop lying about the cops.The “national conversation” about race and policing we’ve been having ever since Michael Brown was shot by Officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Mo., last summer has been based on lies.The lie that Officer Wilson shot Brown while he had his hands up and was pleading “Don’t shoot.”The lie that New York City policemen targeted Eric Garner for a violent arrest because he was black.The lie, peddled especially by the progressive prince of New York City, Mayor de Blasio, that the police are racist.These are the lies that fuel hatred for the police, because if the police routinely execute black men in cold blood and serve a thoroughly racist system, they deserve to be hated.They should be the subject of nightly protests. They should be showered with obloquy.They should be harried by Attorney General Eric Holder.They should be considered a stain on the national conscience to be extricated at all costs.This is the line of reasoning that leads to protesters chanting: “What do we want? Dead cops. When do we want them? Now.”His rote praise of the police notwithstanding, especially now that he is under so much political pressure after the murders of Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu, Mayor de Blasio is deeply invested in this smear.It is why he has made career anti-police agitator Al Sharpton practically deputy police commissioner.It is why he considers the police a clear and present danger to his biracial son, Dante.It is why he said the tragic death of Eric Garner in police custody was the product of “centuries of racism.”The logic of the de Blasio view tends toward the conclusion that the police are unbelievably insidious: They recruit people of all races to go into dangerous neighborhoods on the pretense of protecting innocent people there, when in reality the mission is to harass black kids and, should the opportunity arise, kill them.If this were true, it would make the police as a class not just racists, but sociopaths.It fails the basic standard of common sense, and defies the numbers.As Heather Mac Donald of City Journal writes: “Criminologists have spent decades trying to prove that the overrepresentation of blacks and Hispanic in prison demonstrates that the criminal justice system is racist. And each time they fail. Even the most left-wing academics have been forced to admit that crime, not race, determines criminal justice outcomes.”Police go where the crime is, and at considerable risk to themselves.Surely, if their own comfort and safety were all that mattered to them, they would spend all their time patrolling the poshest neighborhoods in America.Police critics have taken Ferguson and Garner and have woven them into a narrative of reckless disregard for the lives of blacks.After the grand jury declined to indict in the Garner case, de Blasio referred to a “profound” crisis. The numbers suggest the opposite: As crime has declined — thanks, in part, to rigorous policing — police interactions with the public have declined and have involved fewer instances of the use of force.Our national conversation has been a national fever. Now, perhaps it will break.As Jaden Ramos, the 13-year-old son of Rafael Ramos, wrote in a heartbreaking Facebook post about his dad:“Everyone says they hate cops but they are the people that they call for help.”There is more wisdom in that simple statement than in most of the cable chatter, protest chants and op-eds written in the wake of Ferguson and the Garner case.If we really want to reduce tensions between the community and men like Officer Rafael Ramos, it is imperative, first, to stop lying about the police.
http://www.examiner.com/article/before-we-convict-kurt-busch	Before we convict Kurt Busch	Play The latest from Motorsports: Kurt Busch and his struggle to the top of Sprint Cup standings, Nationwide Series Race news and Allen Johnson advances to semi finals at the NHRA Thunder Valley Nationals. on.aol.comKurt Busch is in trouble again. The former NASCAR champion has been known to show his anger on many occasions; he’s been fired from high profile NASCAR teams on at least two occasions after angry outbursts. And NASCAR has fined him on more than one occasion.Kurt Busch and Patricia Driscoll Greg Engle, Getty Images View all 15 photosGetty ImagesThis time however, it’s much more serious.The 2014 NASCAR Sprint Cup season started out with a great deal of promise for Busch. The newly signed driver with Stewart-Haas Racing won early in the season and made NASCAR’s Chase. He also made a high profile appearance outside of NASCAR taking on the racing double on the Indy 500 and the Coke 600 at Charlotte in May. He finished 6th at Indy garnering Rookie of the Year honors. Photos from that day featured not only Busch but also the same pretty blonde woman along with a young boy that had been seen with him for some time. I could see them from the press box at Charlotte Motor Speedway as they exited a helicopter in the frontstretch grass. The couple held hands and Busch waved to the crowd who were enthusiastically applauding him. The little boy was close by; all were smiling. Busch, who was married for five year and suffered through a tumultuous divorce, seemed to finally be in a good place, on top of the world.Busch and the woman, Patricia Driscoll, along with her 8-year old son from a previous marriage, looked quite happy together that day in Charlotte. In fact there seemed to be a great deal of happiness for Busch and Driscoll. Driscoll, President and Executive Director of the Armed Forces Foundation, and Busch met a few years prior at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and she said it was love at first sight.“It is funny how you walk up to someone, you know that your life is about to change forever and you just get that strange feeling,” Driscoll said in 2012. “I just knew that my life was changing forever, it was just something and I couldn't put my finger on it.”That same kind of love seemed to carry over to Busch. He called Driscoll’s son his “adopted step-son” among other things. When he made the Chase at Richmond, Busch was quite emotional and later said why.“The big emotion Saturday night in Richmond when we locked into the Chase was little Houston,” Busch told reporters the following week. “It's Patricia's 8-year-old, and I'm an adopted step dad with him. He had a summer-long list of things he wanted to do, ride his go-kart, go camping, fishing, just things that an 8-year-old would want to do, play video games. He said he wanted to bungee jump, but we had to drop that off the list.“But one thing that I didn't get done for him that he had on his list, he wanted to go to victory lane, “ Busch referring to Houston’s list of thing he wanted to do in the summer.”So I felt like getting him to the Chase stage was that moment for us to share together, so I lived up as a step dad to his expectations.”That happiness seems to have ended the week prior to the September 28th race at Dover International Speedway. Busch and Driscoll had parted ways the previous week. Despite this, Driscoll went to Dover, fearing for her former boyfriend after the NASCAR Sprint qualifying session on September 26th. According to Mark Dycio, Driscoll's Virginia-based attorney, Driscoll went to the track worried about Busch after getting text messages from Busch."There had been communication and she believed it was a cry for help, so she responded," Dycio told The Associated Press.After her arrival, things seemed to deteriorate. According to court documents, Busch accused Driscoll of "having spies everywhere and having a camera on the bus to watch him." More concerning, again according to the court documents, Busch then allegedly physically assaulted Driscoll pushing her face against the wall several times. Driscoll said she escaped and took refuge in a nearby motorhome. She said she suffered severe pain, difficulty breathing and neck bruising because of the assault.A hearing has been set for December 2.If Busch is convicted of the allegations against him, he should suffer the full weight the justice system can bring to bear. There is never, under any circumstances an excuse for physically, or verbally for that matter, assaulting another person, especially for a man to lay hands on a woman. No excuse ever, period.However, amidst the media storm surrounding the incident, I hope there are several things that everyone will remember. Busch has sought help for his anger issues in the past, and obviously it hasn’t worked. No matter what happens in the court, and again he will deserve everything coming to him if the allegations are proven true and he is convicted, let’s hope that Busch gets the real help he obviously needs. As a psychologist, I can attest to the fact that the end of a relationship rarely has a happy ending. Everyone involved loses, getting back ones heart is never an easy thing. In this instance, the relationship wasn’t a short term fling; Busch looked genuinely happy and in a very good place. No doubt his life is a very dark place to be right now. And while he again (if convicted) deserves everything coming to him in court, I sincerely hope that that people have compassion for a man who is obviously suffering a great deal, as is Driscoll. She gave her heart to someone who she no doubt felt was going to take good care of it for a long time. She loved Busch enough to allow the most precious thing any woman can have, her child, to be part of the relationship.Finally there is that little boy. The 8-year old has lost the second father in his life. There is a great deal of evidence to show how much Busch loved little Houston. Now that little boy is probably confused, angry and very, very hurt.There are no winners. Busch will need to suffer through whatever he has coming to him from the judicial system, Driscoll will have to reconcile the love she has lost while trying to help her son suffer through what is likely one of the worst periods of his young life. Let’s hope that when the dust finally settles, Busch gets the help he seems to so desperately need, that Driscoll can somehow find the courage to move on and that an 8-year old boy can someday understand that while love isn’t always forever, hearts can be repaired and life can be happy once again.
http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/rosenblog/chi-bears-packers-sunday-night-debacle-20141109-column.html	Why wasn't Marc Trestman fired at halftime?	I started writing this at the end of the first quarter, hoping to get it posted by hafltime because I wanted the Bears to fire Marc Trestman before the start of the third quarter.Geez, it was 42-0, Packers, at halftime, so how much worse could it be if the coach had been whacked after two quarters? Trestman’s team has allowed 80 points in the last two first halves combined, so again, how much worse could it be without the guy?Trestman deserves it. Bears fans deserves to see him whacked. What happened on Sunday night in front of God and NBC was a pathetic excuse for preparation and execution by a coach who has become a disaster at preparing his team to execute.The Bears organization, however, deserves to see Trestman stay because those wonks are too stupid to know how awful this is. If they cared, they’d have listened to me when I screamed that Trestman should’ve been canned after the Dolphins game. Certainly after the Patriots game.But no. Nobody at the toxic waste dump that is Halas Hall did a thing about it. Bears wonks have a high tolerance for being a laughingstock, as we all know.And that’s how you get a 42-0 national TV embarrassment against the Bears’ biggest rival in their biggest game of a death-spiral of a season. Trestman’s Bears came out bad and stupid, and then looked like they quit or wanted to.In the first quarter alone, Trestman’s offense was flagged for a false start, delay-of-game, and a personal foul.Oh, and Jay Cutler threw his regularly scheduled interception and the Bears ran Matt Forte just twice in the first eight plays against the worst rushing defense in the league.That’s some valuable work Trestman and his staff did during the off week, eh?You know how little the Packers feared the Bears offense? They went for it on fourth-and-goal from the 1 way back when the game was scoreless. They didn’t value the field goal. The Packers knew they’d get the ball back without trouble.And they did. And they scored TD after TD after TD.Trestman’s defensive coordinator still can’t teach his players to communicate checks and coverages. This goes back to Chris Conte and last season’s finale against the same Packers. This is an on-going embarrassment and now a national joke.Bad enough that Mel Tucker and his defense are too stupid to double-cover Jordy Nelson, but they’re also too inept to even single-cover him for more than five yards. Nice coaching, teaching and execution.That’s some complementary football, Coach Trestman.But wait. There’s more stupidity. Trestman's special teams coach continues to tell his guys to bring the ball out of the end zone on kickoff returns when nobody can get to the 20-yard line without Uber.At 3-6, the Bears are done. They are hopeless. They are leaderless. They appeared heartless at times in the first half Sunday. How much more damning evidence does Emery need?Emery has to fire Trestman now. He has no other option if he wants to keep his job, and even then, Emery still might get whacked.Emery’s odd choice of coach has destroyed all hope for the next three years because the Trestman decision was tied to the $54 million the GM guaranteed to Cutler.Emery could’ve franchise-tagged the erratic quarterback for one year and let him walk if he played as badly as, well, he has played this year. Emery could’ve whacked Trestman, too, and started over.How good would that option be now? How dreadful will the remainder of Cutler’s contract feel now?It’s over. Trestman’s career here. Emery’s career here. Maybe Ted Phillips’, too. Maybe they can get a group rate for the national convention of village idiots.
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/12/09/lawmakers-agree-on-1-1-trillion-spending-bill/21011075/	Lawmakers agree on $1.1 trillion spending bill	WASHINGTON (AP) - Time running short, Republicans and Democrats agreed Tuesday on a $1.1 trillion spending bill to avoid a government shutdown and delay a politically-charged struggle over President Barack Obama's new immigration policy until the new year.In an unexpected move, lawmakers also agreed on legislation expected to be incorporated into the spending measure that will permit a reduction in benefits for current retirees at economically distressed multiemployer pension plans. Supporters said it was part of an effort to prevent a slow-motion collapse of a system that provides retirement income to millions, but critics objected vehemently.There was no immediate reaction from the White House to the bill.At 1,603 pages, the spending bill adheres to strict caps negotiated earlier between the White House and deficit- conscious Republicans, and is also salted with GOP policy proposals. As described by unhappy liberals, one would roll back new regulations that prohibit banks from using federal deposit insurance to cover investments on some complex financial instruments.Elsewhere, there were trade-offs. Republicans won a $60 million cut at the Environmental Protection Agency, and said the agency's workforce would be reduced to the lowest level since 1989. Democrats emerged with increases for enforcement activities at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission."The federal government's going to run out of money in two days. ... We've been trying to work with Republican leaders to avoid a shutdown," Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said at midafternoon as final negotiations dragged on.Speaker John Boehner said he hoped for a vote on the measure on Thursday, and officials expressed confidence they could overcome opposition from tea party-backed Republicans and avoid a government shutdown.House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi issued a statement that said she was hopeful her rank and file could support the bill, but needed to review the final language.Senate approval would then be required to send it to Obama - one of the final acts of a two-year Congress far better known for gridlock than for accomplishment.Not only a two-year Congress, but also a political era was drawing to a close as the lights burned late inside the Capitol on a December night.For the first time in eight years, Republicans will have a Senate majority in January after their hugely successful midterm election, and newly elected GOP senators-elect participated in closed-door strategy sessions during the day.Before time runs out on his majority, Reid said he wanted to assure confirmation of nine more of Obama's judicial nominees and approve the appointment of Vivek Murthy as surgeon general.Also on Congress' must-do list is legislation to renew a series of expiring tax breaks, and a bill to authorize the Pentagon to train and equip Syrian rebels to fight Islamic State forces in the Middle East.The compromise spending bill will permit virtually the entire government to operate normally through the Sept. 30 end of the fiscal year, with the exception of the Department of Homeland Security.Funds for that one agency will run out again on Feb. 27, when Republicans are expected to try and use the expiration as leverage to force Obama to roll back a decision suspending the threat of deportation for an estimated 4 million immigrants living in the country illegally.Not all Republicans agreed with the strategy of postponing a fight over immigration. Some conservative lawmakers demanded a change deny the use of federal funds to carry out the president's new policy.Earlier in the day, House Republicans removed one obstacle to passage of the spending measure by announcing they would pass legislation separately to renew a requirement for the federal government to assume some of the insurance risk in losses arising from terrorism.In talks with Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Republicans led by Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas., agreed to the renewal, but said they wanted to roll back portions of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law that tightened federal regulation on the financial sector.The stand-alone bill seemed likely to clear the House, but its fate in the Senate was uncertain.The pension-related talks between Rep. John Kline, R-Min., and George Miller, D-Calif., were designed to preserve benefits of current and future retirees at lower levels than currently exist, but higher than they would be if their pension funds ran out of money."We have a plan here that first and foremost works for the members of the unions, the workers in these companies and it works for the companies," said Miller, retiring at year's end after four decades in Congress.The AARP, which claims to represent millions of retirement-age Americans, attacked the agreement as a "secret, last-minute closed door deal between a group of companies, unions and Washington politicians to cut the retirement benefits that have been promised to them."Also driving the talks was concern over the financial fate of the fund that insures multiemployer pensions at the government's Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. The agency said in its most recent annual report that the fund's deficit rose to $42.2 billion in the fiscal year ending Sept, 30, up from $8.3 billion the previous year, and that the likelihood of its bankruptcy is 90 percent by 2025.Agency figures show as many as 1.5 million retirees could be affected by any change in law to permit a reduction. An estimated 400,000 of them receive benefits from the Teamsters' Central States Pension Fund.___Associated Press writers Alan Fram, Connie Cass and Erica Werner contributed to this report.

Hunger Games hunk Liam Hemsworth rediscovered his bliss after breaking up with Miley Cyrus, and it was all thanks to the good people who reinvigorated him along the way."I'm more comfortable in my own skin than I've ever been," Hemsworth, 24, told the Associated Press after his breakup last fall. Indeed, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part I actor has made a series of big life strides in the last year: Hemsworth broke off his engagement with pop star Cyrus, 21, in late 2013, traveled around the world for several big-budget movie roles, and purchased a $6.8 million Malibu pad in August.PHOTOS: Liam and Miley -- the way they wereOne thing is clear: Single and successful, Hemsworth has a new lease on life.

http://www.chicagotribune.com/sns-wp-blm-news-bc-bg-editorial-russia03-20141203-story.html	Putin isn't the worst that could happen in Russia	The following editorial appears on Bloomberg View:Vladimir Putin may not be too concerned about the economic repercussions of his standoff with the West, but the rest of the world should be: The Russian president is taking his country straight down a path that could lead to a regime much worse than his.Western sanctions and falling oil prices have sharply worsened the prognosis for an economy that was already struggling before Russia sent troops into neighboring Ukraine. The ruble is plummeting, the government is spending billions of dollars to shore up banks, and crucial projects — such as the planned South Stream natural-gas pipeline to Europe — are being scrapped or put on hold. This week, a senior official said the country may enter a full-blown recession in the first quarter of next year.In the short term, Putin appears well equipped to survive the malaise. His military adventures and the attendant propaganda have boosted his approval ratings to new highs. Even the sanctions to some extent play into his hands, allowing him to cast economic suffering as a necessary consequence of standing up to the West, rather than a result of his own mismanagement. In one stroke, Putin has rewritten Russia's social compact, justifying the Kremlin's grip on power not with the promise of prosperity but with an appeal to nationalist pride.In the longer term, though, Putin's position is more precarious. His ability to mollify soldiers, state workers and pensioners — and to distribute billions of dollars in contracts to powerful allies — depends heavily on the oil and gas revenue that make up about half of the federal budget. Although the government has set aside almost $90 billion to insure against an energy slump, prices are now so low that Russia could easily burn through the rainy-day fund in a couple of years. If borrowing remains difficult, Putin will then face the politically fraught task of cutting spending or raising taxes to make ends meet.Putin's return to Cold War politics will only reduce the chances of a healthy recovery and diversification away from dependence on oil. The innovative, well-educated people needed to create a vibrant economy typically don't want to live in a pariah state, where they can't speak freely or choose their leaders — and where whatever they build can be stolen by corrupt officials. From 2011 through 2013, the first two years of Putin's latest presidency, annual emigration quintupled, and the number of active individual entrepreneurs declined by about 13 percent.Meanwhile, Putin is encouraging a dangerous strand of nationalism that he may not be able to control. Moscow's meddling in Ukraine has helped make heroes out of some very unsavory figures — such as Igor Girkin (aka Igor Strelkov), a leader of the pro-Russian rebellion who fancies himself a fighter in a greater war against a morally corrupt West. Some extreme nationalists now view Girkin as a potential challenger to Putin.The longer Russia's economic malaise lasts, the greater the chances that the opposition to Putin will turn into something more virulent. At that point, unless some faction of Russia's elite managed to remove Putin and hold free and fair elections, revolution would be the most likely route to regime change. The middle-class Muscovites who led the rebellion of 2011 and 2012 failed because too few of them were desperate enough to risk their lives. Next time around, the outcome could be different — and much worse.
http://news.yahoo.com/arkansas-teen-arrested-failed-attempt-drivers-license-165611951.html	Arkansas teen arrested after failed attempt at driver's license	By Steve BarnesLITTLE ROCK Ark. (Reuters) - An Arkansas teenager's attempt to land a driver's license landed him in jail after he was charged with driving to the test site without a license and smashing into a state trooper's patrol car and a house when trying to flee.Damontay Wright, 19, was seen by police driving himself to a test site on Monday in Jonesboro, in the northeastern part of the state. But when a state trooper approached Wright to issue a citation for driving without a license the teenager fled, the police said on Thursday.Wright's vehicle then struck a state police car, causing minor damage. With state and local officers in high-speed pursuit Wright attempted to navigate an intersection, but lost control of his car and plowed into a residence, police reports said.Damage to the house was estimated at $20,000, the reports said.Wright, who was not injured, was taken to jail and on charges including felony fleeing. Police said the license plate on Wright's car had been reported stolen.A lawyer for Wright was not immediately available for comment.As for when Wright might actually take the driver's license test?"That will be addressed when he's released from jail and any fines paid," said Bill Sadler, spokesman for the Arkansas State Police.(Reporting by Steve Barnes; editing by Jon Herskovitz and G Crosse)

Backed by Sentebale, which was co-founded by the prince, the initiative hopes that by getting celebrities and advocates alike to open up, more people will come forward about their HIV status.The jocular royal’s reveal showed a subdued side the public rarely sees.“I get incredibly nervous before public speaking no matter how big the crowd or the audience,” Harry said in a video posted to YouTube, “and despite the fact that I laugh and joke all the time I get incredibly nervous, if not anxious actually, before going into rooms full of people when I’m wearing a suit.”For Harry, who typically works to keep his private life under wraps, sharing his own vulnerabilities was worthwhile if it meant getting people to pay attention to the AIDS crisis where he focuses his efforts.Sentebale works with underserved children in Lesotho where more than 37,000 children under 14 live with HIV, according to the organization. Yet, despite the prevalence of the issue, many kids are reluctant to come forward about their status because of the heavy stigma they face.To protect these children and to encourage them to get the help they need, Sentebale’s Mamohato Network and Camps educates kids about HIV, encourages them to inform their peers and connects them with lifesaving treatments.Throughout the day, Harry will be joined by a number of celebrities, including actress Gemma Arterton, singer Nicole Scherzinger, in sharing their secrets to help break the stigma.“We are turning this World Aids Day into a day in which no-one should feel any shame about their secrets,” he said in a statement. "Together, we can tackle the stigma surrounding HIV and give the young people carrying it the childhood they deserve. The childhood so many of us take for granted."Find out more about how you can support the campaign here and tweet your secret with the hashtag #FeelNoShame to get involved.
http://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/la-sp-lakers-20141014-story.html	After sorry exhibition it's OK to ask: Are Lakers tired, or terrible?	Tired legs. Injuries. A historically poor effort in a game.This isn't the way the Lakers wanted to start exhibition play, but it's as real as the championship trophies in a southeast window ledge overlooking their practice court.Great franchises aren't always good, and the Lakers are teetering, based on, pick any or all, their medical reports, rapidly increasing age, two exhibition blowouts, eye-popping lack of athleticism and/or misfiring rookies.With Steve Nash asking out of Sunday's game, the attention only intensified on what the team planned to do with him over the next six months. He will sit out about one-fourth of their 82 games throughout the regular season, approximately one a week, to help manage chronic nerve damage in his back, according to a person familiar with the situation.Nash, 40, played only 15 games last season and could not finish the Lakers' 116-75 loss to Golden State on Sunday, their second-biggest preseason defeat since they started tracking exhibition scores and stats in 1982."He just didn't feel himself. He didn't say what it was particularly," Lakers Coach Byron Scott said Monday. "Being that he's been in this league for that long, and he understands his body a whole better than I do, I take that for what it's worth and sit him down the rest of the game."Nash did not talk to reporters after Sunday's game or Monday.After the remarkably one-sided exhibition, Kobe Bryant said the team was short on its shots and heavy in its legs because of the tough practices conducted by Scott in his first training camp with the Lakers. Bryant said things would improve when practices started "tapering down" soon.Scott smiled and nodded when asked about it Monday."The one thing that I wanted to do against Golden State that last game, we had a good, hard practice that morning and then we had to play against a very good basketball team. So mentally it's a challenge. And also physically it was a challenge," Scott said."I think the guys are starting to understand that about a week from here, they'll start feeling so much better about their legs and they'll be in so much better shape. Even though it sounds sometimes a little madness, running them the way we run them, but it's all for the betterment of the team and for the end of the season where they'll still be fresh."Bryant seemed fine Monday and gave a brief comment, saying, "He gave us a chill day" while walking out of the training facility with a laptop in his hands and headphones around his neck.The Lakers didn't look fresh or chill against Golden State, outscored at the three-point line, 39-0, and somehow surrendering two four-point plays in the first quarter.Neither Nash nor Bryant practiced Monday. Same for point guards Jeremy Lin (sprained ankle) and Jordan Clarkson (strained calf). With Nash's status unknown for Thursday's exhibition, Clarkson definitely out and Lin only a 50-50 shot, fourth-stringer Ronnie Price might start against Utah.It would be more appealing to see Clarkson, a second-round draft pick, but he's not physically ready to return and made only five of 20 shots in the first two exhibitions.And the Lakers continued to tamp down expectations on their other rookie, power forward Julius Randle, the seventh overall pick."I thought his two games against Golden State, he just looks lost," Scott said. "So he's got to get to the point where he understands the offense a lot better, is not chasing the ball, and defensively he's got to use that size and that quickness and that's something that he hasn't done yet."He's still learning and he's got two weeks to kind of catch up on all those things because I at least want to be able to trust him when I put him in the game."Randle is shooting 39.3% and averaging 8.7 points in three exhibition games. The Lakers' season opener is Oct. 28 against Houston.At the very least, there's always comic relief from Nick Young, who said with a cast on his right hand, "It's too early to panic. It's only preseason."He then proclaimed he would take eight three-point shots a game, and make five of them, when he was ready to return from a torn thumb ligament next month."So you've got to calculate that into the game too," he said.Etc.Ed Davis will get the chance to impress Scott with extended playing time against Utah. "He's the guy that's done the best job at protecting the rim for us," Scott said. A free-agent pickup, Davis has limited skills on offense but could edge out Robert Sacre and become the backup center to Jordan Hill. . . . Ryan Kelly (strained hamstring) practiced Monday but was not expected to play Thursday. Xavier Henry (back spasms) also won't play against Utah.mike.bresnahan@latimes.comTwitter: @Mike_Bresnahan

http://nypost.com/2014/10/13/dan-snyder-literally-foaming-at-the-mouth-over-sloppy-redskins/	Dan Snyder literally foaming at the mouth over sloppy Redskins	The Redskins are headed for another lost season, and Dan Snyder reportedly isn’t handling it well.With Washington headed to its fourth consecutive defeat, a 30-20 loss at Arizona, the Cardinals’ radio crew reported Snyder spat on the floor of University of Phoenix Stadium in the fourth quarter and he left before the game was even over.Radio broadcaster Bertrand Berry, a former Cardinals player, reported the incident after claiming to have seen it while coming down in the elevator with Snyder. The Redskins owner was upset, Berry said, about a Washington fumble not being overturned.Berry also said Snyder left the stadium entirely before the game was over, a claim that was disputed by the Redskins’ local TV crew.Whether Snyder misbehaved or not, he has reason to be spitting mad about his team, which is a total mess at 1-5 and seemingly headed for a season as bad or worse under new coach Jay Gruden as the 3-13 finish that got Mike Shanahan fired in 2013.It’s difficult to find something on the Redskins other than wide receiver DeSean Jackson that’s functioning at an NFL level. The defense is a disaster, having allowed 27 or more points in each of its past four games, and the special teams are as bad as ever.Not even running back Alfred Morris can be relied upon to produce. Morris has been one of the league’s better backs in his short career but has yet to enjoy a 100-yard rushing day this season.The biggest problem, though, is at quarterback, where the buzz about Kirk Cousins before Robert Griffin III’s injury last month now looks completely unwarranted.Cousins threw three interceptions in the fourth quarter Sunday, by far the biggest factor in the loss after the Redskins had closed to within 17-13 late in the third period. Cousins has now thrown eight interceptions in just four games since taking over for Griffin. It’s so bad, some are even calling for Colt McCoy.There is talk Griffin could return from his ankle injury as soon as Nov. 16 against the Buccaneers (the game immediately after the Redskins’ bye week), but at this point, he probably shouldn’t bother rushing back. Washington is 0-2 in the NFC East and four games out in the division race.“We’re not doing anything,” Gruden said Sunday. “This is a broken record every time I stand up here. Unfortunately, it’s on us as coaches. If we have to continue saying the same thing, we’re not obviously getting it across to our players.”At least the Redskins can look forward to a high pick in the draft next spring. Unless, of course, Snyder trades it again like he did their first-rounders in 2013 and 2014 in the Griffin trade.
http://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/lewy-body-dementia-%E2%80%98key-factor%E2%80%99-in-robin-williams-death-report/ar-AA7Avfi	Lewy Body Dementia ‘Key Factor’ In Robin Williams' Death: Report	© Provided by IBT US Robin Williams tribute at emmy awardsRobin Williams was suffering from “Lewy Body Dementia,” a neurodegenerative disease, which led to the 63-year-old comedian’s suicide, TMZ reported Tuesday, citing sources close to his family. The legendary entertainer was found dead on Aug. 11 at his home in northern California.The report stated that Williams was struggling with the disease, which was the “key factor” that led to his untimely death. "Lewy Body Dementia" is a type of dementia closely linked with Parkinson’s disease. The disease reportedly disrupts the normal functioning of the human brain with deposits of abnormal proteins. Sources reportedly said that Williams' doctors had agreed that "Lewy Body Dementia" was a factor leading to his suicide."The central features of DLB include progressive cognitive decline, 'fluctuations' in alertness and attention, visual hallucinations, and parkinsonian motor symptoms, such as slowness of movement, difficulty walking, or rigidity," according to a definition of "dementia with Lewy bodies" from the National Institutes of Health."People may also suffer from depression.  The symptoms of DLB are caused by the build-up of Lewy bodies – accumulated bits of alpha-synuclein protein — inside the nuclei of neurons in areas of the brain that control particular aspects of memory and motor control."According to TMZ, people suffering from the disease are prone to side effects from the medication, while some also show signs of hallucination. Williams’ wife, Susan Schneider, reportedly told authorities that the “Mrs. Doubtfire” actor had been complaining about the medication he had been receiving.An autopsy report released last week from the coroner in Marin County, California, ruled out the involvement of drugs and alcohol in his death.In August, Schneider revealed in a statement that Williams had been struggling with depression and anxiety associated with the early stages of Parkinson’s disease. She added that he seemed to have been experiencing “a recent increase in paranoia.”The coroner’s report said that Williams’ body was found by his assistant who entered the actor's locked room when he didn’t answer the door.
http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1115456-missing-plane-found-malaysia-airlines-flight-370-likely-in-one-piece-pilot-says/	Missing Plane Update: Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 Likely in One Piece, Pilot Says	Missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is likely still in one piece and located approximately 4 miles beneath the surface ocean, claims a Boeing pilot in an editorial on Sunday.Byron Bailey, who flew B777 planes–the same type as Flight 370–attempted to debunk theories about the passenger jet’s disappearance in March. He writes that the plane is “so automated that if something happened to the Flight Crew, or even if they left the cockpit shortly after takeoff,” the plane is able to hit its destination with a “preprogrammed computer Flight Profile.”He notes that if the plane crashed, there would be debris floating around, which hasn’t been the case for Flight 370.Writes Bailey for the Daily Telegraph, “I am bemused by the media coverage given to self proclaimed experts — people who have never flown a modern fly-by-wire computerised glass cockpit airliner and yet offer speculation as to what happened to MH370.”Bailey also adds that the plane–which is said to have crashed in the southern Indian Ocean–will be discovered eventually. “B777 is a very large aircraft and I personally believe that MH370 is intact and in 6000m (about 3.7 miles) of water. If we search long enough it will be found,” he writes.“The ‘experts’ also stated that the aircraft might have flown slower and therefore flown further – hence more guessing as to the extent of the search area,” he adds, according to the Telegraph. He said those claims are “rubbish.”Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 Conspiracy? Top Airline Official Says Gov’t Holding InformationThis map shows the Malaysia Airlines Flight MH 370 search area. Over 6,900 square kilometres of the seafloor have been searched so far. (atsb.gov.au)“For it to alter course and fly a different route as alleged would require the deliberate manual intervention of someone with considerable expertise of FMS protocols, which suggests a preplanned intention.”Meanwhile, Australian officials are currently trying to figure out if and where debris from Flight 370, which disappeared March 8 with 239 people on board, could wash ashore. There was initial speculation that the plane’s debris would wash up on the shores of Indonesia’s Western Sumatra four months after it disappeared.“We are currently working … to see if we can get an updated drift model for a much wider area where there might be possibilities of debris washing ashore,” search coordinator Peter Foley said, reported Reuters.In this March 18, 2014 photo, a young Malaysian boy prays, at an event for the missing Malaysia Airline Flight 370. (AP Photo/Joshua Paul, File)And Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) Chief Commissioner Martin Dolan has also dismissed suggestions there was a disagreement among five groups involved in the Flight 370 investigation that led to delays in the search.“There is no disagreement, just the deliberate application of differing analysis models,” Dolan said.Nearly 7,000 square kilometers have been searched for far, the ATSB said in a recent update.The groups agreed that the final resting spot for Flight 370 is in the “7th arc” that stretches about 1,000 kilometers from Exmouth, Western Australia.NEXT PAGE: See What Recent Malaysia Airlines Tweet Offended Many
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eat-the-press/2007/02/06/josh-wolf-pioneering-jou_e_40288.html	Eat The Press | Josh Wolf: Pioneering Journalist And Symptom Of Something Very, Very Wrong	from joshwolf.netRachel Sklar |  Posted Tuesday February 6, 2007 at 09:43 AMLast Tuesday, U.S. District Judge William Alsup refused to release freelance videographer Josh Wolf from jail, where he has been for 169 days since being imprisoned for refusing to turn over raw footage to a grand jury. Today, he becomes the longest-running imprisoned journalist in U.S. history.Wolf, 24, was held in contempt of court in August 2006 for refusing to comply with a subpoena demanding the raw footage from aJuly 2005 protest in which a police officer was injured and allegations of vandalism of police property were made. Wolf's imprisonment for contempt, if uninterrupted, will run until the expiration of the Grand Jury in July 2007 — even though all the underlying criminal charges relating to the incident have been dropped.Wolf's motion requesting a new hearing was made last week on the argument that the jail term was obviously not going to change his mind and had now crossed over into the realm of criminal punishment in a case where, at this point, there wasn't even a potential criminal. Like that mattered. From the SF Chronicle:Alsup denied release in a one-paragraph decision, citing a prosecutor's statement that Martin Garbus, Wolf's lawyer, had offered to turn over the tape in exchange for a promise that Wolf would not have to identify anyone who appeared on it. "This reveals a realistic possibility that Mr. Wolf's confinement may be having its coercive effect,'' the judge said.The Chronicle reported that Garbus had actually suggested that as a possibility to bring to Wolf (i.e. no, his frame of mind has not changed), but actually, various compromise offers had earlier been made by the Wolf team thus far, offering the tape without Wolf's testimony; it's the Court that is refusing to budge. (Wolf has also told the court that the specific incident of vandalism alleged — the attempt to set fire to a police car — was not on the tape). In November, Wolf was denied bail.Note that Wolf 's case has come before a Federal court rather than a state court, before which he would be protected by California's shield law (there is no federal shield law for journalists, as we learned during the case of Judy Miller). Note also that the burden of proving that the investigation is frivolous or in bad faith in this case has been put on Wolf — a difficult and onerous burden, and the reverse of what is usually required where the deprivation of liberty is concerned (though you would think that pointing out that the event in question was not even on the tape would factor somewhat into the assessment). So torecap: A 24-year old videoblogger refuses to turn over footage that is probably not relevant in a case where there are no criminal charges, to be held until the second the grand jury compelling him expires, just in case he changes his mind. After that, after almost a year in prison, the longest-running imprisoned American journalist will be allowed to go home. It's so great when justice is served.Imprisoned Vid-Blogger Josh Wolf Denied Request For Hearing, Bail [ETP]
http://www.examiner.com/article/ufo-discovered-collecting-energy-of-sun-on-nasa-live-feed	UFO discovered collecting energy of sun on NASA live feed	Play Although it's safe to say that some video editing was involved in the making of this clip, you have to admit that the footage itself is still impressive! An apparent "UFO" flying with military aircraft over Blend, USA. Check it out! on.aol.comOver a four day period up to November 9, NASA’s Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) detected a strange area near the sun where solar activity was apparently being deflected or absorbed by an invisible object. According to two independent solar researchers in videos uploaded to Youtube on November 9 (see here and here), the affected area was due to a giant shield created by a UFO to protect itself from the sun’s energy. An alternative explanation is that the immense spherical lens shaped field was part of an advanced technology based on the principle of a “Dyson Sphere.” NASA’s SOHO images appear to be evidence of the sun’s energy being absorbed by a gigantic lens shaped solar collector whose approximate size is a mind staggering five times the sun’s diameter!Michael SallaThe solar images used to identify the alleged “UFO shield”or solar collector can be publicly downloaded from SOHO’s Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO). Video data from the LASCO C2 (orange) and C3 (blue) reveals that from November 6-9, an area to the lower right of the sun appears to not have any solar activity while areas around the rest of the sun do so. Either the sun’s energy is being deflected back from the region by a “UFO shield” or absorbed by a giant lens of tremendous size – dwarfing the sun in comparison. The sheer size of the affected area, suggests that the hemispheric object was designed to absorb solar energy towards, rather than deflecting it away from, a UFO at the center of the hemisphere. A close inspection of the LASCO C2 (orange) film footage, in particular, suggests the sun’s activity is actually being absorbed, rather than deflected, by a giant hemispheric lens of some kind.The idea of an invisible giant hemispheric shaped solar collector is consistent with the development of a new generation of solar panel collectors that are spherical in design and use glass. One of these is called the “Rawlemon Spherical Solar Energy Generator” which is described as follows:… the Rawlemon design uses a spherical lens to concentrate sunlight on a small photovoltaic panel and combines this with a dual-axis pivot that tracks the movement of the sun. According to the designer the transparent sphere is able collect and concentrate diffuse where traditional devices cannot and as well as providing an efficiency boost, they can be used in far more locations than their flat, fixed counterparts. It's also claimed that by concentrating the sun’s light in one area, the Rawlemon design reduces the solar cell surface required to just 1 percent of that required by a traditional panel.Could something similar to the “Rawlemon Generator” be designed on a much larger scale for collecting solar energy by an advanced extraterrestrial civilization?According to Freeman Dyson, a celebrated astrophysicist, a Type II extraterrestrial civilization would have the advanced technology to harness solar activity on a grand scale. A Dyson sphere, for example, could be constructed around a sun to collect solar energy in ways similar to how humanity harnesses hydro power, through water channels and dams. While a Dyson Sphere is theorized to be big enough to encircle a sun, similar principles could be used for a giant “Rawlemon Generator” type solar collector where a spherical glass lens could be pointed towards a sun. This can be best described as a “Dyson Lens.”In an earlier live NASA streaming incident from August 2014 involving the STEREO A satellite, a UFO with an apparent spherical lens trailing behind it, is moving past the orbit of Venus. The UFO appears to be using the lens, which is approximately four times the diameter of Venus, to absorb the sun’s energy over a six day period from August 3 – 9. The August incident provides stunning video evidence of what appears to be a “Dyson Lens” being used by a UFO belonging to a Type II extraterrestrial civilization. It supports the evidence that the object captured by SOHO over the August 6-9 period is in fact a highly advanced solar collector as much as five times the sun’s diameter.Over the last decade, live streaming from NASA and other national space agencies has provided remarkable evidence that we are not alone in the universe. UFOs have been regularly photographed and filmed in close proximity to the International Space Station, Moon, Mars and other celestial bodies, Rarely, however, has live streaming video captured evidence that answers the question, how advanced is the technology used by UFOs? Do we now have compelling data to answer this question?

http://www.voanews.com/content/berlin-wall-commemoration-events-under-way/2513605.html	Germans Mark 25 Years Since Fall of Berlin Wall	Germans are celebrating the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall.German Chancellor Angela Merkel led several events Sunday, including the placing of a rose in one of the few remaining sections of the Wall  to commemorate the 138 people killed in Berlin alone as they tried to flee the Soviet-allied state.In a speech at the main memorial site for the Wall, Merkel said that "the fall of the Wall has shown us that dreams can come true."She called the Wall a "symbol of state abuse cast in concrete" that "took millions of people to the limits of what is tolerable."Relevance to other countriesBut Merkel said the fall of the Berlin Wall also holds relevance in the war-torn countries of today, including Ukraine, Syria and Iraq."It showed that we have the power to shape our destiny and make things better. That is the message of the fall of the Wall," she said. "It is directed at us in Germany, but also at others in Europe and the world, especially to people in Ukraine, in Syria, Iraq and other regions where human rights are threatened or violated."It was a victory of freedom over bondage and it's a message of faith for today's, and future, generations that can tear down the walls - the walls of dictators, violence and ideologies," said Merkel, who is now 60 and has led united Germany since 2005.Merkel, a young scientist in Communist East Berlin when she got her first taste of freedom on Nov. 9, 1989, said in a speech that the Wall's opening in response to mass popular pressure would be eternally remembered as a triumph of the human spirit.Merkel, in an unusually emotional speech, said the lesson of November 9, 1989 was that "we can change things for the better - that is the message of the fall of the Berlin Wall."Merkel recalled that November 9 is also the anniversary of Nazi Germany's 1938 anti-Jewish "Kristallnacht" pogroms that marked the start of the Holocaust, "a day of shame and disgrace.""How could that date ever become a day of happiness and joy?" she asked.Thanks 'glasnost,' 'perestroika'Merkel thanked those abroad who paved the way for the historic events, from the Czech and Polish pro-democracy movements to Moscow's "glasnost" and "perestroika" reforms, saying that in 1989 "the Iron Curtain had already been torn.""We Germans will never forget that the freedom and democracy movements in central and eastern Europe paved the way for the happiest moment in our recent history," she said.Merkel was speaking at the Berlin Wall Memorial, which features a 220-meter (720-foot) section of what was once a 155-kilometer (100-mile) concrete cordon encircling West Berlin."We have every reason to celebrate," said Mayor Klaus Wowereit, whose city government has been rebuilding small segments of the Wall for posterity and tourists after almost all of the original concrete barrier was hastily torn down over two decades ago."We were all happy at the time that it had fallen and (so it) was torn down," Wowereit said.However, current and former world leaders warned of continued divisions among major powers that threaten a new Cold War.U.S. President Barack Obama issued a statement on Saturday saying Russia's actions against Ukraine are a reminder that there is "more work to do" for Europe to be "whole, free and at peace."The Berlin Wall divided the German capital and came to define the Cold War, which pitted the United States and its allies against the Soviet Union following World War Two.Gorbachev: Brink of 'new Cold War'Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev said Saturday that the world is on the brink of " new Cold War" and that some say it has already begun.At an event commemorating the Berlin Wall anniversary, Gorbachev said,  "Bloodshed in Europe and the Middle East against the backdrop of a breakdown in dialogue between major powers is of enormous concern."The West and Russia have been mired in tensions over Ukraine for months.Built in 1961, the Berlin Wall divided the city for nearly three decades. It separated Communist East Germany from West Germany.It began as a brick wall and was then fortified as a heavily guarded 160-kilometer (100-mile), double concrete screen that encircled West Berlin, slicing across streets, between families and through graveyards.Nearly 140 people are said to have died trying to cross the wall from communist East Berlin, but victims' groups say the number is closer to 700.Wall protestsMerkel on Sunday praised the courageous citizens who peacefully brought down the Berlin Wall 25 years ago.It was November 9, 1989, when East Germany's government ended its restrictions on travel into West Berlin after weeks of public protests that began in the eastern city of Leipzig and spread to East Berlin.Jubilant crowds immediately gathered at the wall, climbing it and crossing through the gates, hammering and chiseling away pieces of it and joining in celebration with West Berliners on the other side. Not one shot was fired.The opening of the border was a critical moment in the collapse of communism.Just two years earlier, then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan had delivered a speech in Berlin in which he challenged Gorbachev to "tear down this wall."East and West Germany reunited on October 3, 1990.German authorities said the emphasis of the anniversary this year is on celebrating a unified Germany.An art project, "Lichtgrenze 2014" (lit. "lightborder 2014") at the Wall Park in Berlin, features 8,000 luminous white balloons meant to illustrate how the Wall cut through the heart of Berlin. The balloons were set free on Sunday evening - symbolically reenacting the Wall's collapse.Some material for this report came from Reuters and AFP.

(Hint: It's Not Verizon)	Let's be honest, most wireless carriers aren't adored by their customers. But if we look at some of the data on Sprint (NYSE: S  ) it appears the company has the most unhappy customers in the wireless industry. Based on the rate at which customers leave the company and two independent surveys, the nation's third-largest carrier is struggling to please its customers.Churn rates don't lie Let's start with the wireless industry's plum line for how well a carrier holds on to its customers -- churn rate. Churn is the percentage of customers that leave a carrier for another network. In Sprint's most recent quarter the company had a postpaid churn rate of 2.18% -- the highest of all major US carriers.In the company's fiscal Q2 2014 earnings release this week, Sprint said it lost 272,000 postpaid subscribers in the quarter. Net tablet additions hid some of the worst news that a whopping 500,000 phone subscribers left in the three month period. That's terrible news for Sprint and its investors.By comparison Verizon had a churn rate of 1.00%, AT&T's (NYSE: T  ) was 0.99% and T-Mobile's (NYSE: TMUS  ) was 1.6% in each of their most recent quarters.Of course there are a few factors that play into churn rates other than a customer being dissatisfied with a carrier, but on the whole the lower the churn rate the better the indicator customers are happy with their current wireless provider.But let's assume for a minute that Sprint has a higher churn rate than its competitors for some reason other than customer dissatisfaction. Well, then we could look to other sources for whether or not Sprint's customers are truly unhappy.The list no company wants to be on A recent survey commissioned Zogby Analytics for 24/7 Wall Street showed that Sprint topped a list for one of the worst customer service companies. More than one in five survey respondents said Sprint's service was "poor."This comes as Sprint was fined $7.5 million by the FCC earlier this year for violating "do-not-call" requests by its customers. To be fair, Sprint's not the only one. AT&T is paying $105 million to settle FTC charges that it added unauthorized charges onto its customers' phone bills.But even before this survey came out, Sprint's been known for its lackluster reputation among the public.An ongoing problem Last year Consumer Reports published a survey showing that Sprint was in dead last place among cell phone carriers, according to the publications' readers. While the Consumer Reports took into account factors like voice calls and data, the most telling indicators came from Sprint's customer support.For "ease and speed of getting through phone system to appropriate support staff" Sprint received Consumer Reports' worse-than-average rating, as did the company's rating for how well customer issues were resolved. The highest rating Sprint got was "average" for how knowledgeable the company's staff was. Not exactly a stellar report card.This is isn't helping things either According to data from RootMetrics, in the first six months of this year Sprint had the worst performing network of all the major wireless carriers.Source: RootMetrics.Sprint trailed the pack in network speed, call performance, and data performance, while barely beating T-Mobile for reliability and text performance.Fortunately, Sprint's in the process of updating its old 3G network with 4G LTE and is bringing its ultrafast tri-band Spark network to more cities. On top of that, Sprint just replaced its former CEO with billionaire Marcelo Claure, the founder of the wireless distribution services company, Brightstar. With a new network and a new leader, RootMetrics thinks Sprint's last place finish could be short-lived.While Sprint's clearly making changes to reverse its place among competitors, the company needs to focus on its industry high churn rate. Competition among wireless carriers is stronger than ever, and with T-Mobile's aggressive offers and superior network, there are some clear benefits for Sprint customers to switch to the "uncarrier" network.I think Sprint has a long road ahead of it in changing its place in the wireless industry. The company could stand to take a few pages of out T-Mobile's branding book. Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure reportedly asked his vice presidents "Why would anybody want to buy a Sprint phone?" after he took over the job -- and they had no answer. If that's the case, it's no wonder why Sprint customers are likely asking themselves the same thing.$19 trillion industry could destroy the Internet One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World-Wide-Web to bed. And if you act right away, it could make you wildly rich. Experts are calling it the single largest business opportunity in the history of capitalism...

http://www.aol.com/article/2014/07/18/rebel-leader-gives-bizarre-account-of-plane-crash/20933592/	Rebel leader gives bizarre account of plane crash	MOSCOW (AP) -- A top pro-Russia rebel commander in eastern Ukraine has given a bizarre version of events surrounding the Malaysian jetliner crash - suggesting many of the victims may have died days before the plane took off.The pro-rebel website Russkaya Vesna on Friday quoted Igor Girkin as saying he was told by people at the crash site that "a significant number of the bodies weren't fresh," adding that he was told they were drained of blood and reeked of decomposition.The Malaysia Airlines Boeing-777 was shot down Thursday, killing all 298 people aboard. The plane was flying 10,000 meters above an area where Ukrainian forces have been fighting separatist rebels. Each side accuses the other of downing the plane.U.S. intelligence authorities said a surface-to-air missile brought down the plane, and U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power told the U.N. Security Council in New York on Friday that the missile was likely fired from a rebel-held area near the Russian border.Girkin, also known as Strelkov and allegedly a former Russian military intelligence agent, said he couldn't confirm the information. But it's sure to add to the intense emotions surrounding the crash, with the rebels accused of shooting down the plane.Girkin said "Ukrainian authorities are capable of any baseness."He claimed that a large amount of blood serum and medications were found in the wreckage.

http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/11/13/china_us_preparing_for_war_handshake_deal_pla_military_pentagon	China and the United States Are Preparing for War	At a Nov. 12 news conference in Beijing, General Secretary of the Communist Party Xi Jinping and U.S. President Barack Obama agreed to notify the other side before major military activities, and to develop a set of rules of behavior for sea and air encounters, in order to avoid military confrontations in Asia. "It’s incredibly important that we avoid inadvertent escalation," Ben Rhodes, a U.S. deputy national security advisor, was quoted by the Wall Street Journal as saying. An "accidental circumstance," he said, could "lead into something that could precipitate conflict."Should we really be worried about war between the United States and China? Yes. Over the last four decades of studying China, I have spoken with hundreds of members of China’s military, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), and read countless Chinese military journals and strategy articles. Chinese military and political leaders believe that their country is at the center of American war planning. In other words, Beijing believes that the United States is readying itself for the possibility of a conflict with China — and that it must prepare for that eventuality.Tensions are high not just because of Beijing’s rapidly expanding military budget, or because the United States continues to commit an increasingly high percentage of its military assets to the Pacific as part of its "rebalance" strategy. Rather, the biggest problem is Chinese opacity. While it’s heartening to hear Xi agree to instruct the PLA to be more open with regard to the United States, it is doubtful this will lead to any real changes. Washington is willing to share a substantial amount of military information with China, in order to "reduce the chances of miscommunication, misunderstanding or miscalculation," as then U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said during a January 2011 trip to Beijing. But the Chinese leadership, which benefits from obfuscation and asymmetric tactics, refuses to communicate its military’s intentions.Despite repeated entreaties from American officials, Beijing is unwilling to talk about many key military issues — like the scope and intentions of its rapid force buildup, development of technologies that could cripple American naval forces in the region, and its military’s involvement in cyberattacks against the United States — that would lower friction between the two sides. And sometimes, as in 2010 after U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, Beijing breaks off military-to-military contacts altogether — leading to an especially troubling silence.As a result, there is a growing mistrust of China among many thoughtful people in the U.S. government. Chinese military officers have complained to me that journals of the American war colleges now feature articles on war with China, and how the United States can win. A February 2014 article, for example, in the U.S. Naval Institute’s Proceedings magazine, entitled "Deterring the Dragon," proposes laying offensive underwater mines along China’s coast to close China’s main ports and destroy its sea lines of communications. The article also suggests sending special operations forces to arm China’s restive minorities in the country’s vast western regions. But China is doing the same thing. In 2013, Gen. Peng Guangqian and Gen. Yao Youzhi updated their now-classic text, The Science of Military Strategy, and called for Beijing to add to the quality and quantity of its nuclear weapons, in order to close the gap between China and both Russia and the United States. Even Xi’s "new model" of great-power relations seems to preclude arms control negotiations, requiring the United States to yield to the inevitability of China’s rise.Many people outside the Pentagon may be surprised by just how many senior American officials are worried about a war with China. These include no less than the last U.S. two secretaries of defense, and a former secretary of state. In the concluding chapter of Henry Kissinger’s 2011 book, On China, he warns of a World War I-style massive Chinese-American war. "Does history repeat itself?" he asks.Over at least the last decade, on several occasions the United States has pressed China to be more forthright about its military intentions and capabilities. In April 2006, after a meeting between President George W. Bush, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and Chinese President Hu Jintao, both governments announced the start of talks between the strategic nuclear force commanders on both sides. This move would have been extremely important in demonstrating openness about military intentions. But the PLA dragged its feet, and the talks never started. In a September 2012 trip to Beijing, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta tried to persuade Beijing to enter military talks. Like his predecessor Gates, Panetta called for four specific areas of strategic dialogue: nuclear weapons, missile defense, outer space, and cybersecurity. But the Chinese objected, and again the talks never happened. Sure, Beijing could follow through on the agreements announced during Obama’s recent trip. But I’m skeptical. One of the biggest advantages China has over the United States is the asymmetry of military knowledge. Why would they give that up?

http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/personal/2014/08/05/russian-gang-stolen-passwords/13639285/	Russian gang stole 1.2 billion Net passwords	LAS VEGAS -- Security researchers say a Russian crime ring has pulled off the largest known theft of confidential Internet information, including 1.2 billion username and password combinations and more than 500 million email addresses.The cyber gang injected malicious code to steal databases from at least 420,000 websites, says Alex Holden, founder and chief information security officer for Hold Security in Milwaukee, Wisc."It is absolutely the largest breach we've ever encountered," Holden said late Tuesday.Most unsettling, he said, was finding his own credentials among the compromised data.Hold Security cyber sleuths have been monitoring the cyber gang for about seven months, but only recently realized the magnitude of the gang's operation, Holden said."We thought at first they were run-of-the-mill spammers," he said. "But they got very good at stealing these databases."Holden won't identify the gang, but he says his investigators know their names and locations. "The perpetrators are in Russia so not much can be done. These people are outside the law," he said.Hold Security said it is trying to contact the victims, but most of the websites remain vulnerable. Holden would not identify the victims, but said they included the auto industry, real estate, oil companies, consulting firms, car rental businesses, hotels, computer hardware and software firms and the food industry. The gang targeted SQL databases, Holden said.The New York Times first reported the breach Tuesday.Word comes as hundreds of the world's computer security professionals gather here for Black Hat, a major computer-security conference.While the breach appears to be large, it's still hard to say if it's the biggest that's ever been discovered, said Marc Maiffret, the chief technical officer at BeyondTrust, a Phoenix-based computer security company. "There's always lots of changes when the dust settles, it takes months to know" how important a breach was, he said.If a cache of passwords this big has been found, others likely exist. "I would absolutely assume there are others," said Maiffret.The cache of credentials was created by taking advantage of the two most common types of hacking — attacking web sites to gain access to underlying databases of customer information, as well as going after individuals and "everyday email," said Maiffret. "It's really a perfect storm" of an attack, he said.The size of the operation shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone, Maiffret said. "In the past, when people thought of hacking, they thought of a lone teen-aged hacker sitting in the basement," he said. "But people need to realize that most hacking today is related to organized crime."Even large companies need to acknowledge that modern-day hackers are likely "much better funded than they are," said security expert Sharon Vardi, who is the chief marketing officer of Securonix. "They are backed by millions of dollars to get the job done," he said.Describing the breach as "easily five times the size of the Target breach," Vardi said that most organizations are not set up to defend these types of attacks. "They are not monitoring anomalies in their networks to detect these breaches quickly," he said.Security expert Phil Lieberman, CEO of Lieberman Software, thinks the theft may be more of a warning or a veiled threat from the Russians. "I think this is a political statement rather than a security threat," he said. "I think there is a message being sent and the message is: Watch out."The Russian government could have prevented the breach, he says. "But then the question is: Why should they? Are we such good friends that they should stop this?"Leinwand Leger reported from McLean, Va.; Guynn reported from San Francisco.Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1npYD5Z

http://news.yahoo.com/19-old-fighter-kobani-buried-turkey-075011212.html	19-year-old fighter from Kobani buried in Turkey	SURUC, Turkey (AP) — It was an easy decision to make. Barely out of school, Perwin Mustafa Dihap wanted to follow in the footsteps of three of her older siblings and go to war. Before long, she was on the front line in the Kurdish Syrian city of Kobani, her hometown on the Turkish border besieged on three sides by extremists from the Islamic State group.Just two months later, the 19-year-old lay dying in a hospital across the border in Turkey, wounded in an Oct. 6 mortar attack on her position in the city.The doctor told her family the young woman's chances were slim, despite her surviving a five-hour operation. Yet Dihap still held out hope."We went to the hospital ... and I asked her how she was doing, and she said: 'Don't worry about me. If I get better, I will go back to fight again,'" said her 34-year-old brother, Kemal Mustafa Dihap.But she didn't get better. As her condition deteriorated, doctors transferred her to two other hospitals in larger Turkish towns in an effort to save her. In the last two days, she was too weak to speak. Dihap died in the early hours of Nov. 5."Even though she was really young, she was really brave and strong," her brother said, swallowing hard to keep his emotions in check as he stood outside the morgue in the Turkish border town of Suruc.View gallery Mourners flash victory signs during the funeral of 19 year-old Syrian Kurdish female fighter Perwin  …He, his mother and his siblings waited to accompany his little sister's coffin to the nearby cemetery where many of the Kurds who die fighting in Kobani are being buried. The framed photographs they carried showed a fresh-faced young woman in uniform, a wisp of her brown hair crossing her forehead, the ghost of a smile on her lips.Dihap, the youngest of originally 12 children, was buried alongside Emina Mahmoud, believed to be 22, during a joint funeral. Like many Kurds killed in Kobani, Mahmoud's family had not been traced in time for the ceremony.The two were among hundreds of women fighting in the Women's Protection Units, or YPJ. Kurdish women have fought alongside men for decades in a guerrilla war seeking an independent Kurdistan that would encompass parts of Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran.After six months of basic training, Dihap was initially assigned to the police force, said her mother, Fatma Isa Dihap. But the girl insisted she wanted to be in the thick of battle. Their town had come under an intense assault by IS fighters in mid-September, with the extremists taking over parts of the city in fierce battles with Kurdish fighters. A U.S.-led coalition is now carrying out airstrikes against IS positions in and around Kobani.About 200,000 people have fled into neighboring Turkey, which borders the north side of Kobani.View gallery A mourner flashes a victory sign while crying during the funeral of 19 year-old Syrian Kurdish fight …It was Dihap's mother who took her to join up. Two of her other children were already fighters: a son in the battle for Kobani and a daughter fighting in the Syrian region of Afrin, near Aleppo."I took her to the comrades and told them: 'I present my daughter to Kurdistan,'" she said.It was a sacrifice she was prepared to bear despite already having buried three of her children, explained her son Kemal. One of her sons was killed in 1996 fighting in the Kurdish guerrilla war, another was killed in a car crash and a third accidentally drowned."I am happy and I am proud of my daughter; she is the martyr of Kurdistan and Kobani," said Dihap as she prepared to bury her youngest child.Cheering defiantly and ululating for her daughter outside the morgue and at the cemetery, the mother finally broke down when the coffin arrived at the gravesite.View gallery A Kurdish girl cries during the funeral of 19 year-old Syrian Kurdish fighter girl Perwin Mustafa Di …"Perwin!" she cried, as her daughter's shrouded body was lifted out of her wooden coffin and placed in her grave.____Mohammed Rasool in Suruc, Turkey, contributed.____Follow Becatoros on Twitter at https://twitter.com/ElenaBec

Or however you want to describe her amazing marriage to David Foster.And today those little hearts with musical note wings are in over-drive because it’s YoDa’s anniversary. CLICK THE CONTINUE READING BUTTON FOR PHOTOS! Yes, I officially dub them YoDa, because Yolanda thinks she is the authority and exemplary example of everything and dispenses advice as if she was a soda machine.

Instagram Photo Reveals ‘Skeletal’ Frame	Could actress Jessica Alba be too skinny?The 33-year-old actress recently enjoyed a vacation in Thailand with her best friend.Jessica posted a picture of herself and her friend jumping in the air on her official Instagram page Friday, showing just how much fun they were having in such a beautiful location.“Jump for joy! #Thailand w my #BFF”Even though it is a great picture with a beautiful background shot, it has also generated a lot of negative reactions in reference to Jessica Alba’s appearance.Radar Online used the word “skeletal” in their detailed description of Jessica Alba’s body, which was published on Saturday.“The gorgeous setting couldn’t distract from the fact that Alba’s ribs were protruding and her arms seemed skeletal.”Back in July, the mother of two opened up about her diet to Self magazine – stating that she actually follows the same diet regimen that she provides for her two daughters.“I have the same food philosophy for myself as I do for my kids. We eat mostly lean protein and fresh fruit and vegetables, nothing processed or from a box, if we can. For me, when I don’t eat a ton of carbs, I have more energy.”However, Jessica Alba also admitted that she still has her moments when she strays away from the strict diet plan.“I’ll for sure have a piece of chocolate. I will mow through a bowl of guacamole. If I’m not going to have dessert, I’ll have a martini.”When it comes to her workout regimen, the Machete Kills actress stated in her interview with Self magazine that her physically demanding movie roles required her to stay in great shape for ten years – between the ages of 17 and 27.Even though she admittedly hates working out because “it’s boring,” Jessica Alba does not take her fitness lightly. While she might skimp on her diet for an occasional cheat snack or beverage, one of her fitness trainers (Jennifer Johnson) stated that Jessica definitely does not skimp when it comes to her workouts.“Jess is an animal. She works like crazy. She’s still hungry to make it happen. You know that saying, ‘You have just as many hours in the day as Beyonce?’ It’s the same with Jessica. She just uses those hours better, too.”To say that Jessica Alba has a full plate would be an understatement – especially since she is a mother, wife, author, actress and the co-founder of a multi-million dollar company.However, Jessica Alba has been able to stay in shape and obviously enjoys an active lifestyle. However, do you think that she has become too skinny?[Image Credit: ABC News]
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/11/20/wife-of-ferguson-police-officer-fears-for-her-family-s-safety/20996873/	Wife of Ferguson police officer fears for her family's safety	FERGUSON, MO (KTVI) – Wives and children of many police officers are in virtual hiding, as some face assault and death threats. Fox Files investigator Chris Hayes talked with the wife of a Ferguson officer who said she's not leaving town, because she fears people aren't hearing the whole truth about her husband's department.During the spring of 2014, the City of Ferguson commissioned a study to find out what residents thought about City services, including the Ferguson Police Department. It's data that some fear could be met with threats of violence, at a time when police families are already telling their sons and daughters, "Don't tell anyone you're the child of a police officer."The police wife said, "We don't have answers for them" as she broke down. Then she continued, "It's very frightening. Most people who have a family member who's a police officer are very proud of what they do."She remains proud, in hiding. We protected her identity for her safety. She continued, "This is real and people actually do know how to find us and they do want to harm us."She's received many strange calls, including this message, just before I met her, (Unknown caller) "Would you rather hear me coming out, coming out and robbing your house? And it would be like, it'd just be like silence man, you couldn't hear nothing."She talked about looking over her shoulder, "Did they follow me here? Did I do a good enough job after work today of taking different routes, on my way home. Just letting my younger daughter leave the house ..."She says some families are leaving town. She says she's decided to stay for Ferguson Police officers, but also for Ferguson residents, who ranked the police department as one of the best city services.It's in a survey no one's talked about, headed by a Professor at University of Missouri-St. Louis. It's from May of 2014, before any unrest, when the City of Ferguson wanted to know what residents thought about annexing an area north of 270.Researchers asked registered voters and 61 percent of them said they believed Ferguson was "moving in the right direction." Then citizens ranked city services, putting police third after the fire department and trash service (above six other departments like "code enforcement" and "streets," at the bottom).When you break it down by ward, even the area surrounding Canfield where Michael Brown died, 69% of those residents rated Ferguson Police good or excellent. Only 4% scored Ferguson police as poor.The police wife fears the public is not hearing everything. When people complained about militarization of police, she said it wasn't Ferguson police with the heavy gear. She said, "They didn't have the equipment they needed." Not even helmets, until families pooled their money to buy them. Now she wonders if the Department of Justice also only hears those screaming loudest. She added, "Well, it appears the DOJ made up their mind before they ever got started." She continued, "I'm very worried about what's going to happen to the citizens and what's going to happen to the businesses and what's going to happen to the police officers. This is a good community with a long history and they love their community."Ferguson mayor James Knowles said the Department of Justice is aware of the UMSL study. He said he's open to any help his town can get with reforms. The council has already eliminated the "tow release fee," which we exposed in a recent Fox Files investigation. Ferguson eliminated the fee September 25th. Some towns add a fee of $500.Ferguson Police families continue raising money for police helmets, through an organization called Helmets for Heroes.

The sight turns Lin's perception of homelessness on its head.Lin says he is "stunned" and admits he thought the man might buy alcohol."You just touched my heart," Lin told him.While the gesture left the prankster so emotional that he decided to donate another $100, he also had something to offer Lin:"There's a lot of people that are just victims of circumstance," the homeless man told him. "And they didn't go homeless because they're lazy ...It could be a divorce, and one thing leads to another. A man sells his boat, his home, and all of a sudden he finds out he has no money. There's a lot of good people that are homeless."Update: Taugan Tan Kadalim, a passerby to the scene, told Vocativ that he witnessed some of the filming of the video and that the incident appeared to be staged. Kadalim told the site that Lin and the homeless man arrived at the liquor store in the same car.

http://www.aol.com/article/2014/12/07/survivors-gather-to-remember-pearl-harbor-attack/21004015/	Survivors gather to remember Pearl Harbor attack	PEARL HARBOR, Hawaii (AP) - Many of the veterans who survived the Pearl Harbor attack that launched the United States into World War II attended Sunday's 73rd anniversary ceremony with the help of canes, wheelchairs and motorized scooters.Wearing purple orchid lei, about 100 Pearl Harbor and World War II survivors attended the ceremony overlooking a memorial that sits atop sunken battleship USS Arizona. Many of them arrived well before the sun came up.This year's anniversary is the 10th consecutive one that USS Utah survivor Gilbert Meyer attended. But it's getting harder for Meyer, 91, to travel to Hawaii from San Antonio.Asked if he planned to attend next year's anniversary, he responded with a chuckle, "That's like asking me if I'll still be alive."Harold Johnson, 90, is making it a goal to attend the 75th anniversary, even though traveling from Oak Harbor, Washington, isn't always easy. "I've got a little scooter that's a real life saver," the USS Oklahoma survivor said.Johnson had been aboard the Oklahoma for just six months on Dec. 7, 1941, looking forward to a day off and a "date with a little Hawaiian girl." He was shining his shoes when the first alarm went off, he recalled."Three months later I ran into her in town in Honolulu," he said of his date. "She was mad at me because I stood her up."For many of the roughly 2,000 survivors who remain, there are also more painful memories.Keynote speaker Gen. Lori Robinson, commander of Pacific Air Forces, told the crowd of several thousand about four of the nine remaining survivors of the USS Arizona. Don Stratton, 92, of Colorado Springs, Colorado, and Lauren Bruner, 94, of La Mirada, California, were two of six men who escaped the inferno that engulfed the forward half of the ship by negotiating a line, hand over hand, about 45 feet in the air, despite burns to more than 60 percent of their bodies. John Anderson, 97, of Roswell, New Mexico, was ordered off the ship, but he didn't want to leave behind his twin brother, Delbert. Even though he was forced into a small boat that took him to Ford Island, he commandeered an empty boat and returned to the Arizona to rescue three shipmates. But he never found his brother."When the Arizona sank, she took with her 1,177 sailors and Marines," Robinson told the crowd, which included Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer and Hawaii Gov. David Ige.Robinson also highlighted the sacrifices of the Honolulu Fire Department, which was dispatched to respond after receiving the alarm at 8:05 a.m. "Without knowing it, the Honolulu Fire Department was going to war," she said. "Three firefighters would never return, and six others would be seriously injured."The ceremony also featured a Japanese peace prayer, a Hawaiian blessing and a moment of silence at 7:55 a.m., the minute the bombing began. F-22s from the Hawaii Air National Guard 199th Fighter Squadron and Air Force 19th Fighter Squadron conducted a flyover.Later in the afternoon, the four USS Arizona survivors planned to visit the memorial for a toast to their fallen shipmates with a glass of sparkling wine given to their survivors association by President Gerald Ford, using glasses that are replicas of the ones on the ship. After the toast, divers would place one of the glasses at the base of the Arizona's gun turret four. It's where ashes of 38 Arizona survivors are interred.This year's anniversary will likely be the last one Ervin Brody, 91, of Houston attends. "Expenses are getting up there and we're retired," he said. "A lot of us figure this will be the last."

The chairman of the Institute for Functional Medicine says we're becoming more dependent on sugary foods and drinks - saying they're even more addictive than cocaine.On"CBS This Morning," Dr. Mark Hyman said, "In animal studies, they find that the rats go for the sugar and that it's eight times as addictive as cocaine. Small amounts of sugar can be part of a normal diet, but most of us are addicted to sugar and don't know it."Hyman himself has gone as far as calling sugar and sugary foods "deadly."He told the New York Daily News that "sugar is the new nicotine. And worse, sugar actually causes diabetes and obesity."The doctor's trying to help people find ways to lessen their dependence on sugar with tips from his book, "The Blood Sugar Solution 10-Day Detox Diet."On the book's website, Dr. Hyman says 600 people took part in the diet, which encourages healthier eating habits. Together, they lost more than 4,000 pounds, and their average blood pressure fell by about 10 points.Dr. Hyman told New York Daily News the average American eats 152 pounds of sugar a year. Whoa.

http://www.aol.com/article/2014/07/14/emerging-nations-plan-their-own-world-bank-imf/20931075/	Emerging nations plan their own world bank, IMF	WASHINGTON (AP) - Fed up with U.S. dominance of the global financial system, five emerging market powers this week will launch their own versions of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -the so-called BRICS countries - are seeking "alternatives to the existing world order," said Harold Trinkunas, director of the Latin America Initiative at the Brookings Institution.At a summit Tuesday through Thursday in Brazil, the five countries will unveil a $100 billion fund to fight financial crises, their version of the IMF. They will also launch a World Bank alternative, a new bank that will make loans for infrastructure projects across the developing world.The five countries will invest equally in the lender, tentatively called the New Development Bank. Other countries may join later.The BRICS powers are still jousting over the location of the bank's headquarters - Shanghai, Moscow, New Delhi or Johannesburg. The headquarters skirmish is part of a larger struggle to keep China, the world's second-biggest economy, from dominating the new bank the way the United States has dominated the World Bank.The bloc comprises countries with vastly different economies, foreign policy aims and political systems - from India's raucous democracy to China's one-party state.Whatever their differences, the BRICS countries have a shared desire for a bigger voice in global economic policy. Each has had painful experiences with Western financial dominance: They've contended with economic sanctions imposed by Western powers. Or they've been forced to make painful budget cuts and meet other strict conditions to qualify for emergency IMF loans.Now, says Thomas Wright, a fellow at Brookings' Project on International Order and Strategy, "they want a safety net if they fall out with the West."Developing countries have also been frustrated because the U.S. Congress has refused to approve legislation providing extra money to help the IMF make more loans to countries in trouble. The money is part of a broader reform program that would give China and other developing countries more voting power at the IMF.Uri Dadush, an economist with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, sees no problem with the BRICS countries' development bank and financial crisis fund. But he worries that the five countries' decision to go outside of existing institutions provides more evidence of the "fracturing of the postwar (economic) system that gave us so much peace and prosperity. The system has not been able to adapt to the new reality, the rise of the new powers."The IMF and the World Bank seem to be taking the new challengers in stride."All initiatives that seek to strengthen the network of multilateral lending institutions and increase the available financing for development and infrastructure are welcome," said IMF spokeswoman Conny Lotze. "What is important is that any new institutions complement the existing ones."Answering a question about the BRICS development bank earlier this month, World Bank President Jim Kim said: "We welcome any new organizations ...

The married couple from Santa Cruz, Calif. engage in a practice called “co-nursing,” in which they share breastfeeding duties. “Our friends are fascinated by the fact that my wife and I both breastfeed our daughter,” Heidi, 26, a nanny and the baby’s birth mom, tells Yahoo Parenting. “We get a lot of, ‘Wow, that’s amazing!’ and ‘I didn’t know that was possible!’”STORY: Sperm Brought These Two Women TogetherInduced lactation is indeed possible through dedicated nipple stimulation — either by putting baby to breast or with the aid of a breast pump — and is sometimes used by moms (and, very rarely, men) with adopted or surrogate children who want to breastfeed. Mary Ellen has opted for something called the Newman-Goldfarb protocol, a physician-developed approach that combines pumping with the taking of a drug called domperidone. Heidi, who lactates on her own, gave birth to Sequoia at the couple’s home after a year-long struggle with endometriosis which included laparoscopic surgery to remove her ovarian cysts. She became pregnant through an intrauterine insemination (IUI), a process in which donor semen is implanted in the uterus with the help of a physician. STORY: Can a Controversial Pill Help Women Breastfeed?While there aren’t many statistics on the prevalence of co-nursing, according to New York City based lactation consultant Sara Chana, its health benefits as a result of using domperidome are unknown. “A new mom’s breast milk is designed for and evolves to suit the specific needs of her infant at every stage,” Chana tells Yahoo Parenting. “So it’s tough to say how drug-induced milk would benefit a baby who is already breastfeeding from her natural mother.” Although Chana doesn’t personally work with women who co-nurse, her clients include mother-daughter pairs who nurse each other’s babies, and sisters who “nurse the other’s baby if one is stuck in traffic, for example.” Photo by Santa Cruz Birth Photography; Mary Ellen breastfeeds Sequoia.Heidi and Mary Ellen decided to co-nurse so Mary Ellen could reap the health and bonding benefits of breastfeeding. Babies who nurse are better able to fight off bacteria and viruses, for example, while women who nurse are at less risk for breast and ovarian cancers. Plus, the eye contact and skin-to-skin contact during nursing sessions boosts the mother-baby connection. “I wanted to experience that closeness with my daughter, especially since I didn’t give birth,” Mary Ellen, 25, a graduate student, tells Yahoo Parenting. “It didn’t occur to us that we could also help each other out when we’re exhausted.” When Heidi was five months pregnant, Mary Ellen heard about domperidone, a dopamine-receptor blocker that has a surprising side effect of boosting a woman’s breastmilk supply by triggering the release of the hormone prolactin. Although women have been taking the drug for decades — and Australian doctors recently urged the medical community to reconsider prescribing it for off-label use to aid lactation — it’s been called into question by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for causing cardiac problems and unknown risks for infants. Still, while the drug is not FDA approved, it’s commonly prescribed in Europe and Canada; some American lactation coaches and physicians encourage its use, although many refuse to prescribe it.“My doctor wouldn’t give it to me so I had to order it through an online Canadian pharmacy,” says Mary Ellen. “I did lots of research and got the green light from my midwife.” Now Mary Ellen takes 12 pills per day, along with capsules made with fenugreek, an herb that encourages lactation. She also drinks an herbal formula called More Milk, and pumps once a day, all of which allows her to produce three to four ounces of breast milk per session.  The women don’t have a set routine for who nurses Sequoia. “It’s more, ‘I’m doing dishes and she’s about to wake up — can you nurse her?’” says Olson. “Women have told us that they wouldn’t dream of sharing the breastfeeding experience, but we don’t have any jealousy issues. Everyone wins here.” During the first week of Sequoia’s life, Olson primarily breastfed on the advice of her midwife to kickstart her supply, but now both women share responsibilities. And, just like other moms, the couple refrigerates and freezes their breast milk, often mixing it all up in one bottle. “In that case, it’s possible that the baby could be getting double the immunity boost from the milk,” says Chana. “Breast milk is always better than no breast milk.”

Monster Contributing Writer It’s important to build good relationships at work, but there are a lot of characters you should watch out for. Here are six people you should avoid. The Gossip A little chit-chat is fine, but watch out when people start spreading gossip about co-workers. “It's important to avoid the gossipers and the talkers in general,” says Stephanie Lindquist of the Love Your Job Project. “Don't get caught up in the noise. Avoid these people at all costs. Sometimes that may mean interrupting them and letting them know you have to jump on another call or head into a meeting. However you handle it, steer clear!” The Party Animal They may be a blast to be with, but Party Animals can damage your reputation at work. Their bad behavior and loose lips can bring you down. “This person might be fun to hang out with but she is also prone to let info slip every now and then — something that should be avoided when you're making a name for yourself at a company,” says Andrea Berkman Donlon, founder of The Constant Professional, a personal branding and reputation management company. The Ego Booster   This one may be hard to spot, because after all, they like to tell you about all the credit you should be getting and how important you are to the company. But at the same time, they’re suggesting that nobody around you really appreciates what you do for them, says career coach Lisa Meece. “This creates two problems: it creates a distance between you and the team of people around you, and encourages you to focus on getting the credit instead of doing the work,” she says. Getting credit in healthy organizations is not a zero-sum game, she says, and suggests focusing on doing good work and bringing up the whole team. The Downer   Someone who is always looking at the bad side of things or negative aspects of any situation is someone to watch out for, says Abby Locke, executive brand coach. Whether the company wants to add a new policy or the boss starts a new initiative, this person will always complain and every conversation is a negative experience, she says. The Backstabber  The Backstabbers are the people who will do anything to advance their careers and are always throwing others under the bus to help their reputations, Locke says. They always have ulterior motives and the real intention to get over on someone, not to help people. The Complainer   “No matter what is going on in their life, the complainer always has something to whine about,” says Erik Episcopo of Resume Genius. “Of course, everyone has problems and at times needs to get things off their chest, but when it comes to the complainer there is no end.” Whether it's at work or at home, they always seem to be the victim, Episcopo says. “At first you may feel sorry for them and want to help. As time goes on, you will start to notice that there is no pleasing the complainer and that the time spent listening to them wastes valuable time.” Episcopo suggests trying to change the conversation to focus on solutions — or simply saying you’re on a short deadline and need to get back to work.

Sources indicate the deal was put together by SHR and will introduce a new sponsor to the sport of NASCAR Sprint Cup Series racing.Patrick offered a preview of her 2016 colors on Twitter Monday, without giving away the details:After 23 races of the 2015 season, Patrick sits 22nd in the series standings with just two top-10 finishes. Throughout her three-year full-time Sprint Cup Series career, Patrick has six top-10 finishes. Her career-best finish was sixth at Atlanta Motor Speedway in 2014. In 2013, she became the first woman to qualify on the pole for the season-opening Daytona 500. Patrick quickly became one of the most popular drivers in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, winning the Sprint Fan Vote for the All-Star Race in two of the past three years.

I know exactly how you feel.I've jumped on the "I'm going to get healthy" train more times than I'd like to admit... usually around the new year, swimsuit season or a special event (like an upcoming reunion or wedding).I'd put my heart and soul into making changes. But, unfortunately, after a few weeks I'd fall off the "healthy train." I'd skip the gym, sneak unhealthy food, and cancel my much-needed doctor's appointment.The same old story would resurface in my mind: "I can't do this. I guess I'm destined to feel like crap the rest of my life. I'm just one of the unlucky ones. It'll never change."Thankfully, that was many years ago.Since then, I've recognized the reasons most people (including myself) "failed" when it came to making lasting health changes.Before I get into the pitfalls and how to avoid them, I want to remind you of this: Creating lasting change is a deeply spiritual journey because it requires you to deeply connect with your heart and soul.If you're ready to change your story, here are six steps that can help you make lasting health changes in your life.● Work with a Health Care Provider Being your own health care provider won't set you up for success in the way an experienced practitioner can. It's impossible to be objective about yourself. There are many holistically-minded physicians who love working with people on a deeper level. If you haven't found a health-care provider that you resonate with, don't give up! It's becoming easier to find good practitioners (and many, like myself, do online consultations).A skilled health care provider can help you focus in on the specific things that make the most impact in your health. They will assure you a correct diagnosis, order routine and specialized lab work (like food sensitivity panels or salivary adrenal panels), and thoroughly understand you and how your body works (because one size doesn't fit all).Find someone with whom you can have regular contact with, who takes the time to really get to know you, and who is excited to partner with you to achieve your health goals.● Create a Simple Protocol Work with your health care provider to formulate a simple plan... with the emphasis being on simple! The more complicated and intricate the protocol, the more likely you'll not be able to complete it. Some of the simplest things (i.e. drinking adequate water) have tremendous benefit to our health.Start with the end goal in mind. Where do you want to be in a month or in a year from now? Determine what simple steps will get you there. Start with a few things that make the biggest impact and then add slowly from there.Remember: If it's not doable, it doesn't get done.● Plan Ahead Not planning ahead will almost always set you up for failure. How many times have been on a healthy eating plan and forgotten your sack lunch (and fast food is all there is in sight)?It's so easy to be healthy when you plan ahead... sometimes it doesn't even feel like work! All it takes is a few minutes out of your day (the veggies won't wash and cut themselves) and you can be set for the week. Imagine opening the refrigerator and seeing healthy food already prepped and ready for you.Take the time to think about the next week or month. What do you need to make good choices? Food prep? Packing gym clothes the night before? A water bottle you can take with you?We tend to get derailed when we're tired, overwhelmed, or running late. Know what may get you tripped up for the week (like a late meeting or kids' pizza party) and plan for it.● Create Accountability This is one of my secret weapons with clients. There's something powerful about having a "check-in buddy" who will encourage you through the baby steps, milestones and off days.Find a friend, acquaintance, health care provider, or coach with whom you can have regular contact. Some clients will email or text me every day to check in. And, I've even had clients post their accountability on social media.Tell your accountability partner your plan for when you're ready to give up and quit. I'll even ask my clients, "When you're ready to quit what do you need to hear from me?" We're all different: some of us need a good ass kicking and others just need a hug.● Make It Enjoyable Nobody wants a healthy lifestyle plan that is boring, painful, or in any way awkward or uncomfortable. That doesn't create longevity on the road to wellness. If you are confused on how to even combine "healthy" and "fun," don't fret. A quick Internet search (like "healthy and fun activities") will get the creative juices flowing.And, don't forget a good old-fashioned reward system! As a kiddo, I'd do pretty much anything to get gold star or a pat on the back. How can you reward yourself? Even though I can buy a new pair of shoes any day, buying those sassy red heels after completing a 30-day health challenge brought me an endless supply of endorphins.● Be Holistically Mindful Anything in our lives that requires the deepest parts of our beings (including changing our health) is a deeply spiritual experience. Being open to the things that may come up (such as fears or resistance) could open up parts of us we'd rather not touch. But, true healing must happen deep within our spirits alongside our bodies.As holistic beings (mind, body, and spirit) focusing on one part (body) can only take us so far. It's like trying to balance a three-legged stool when you only have one leg.The clients who have the most success with me are those who know they are on a spiritual healing journey... and a healthy body is the side effect of a deeply examined and changed life.Work with your health care provider, therapist or spiritual guru to help guide you through this process. Using tools like meditation, prayer, journaling, mindfulness, and affirmations can help you along the way.PARTING THOUGHTS:What would it feel like to finally have the health you desire? Imagine jumping out of bed every morning, ready to start your day, because you look and feel amazing in your body.Planning ahead, getting together your team of health care practitioners and accountability partners, and creating a fun, doable plan are some of my "no fail" tricks for achieving the level of wellness you desire. Be mindful that changing your health is one of the most powerful, spiritual (and potentially difficult) journeys you'll ever go on. It changes you in such profound ways that wellness and health just ooze out of your being.Never give up. Life will throw you curve balls, drag you down, and try to knock you out... it's inevitable. But, through persistence and determination you'll reap the kind of benefits that'll give you goosebumps.
http://www.inquisitr.com/1648265/is-the-view-axing-rosie-odonnell-again-over-impossibly-rude-attitude/	Is ‘The View’ Axing Rosie O’Donnell Again Over ‘Impossibly Rude’ Attitude?	Perhaps, the second time is not a charm after all — for Rosie O’Donnell, that is. According to super-secret production sources connected with The View, the daytime talk show co-host is causing so much turbulence and division on the show that producers are considering parting company with Rosie. It seems O’Donnell’s rude attitude and toxic behavior are more than show executives — and supposedly, her View chat-fest colleagues — can bear, according to a TMZ report.The gossip site says it has credible information from insiders that believe Rosie’s days with the show are numbered, largely due to her return to basics. Allegedly, one production source, who wished not to be identified, says Rosie is a “malcontent,” and her interaction — or the lack thereof — with her co-hosts is dragging down TV ratings. It’s their belief the writing is on the wall about Rosie getting the ax.At the center of her supposed grumpy behavior is View moderator, Whoopi Goldberg. Evidently, Rosie O’Donnell returned to the show with the belief she would helm the show and assume the role Whoopi has occupied since 2007. Previously, Inquisitr reported O’Donnell’s return hinges on her pal not being the moderator — at least in her mind. But the decision apparently is not in her hands.Now that it is clear she is not the chief chat queen, sources say she is retaliating by shutting down and stirring up commotion, on and off the camera. As a consequence, execs want her gone prior to the end of the season before she drags the show down even further. And on her return next season, that option is supposedly off the table, as the rumor goes.From the first day of Rosie’s return after a seven-year absence, the comedienne ruffled collars. It all began when O’Donnell bared her feet, put her newly-pedicured toes on display and sat cross-legged in her chair.‘The View’ co-hosts“I’m trying to stretch my leg ’cause it hurts. So you’re going to see toes. I had them pedicured yesterday. Of course, I didn’t want them to be gross,” she explained to her audience during the premiere.Despite her sciatica flareup, apparently producers were not at all pleased by her antics. Early on, it was a sign that Rosie O’Donnell had not changed much from her old shenanigans. It’s this type of rogue behavior that is rumored to be partly behind her ouster in 2007. However, Rosie has a litany of other things that rubbed many the wrong way, according to RadarOnline.Who can forget her blowup with former View co-host, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, who recently said the tension between them has not been addressed and still remains? That alone was a distraction for the show, and O’Donnell’s infamous rants continued with a verbal brouhaha with Donald Trump.Apparently, the tension extends beyond Rosie and Whoopi; O’Donnell is allegedly rubbing newbies, Rosie Perez and Nicolle Wallace, the wrong way as well. On a recent View episode when the ladies chatted about the allegations surrounding Bill Cosby, O’Donnell challenged all three co-hosts in what some said was “just because” and for the sake of being condescending.Despite TMZ’s claims from its inside sources, O’Donnell’s rep dismissed the rumors about her potential ouster.“This is yet another in a long line of fabricated stories. Reports of Rosie leaving are false. Whoopi is the moderator and has been since she was hired in 2007. Rosie O’Donnell knew that before she took the job.”Should Rosie remain on the show, despite her abrasive behavior? Is it time Joy Behar returned? Can we all just get along?[Image via: RadarOnline, AceShowBiz]
http://news.yahoo.com/hundreds-funeral-woman-burned-alive-222744601.html	Hundreds at funeral for woman burned alive	BATESVILLE, Miss. (AP) — About 400 mourners packed a chapel in Mississippi on Saturday to say goodbye to a 19-year-old woman who was burned alive, among them classmates who used permanent markers to write heartfelt messages on her white metal coffin."Fly high, Jessica," said some, a reference to the former cheerleader's aerial acrobatics, according to the Rev. Eric Greggs, one of three speakers at the 45-minute service.Chambers graduated from South Panola High last year and worked in sales at a Batesville clothing and gift shop.Alabama author Linda Oliver said Chambers had recently asked her to help write a book about her life.Oliver, of Birmingham, said Chambers approached her while she was packing up after a speech about her own book at an Oct. 25 church conference in the Batesville area."She thanked me for sharing some of the horrible facts of my own story" and then asked for help with hers, Oliver said. "She said, 'I want my story to be told.'"Contacted later by email, Oliver was asked by an Associated Press reporter if she spoke with Chambers long enough to learn her story."No, sadly - there was not enough time that day for a long visit," Oliver replied.View gallery This undated photograph released by the families of Jessica Chambers and her sister Amanda Prince sh …The Rev. Larry Kilgore of Crowder Baptist Church, about 15 miles from the funeral home where Chambers' funeral was held, said she talked with him about personal problems, but had a relationship with Christ."Jessica was a young lady who just loved to be loved," he said.He didn't talk about Chambers' problems: "I will not expose her in death," he said.Greggs preaches at Community Church of God in Charleston, about 25 miles from Wells Funeral Home in Batesville, which live-streamed the service.He said a church member called last Sunday, the day Chambers' body was found, to tell him about her death. "I was struck with a heavy heart," he said. "I got off the phone and told my wife, 'I don't even feel like preaching anymore.'"But, he said, resurrection is the "good ending to the story.""We will see you on the other side. Hallelujah."The chapel where Chambers' funeral took place seats about 400 and was full, said owner Tommy Wells.Police are reconstructing the last few hours of Chambers' life and are asking the public to come forward with information. So far, they have few solid leads, in spite of $11,000 offered in rewards.She was still alive when a passing motorist saw her lying near her burning Kia Rio sedan about 8:15 p.m. Dec. 7, and she spoke to rescue workers, District Attorney John Champion has said."We're not releasing what she said, but we're acting on it," he said.Related Video:
http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/12/02/fast-food-strikes/3805129/	Fast-food strikes planned for 100 cities	NEW YORK — Fast-food workers in about 100 cities will walk off the job this Thursday, organizers say, which would mark the largest effort yet in their push for higher pay.The actions are intended to build on a campaign that began about a year ago to call attention to the difficulties of living on the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, or about $15,000 a year.The protests are part of a movement by labor unions, Democrats and other worker advocacy groups to raise pay in low-wage sectors. Last month, President Obama said he would back a Senate measure to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10.Protesters are calling for $15 an hour, although many see the figure as a rallying point rather than a near-term possibility.It's not clear how large the turnout will be at any given location, or whether the walkouts will be enough to disrupt operations. Similar actions this summer had varying results, with some restaurants unable to serve customers and others seemingly unaffected.The National Restaurant Association, an industry lobbying group, called the demonstrations a "campaign engineered by national labor groups," and said the vast majority of participants were union protesters rather than workers.The group added that past demonstrations "have fallen well short of their purported numbers."Kendall Fells, a New York City-based organizer for Fast Food Forward, said demonstrations are planned for 100 cities, in addition to the 100 cities where workers will strike. He said plans started coming together shortly after the one-day actions in about 60 cities this summer."They understand they're not going to win from a one-day strike," Fells said of workers.Still, organizers face an uphill battle in reshaping an industry that competes aggressively on low prices, a practice that has intensified as companies including McDonald's Corp., Burger King Worldwide Inc. and Yum Brands Inc. face growing competition and slow growth in the weak economy.Fast-food workers are also seen as difficult to unionize, given the industry's high turnover rates. But the Service Employees International Union, which represents more than 2 million workers in health care, janitorial and other industries, has been providing organizational and financial support to the push for higher pay over the past year.Berlin Rosen, a political consulting and public relations firm based in New York City, has also been coordinating communications efforts and helping organizers connect with media outlets.In the meantime, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has promised a vote on the wage hike by the end of the year. But the measure is not expected to gain traction in the House, where Republican leaders oppose it.Supporters of wage hikes have been successful at the state and local level. Last month, voters in New Jersey approved a hike in the minimum to $8.25 an hour, up from $7.25 an hour. California, New York, Connecticut and Rhode Island also raised their minimum wages this year.Copyright 2013 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

http://www.fhfn.org/woman-drinks-gallon-of-water-every-day-for-four-weeks-and-the-final-picture-results-are-shocking/	Woman Drinks Gallon Of Water Every Day For Four Weeks And The Final Picture Results Are Shocking	Sufficient daily water intake is vital for virtually every function within our bodies yet fewer than one in five of us drinks enough. Read on to see the results of this experiment.Sarah Smith is a 42 year old mother of two young kids in the UK. She, like many others, openly admitted to not drinking the recommended 2 to 3 liters of water daily. She suffered from poor and sluggish indigestion and regular headaches. Following consultations with medical professionals for both issues she decided to take heed of the advice given – in both cases she had been told that she needed to up her intake of water. She decided to document and photograph what happened in a self imposed experiment whereby she would drink 3 liters, just over 5 pints, of water per day, every day for an entire month and see if she could feel any benefits.At the outset Sarah took a long hard look at her face noting that “I am 42, but have to admit I look more like 52 in this picture, which is shocking. There are dark shadows under and around my eyes, which make me look exhausted, a profusion of wrinkles and strange reddish blotches, and my skin lacks any lustre. It looks dead….even my lips look shrivelled.” She spread the water out during the day aiming to drink a big jug of water in the morning, another in the afternoon with a third in the evening.At the end of the FIRST WEEK she had already noticed that her bowel function was improved and her urine was virtually clear as the water was flushing out her previously dehydrated poorly functioning kidneys. She noticed sudden skin breakouts, which were a result of the toxins being eliminated from throughout her body. However her headaches were already gone and her previous joint stiffness first thing in the morning was vastly improved. Water is vital for lubricating the joints.WEEK TWO saw an improvement in her skin tone and general complexion although she noted that her eyes were still wrinkled but said “they look less crepey and shadowy than before”. She also had a visibly flatter stomach and her smart husband paid her the ultimate compliment by noting that her cellulite had vanished! Significantly she had another week headache free.On to WEEK THREE  when Sarah was happy to find that her eye wrinkles and dark circles had all but disappeared and her skin was plumper and healthier looking. She noted that she was actually eating less by this stage as she had fallen into the common trap of reading signals from her stomach as being hunger pangs whereas they were actually thirst pangs. Research has shown that 37 per cent of people actually mistake thirst signals for hunger signals. The plentiful water had now stopped her from continually falling into that unhealthy trap.So what about the end of WEEK FOUR? Sarah said “I genuinely can’t believe the difference in my face. I look like a different woman. The dark shadows around my eyes have all but disappeared and the blotches have gone. My skin is almost as dewy as it was when I was a child. The transformation is nothing short of remarkable.” She was leaner, fitter and nobody can deny the astonishing change to her appearance. She changed nothing else in her daily routine apart from the water intake. Here are the before and after photographs:To those already of you already converted to drinking enough water these results will merely confirm what you already know, but to anyone who is guilty of not doing so, will this persuade you to try this for yourself ?

John Barrasso, the No. 4 Republican in the Senate, said in an interview on Friday that members of Congress had told Obama that would be a "toxic decision."(Reporting by Peter Cooney; Editing by Steve Orlofsky and Andre Grenon)
http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/meteorite-bears-evidence-of-magnetic-fields-in-early-solar-system/	Meteorite Bears Evidence of Magnetic Fields in Early Solar System	This story was originally published by Inside Science News Service.An ancient meteorite has now yielded the first physical evidence that intense magnetic fields played a major role in the birth of our solar system.Shortly after the sun formed about 4.6 billion years ago, a rotating disk of gas and dust that surrounded the newborn star coalesced into the planets that children now memorize. Astronomers peering at young distant stars find these protoplanetary disks usually disappear relatively quickly, in 5 million years or less.Most of the solar system's protoplanetary disk spiraled into the sun, leaving the star with 99 percent of the solar system's mass. However, it was a mystery how all this material could have swirled into the sun as fast as it apparently did. A number of theories for how this might have occurred involve magnetic fields."Magnetic fields can introduce viscosity into the disk, essentially making the gas in it more sticky," said lead study author Roger Fu, a planetary scientist at MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts. "This means gas of differing orbits interacts more strongly with each other, and more gas falls toward the star."To look for signs of these primordial magnetic fields, researchers investigated the so-called Semarkona meteorite, a rock weighing about 1.5 pounds that crashed in northern India in 1940."It's a very primitive meteorite, which means that since it formed about 4.5 billion years ago, not much has happened to it," Fu said. "This means it preserves the properties it had when it first formed, helping shed light on that time."Semarkona is made up mostly of tiny round pellets known as chondrules, which formed as molten droplets that quickly cooled in space. The scientists focused on chondrules that possessed iron-bearing minerals known as dusty olivine crystals — if a magnetic field was present as these chondrules were cooling, the magnetic properties of these crystals might have recorded the strength of these magnetic fields.Researchers have searched meteorite samples for evidence of magnetic fields in the primordial solar system with little success since the 1960s."Most other meteorites were altered in some way that would remove their original magnetization — maybe they were heated, or water flowed through them, or they experienced high pressure from impacts," Fu said. "Semarkona is one of the few meteorites we know of that avoided all of these things."Still, analyzing the magnetic signatures of these chondrules was not easy. The pellets were at most about one-fiftieth of an inch (500 microns) wide, or roughly five times wider than the average width of a human hair. In addition, the magnetic signatures were very weak, requiring the use of a microscope that employs a superconducting quantum interference device, the most sensitive kind of magnetic field sensor.The scientists discovered the chondrules were magnetized in a field roughly 54 microtesla in strength. This is about as strong as Earth's magnetic field, and up to 100,000 times stronger than what exists in interstellar space today."This is the first direct information we have on the magnetic fields in the early solar system," said astrophysicist Mordecai Mac Low at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, who did not participate in this study. "It's a really difficult measurement that was very cleanly performed — it stands out as a real tour de force."This discovery "tells us that magnetic fields were large enough to be important in the accretion process that helped form the solar system," said astronomer Meredith Hughes at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, who did not take part in this research. "We had guessed that, but we had no evidence of that until now."These findings also yield insights on the as-yet-mysterious way in which chondrules form, which in turn may shed light on how planets arise, the researchers said. They found the meteorite's chondrules probably formed either as molten debris from the collisions of rocky bodies or from dust particles within gas melting together when they were compressed by a shock wave. It was unlikely they formed via electric currents, hot winds and other events that occur near the sun, because such events are believed to take place within magnetic fields stronger than 100 microteslas, far greater than what is seen with Semarkona."This information can help reveal where material was located for planet formation, how much was there, how long it stuck around, and how it changed over time," Hughes said.Future research could analyze meteorites from different times and places during the formation of the solar system. This could shed light on the nature of the magnetic fields in protoplanetary disks — whether gas was driven toward the sun by a turbulent pattern of magnetic fields or a more orderly, hourglass-shaped configuration of magnetic fields, Fu said.The scientists detailed their findings online Nov. 13 in the journal Science.Copyright 2013 American Institute of Physics. Copyright conditions and usage terms are subject to change at any time without consent or any type of prior notice.
http://www.voanews.com/content/us-judge-blocks-texas-abortion-law/2433360.html	US Judge Blocks Texas Abortion Law	A U.S. federal judge has blocked restrictions that would have banned abortions at most facilities in the southwestern state of Texas.U.S. District Court Judge Lee Yeakel ruled against a law Friday that would have required abortion facilities in Texas to meet hospital-level operating standards. The law, scheduled to take effect Monday, would have closed more than a dozen clinics. The state now has 19 abortion providers, the law’s challengers say."The overall effect of the provisions is to create an impermissible obstacle as applied to all women seeking a pre-viability abortion,'' Yeakel wrote in his 21-page ruling.Supporters of the law vowed to appeal the decision, saying the measure would protect women's health.   Critics said the law was unnecessary and would have resulted in nearly a million Texas women having to drive more than three hours to get an abortion.The law was part of a sweeping anti-abortion bill signed by Texas Republican Governor Rick Perry last year that has already shuttered most of the abortion clinics in the state.Abortion remains a highly charged issue in the United States after a woman's constitutional right to the procedure was upheld in a landmark 1973 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court.

Last November, the WEF warned that financial inequality threatened to undermine social stability and security on a “global scale.”
http://news.yahoo.com/years-authorities-family-killed-home-082338203.html	After years, authorities say family killed at home	SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) — Authorities searched for the missing McStay family across California and into Mexico, and found their bodies in the desert a hundred miles from home.They now say the family of four was slain before they ever left their house, and a man familiar to them was their killer.Investigators believe that Joseph McStay, 40, his wife, Summer, 43, and their sons, 4-year-old Gianni and 3-year-old Joseph, were bludgeoned to death in their home in the San Diego County community of Fallbrook on Feb. 4, 2010, San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon said Friday.Charles "Chase" Merritt, 57, a business associate of Joseph McStay, was charged with four counts of murder.Merritt, who has served prison time for burglary and receiving stolen property, did not enter a plea during a brief court appearance and was due back in court next week.His attorney, Robert Ponce, did not immediately return a call or email.View gallery FILE - This undated file image provided by the San Diego Police Department shows members of the McSt …Authorities refused to discuss a motive or any further details of how the family was killed, or evidence found at the home or at the site of the shallow graves 100 miles to the north where their skeletal remains were found by an off-roader late last year near Victorville and Interstate 15.Tearful family members said the arrest brought them some peace but left many questions."Joseph was a great brother, a great father," Joseph McStay's brother, Michael McStay, said as he choked back tears. "He would've done anything to protect those boys and Summer and he tried to help Chase and provide work for this guy and this is how he was repaid. ... He'll get what he's got coming to him."There was no "smoking gun" that helped solve the case after so many years, San Bernardino County sheriff's Sgt. Chris Fisher said.Rather, the agency re-examined 4,500 pages of evidence handed over by authorities in San Diego County, where the probe began, served 60 search warrants and did 200 interviews. Evidence found at the gravesite also helped, Fisher said, declining to elaborate.View gallery This Wednesday, Nov. 5, 2014 photo provided by the San Bernardino County Sheriff's office, inves …"Our job is to look at everyone and eliminate who we could and see where this was going to take us — and it led us to him," he said of Merritt.Bennett Merritt, Merritt's brother, said in a brief phone interview that his sibling was "absolutely not guilty."Joseph McStay designed and installed home water features. Investigators said he had asked Merritt, who owned a waterfall company, to design some special waterfalls, and the two met at a restaurant on the day the family is believed to have been killed.Merritt's name had surfaced previously in the investigation. In 2011, Merritt told investigators that Joseph McStay's last cellphone conversation was to him. Fisher said investigators had interviewed Merritt several times but declined to say what information he provided.The long, convoluted investigation began when the family vanished from their home without a trace. At the time, San Diego County sheriff's detectives said it appeared they had fled at a moment's notice.View gallery This Wednesday, Nov. 5, 2014 photo provided by the San Bernardino County Sheriff's office, inves …Investigators found their dogs outside with no food or water, eggs rotting on a counter, and bowls full of popcorn in the house.Four days after the family vanished, their white Isuzu Trooper was found at a San Diego shopping mall just steps from Tijuana, Mexico. A dark surveillance video shows four people walking across the border.Authorities initially thought they might have been the McStays but later discounted that theory.Investigators said there were no signs of forced entry at the family home or in their SUV. Nothing was missing from the home, and the couple's credit cards and tens of thousands of dollars in bank accounts were untouched.Merritt was arrested Wednesday in Los Angeles.He was sentenced to a total of more than two years in prison in the 1970s and 1980s for convictions on burglary, receiving stolen property and violating parole, said Bill Sessa, a prison spokesman.Court records in Los Angeles County show he also was sentenced for grand theft and burglary in 2001.
http://www.voanews.com/content/us-france-say-iran-can-have-nuclear-program-not-bomb/2509774.html	US, France Say Iran Can Have Nuclear Program, Not Bomb	U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry says he and his French counterpart, Laurent Fabius, agree that Iran has a right to a peaceful nuclear program but “not a track to a bomb.” Kerry and Fabius met in Paris where they discussed ongoing nuclear negotiations with Iran and other issues, ahead of Kerry’s trilateral meeting in Oman on Iran’s nuclear status.Kerry says he and Fabius believe that it would be “pretty easy” for a country to prove to the world that its nuclear plan is peaceful.   The secretary of state said the U.S. and France share a common goal as they take part in negotiations to resolve Iran’s nuclear crisis before a November 24 deadline.   “We are hand-in-hand linked in this effort and we will work extremely close together in the next weeks to try to find a successful path," Kerry said.     On Sunday, Kerry, Iran’s foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, and EU representative Catherine Ashton will try to make headway on Iran’s nuclear status during talks in Oman.   Iran insists on its right to enrich uranium.  Western powers have voiced concern that Iran wants to produce nuclear weapons.   Kerry says a unified P5 + 1 grouping - the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany - has presented Iran with “creative ideas” to help achieve its objectives.   “Now we will see if Iran is able to match the public words that they are prepared to prove to the world that they have a peaceful program, to match those words with the tough and courageous decisions that need to be made by all of us," Kerry said. "The time is now to make those decisions.”President Barack Obama says the United States and its P5 +1 allies have handed Iran a framework for a nuclear agreement, but says it will be weeks before anyone knows if there will be a deal.Obama said during a White House news conference Wednesday the deal would let Iran meet its peaceful energy needs.Former U.S. ambassador to Bahrain Adam Ereli says Iran has been engaging in what he calls a “shell game” of stalling and misleading the international community.   “What are they trying to hide or what are they trying to disguise?  They’re trying to disguise a commitment to a nuclear program that they’ve not given up and that they’re not going to give up," Ereli said.   Brookings Institution Middle East analyst Riccardo Alcaro says Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani may have difficulties “selling” a final nuclear deal to his domestic audience, if it appears Tehran has made concessions to the West.   But, he says there are several reasons why an agreement would be in Iran’s best interests.   “It would give Iran the chance to be reintegrated into the international community," Alcaro said. "It would give a boost to its economy which has been severely damaged by the sanctions.”   He says it would also help Rouhani’s government in terms of its international reputation and credibility.   
http://www.voanews.com/content/who-number-of-new-ebola-cases-in-west-africa-levels-off/2510199.html	WHO: Number of New Ebola Cases in West Africa Levels Off	The World Health Organization said the number of new Ebola infections in West Africa is about the same as it was the week before, with a rise in some areas and a decline in others.Reports from Sierra Leone found the number of new Ebola cases has risen drastically in the past weeks.Justin Forsyth, head of the Save the Children fund, said many of his staff have lost family members in the vicious outbreak."I met one of our education advisers that lost 14 members of his family. So they are dealing with a huge amount of pressure and anxiety, they're heroes in this struggle against Ebola and the international staff who are coming in to support this, nurses and doctors and logisticians and health advisors," Forsyth said.Those who are burying Ebola victims are as much in danger as those who care for Ebola patients, so they have to wear elaborate protective gear."Within Sierra Leone, there's a really, really elaborate burial rites and that includes washing by hand a diseased person and also at the funeral - touching the body," said Fiona McLysaght, country director of Concern Worldwide in Sierra Leone."So you've gone from a stage of having a very elaborate ceremony - then in this case, you've got people who were deceased and were taken from their family by people dressed from head to toe in plastic suits, they're indistinguishable and it's a very scary situation," McLysaght said.New Ebola cases slowIn Liberia, the frightening spread of Ebola seems to be slowing down, as the number of new cases has not grown. International aid providers said they are taking great care to prevent the spread of the virus."We have to run a very strict, no-contact policy, which means that in any zone where they're distributing, the site that they've chosen, they will establish what they will call the safe area," said Anna Halford, distribution coordinator for Doctors Without Borders. "So they will make the line of people around it, so that while we distribute straight out of the back of a truck so that nothing that people have touched, people are obliged to take, and vice versa."The international community is responding to calls for more help to the affected region.The Dutch navy is sending one of its biggest ships, Karel Doorman, with an entire hospital in a container. On the way to Africa, it will pick up additional aid from other European Union members.Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced his country's contribution on Wednesday."We will commit up to 20 million (Australian) dollars to staff an Ebola treatment center, a 100-bed Ebola treatment center in Sierra Leone," Abbott said. "This will be a center that's being built by the United Kingdom, but it will be staffed by Australia through a medical provider, Aspen, an Australian provider."Also Wednesday, U.S. President Barack Obama asked Congress to approve $6.18 billion in new emergency Ebola funds for West Africa and to prevent its spread outside the continent.

http://www.aol.com/article/2014/11/21/with-snow-still-piled-high-buffalo-faces-flooding/20997549/	With snow still piled high, Buffalo faces flooding	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Residents of western New York may soon have to worry about the water in their basements as well as the snow on their roofs.After a three-day onslaught that dumped a historic 7 feet of snow on the Buffalo area and killed at least 12 people, the sun came out Friday, but so did predictions of flooding caused by rain, temperatures up to 60 degrees and blocked catch basins."We are preparing now for more flooding than we've seen in a long, long time," Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. "We still have that challenge to look forward to." Cuomo said the state was sending in pumps, boats, helicopters and high-axle vehicles that can operate in 4 to 5 feet of water."If we're lucky we won't need any of it," he said. "But prepare for the worst and hope for the best."The National Weather Service issued a flood watch for Sunday to Wednesday.The snow remained a huge challenge. Officials were still urging people to put off nonessential travel so snow removal efforts could progress. Cuomo reopened a 132-mile stretch of the state Thruway that had been closed since Tuesday, but several exit ramps remained closed along the westernmost 75 miles."Assume if you get on headed west you can't get off until Pennsylvania," the governor said. He said roads remain "very dangerous."Local travel bans were beginning to be lifted Friday so delivery trucks can bring in food and other essentials to depleted supermarkets, the governor said.He warned, however, that lifting the travel bans was not a signal that "all is fine."Two more deaths were announced. A 50-year-old man was found Friday morning in his car, which was buried in snow in Cheektowaga, police said. The cause of death wasn't immediately known.One elderly resident of a nursing home, also in Cheektowaga, died after it was evacuated amid concerns of a roof collapse, a spokeswoman for the home said.More than 30 major roof collapses, most involving farm and flat-roof buildings, were reported overnight, officials said Friday, and warm temperatures could make the snow even heavier.Richard Tobe, the deputy Erie County executive, said more than 50 people were evacuated from several mobile home parks in suburban Cheektowaga and West Seneca on Thursday because roofs were buckling. At least 90 small roof collapses involving carports and other structures had been reported by Friday morning, in addition to damage to a pharmacy and a metal warehouse operated by a Christmas decorations company, where damage was estimated in the millions.Some farm animals had been injured in damaged barns, he said.Friday's improved weather inspired some homeowners to climb onto roofs to shovel off the snow and reduce the danger of collapse."Five hours yesterday and that's just the beginning," John Normile of Lake View said as he and his daughter and her boyfriend cleared up to 6 feet of snow from the roof of his ranch-style home."We're getting really concerned about the weight of it," Normile said. "We've got to do it before the rain comes."Weather Service meteorologist Jon Hitchcock said there might be trouble with drainage as snow and the uncollected autumn leaves underneath blocked catch basins."The biggest flood threat would be on Monday when temperatures are at their warmest," he said. "There could be general urban flooding.""There's roughly the equivalent of six inches of rain in the snowpack that will essentially be released over two days," Tobe said. "If it was released as rain it would be a monumental storm."He said flooding would likely affect mostly basements and creeks."It's not going to be this giant flooding like you see in hurricanes," he said.The American Red Cross issued an appeal for blood donations in the Rochester area, saying the snowstorms caused the cancellation of more than 50 blood drives. And Cuomo relaxed some rules governing prescription drugs, allowing patients to get prescription refills at any pharmacy that can verify them and letting doctors write new prescriptions more than seven days before the end of an earlier prescription.
http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/12/04/obama-ashton-carter-chuck-hagel-defense-secretary/19895589/	Obama to tap new Defense secretary Friday	WASHINGTON — President Obama will formally nominate Ashton Carter as new Defense secretary Friday, replacing the outgoing Chuck Hagel, officials said.White House spokesman Josh Earnest declined to identify Obama's pick — "the president will announce for himself who the nominee is" — but other administration officials said the president has decided on Carter.Carter's name leaked out earlier this week. Hagel announced his plans to resign on Nov. 24.Carter, who must be confirmed by the Senate, served as deputy secretary of Defense from October 2011 until his retirement in December 2013. His specialties include science, technology and developing the Defense budget in tight economic times.From 2009 to 2011, Carter — a Yale graduate with a degree in physics — served as undersecretary for acquisition, specializing in procuring equipment to meet emerging threats.Before he left the Pentagon, Carter was the military's top weapons' buyer and pushed hard for gear that troops needed to stay alive on the battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan: Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles to protect them from roadside bombs, surveillance equipment to spy on insurgents and bomb-sniffing dogs to find the buried mines that killed and maimed troops on foot patrols.Regarded as smart, capable, and wonkish, Carter also led the Pentagon review of its budget with a look toward cuts.In fiscal year 2001, adopted before the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Pentagon's budget was $297 billion. Ten years later, it had ballooned to $687 billion, including funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.At the Pentagon on Thursday, Hagel described his resignation as "a mutual decision" based on private talks he had with Obama. The outgoing secretary said the Pentagon faces new challenges, and that he considers the president a friend."Friends can talk plainly to each other," Hagel said. "I think you have to know when to leave, too.'"At the White House, Earnest said the next Defense secretary's challenges will range from the battle against the Islamic State to the fight against Ebola to efforts to reduce sexual assaults among military personnel.Asked about reports that some Pentagon officials feel micro-managed by the White House, Earnest said the military has bigger problems with Congress because it refuses to pass needed budget reforms.Tensions between the White House and Pentagon are common to all presidencies, Earnest said, but the bottom line is civilian control of the military.The next Defense secretary "will be very clear about what the chain of command is," Earnest said, and understand that "the president of the United States is the commander in chief and sits at the top of the chain of command. That means the president bears significant responsibility for what happens at the Pentagon and the Department of Defense."Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1zVWZRq

http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/12/12/ceasefire-holds-one-day-ukraine/20299739/	Ukraine: First casualty-free day since cease-fire	Ukraine's president said Friday that the fragile cease-fire between government forces and Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine held for the first full day since fighting began there in the spring."This is the first night when I don't have neither lost nor wounded Ukrainian soldiers, when we don't have any lost or wounded civilians," Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said in a speech in Sydney, Australia, where he's wrapping up a three-day trip. A continued cessation of violence would be "a great step for peace and stability in Ukraine," he said.The break in the fighting comes as Ukrainian media and military report on a leadership shakeup in separatist-held areas, where fighting between militants and Ukrainian forces had persisted despite a September cease-fire agreement.Ukrainian authorities have said a complete end to fighting is a prerequisite to pulling out heavy weapons and implementing the 12-point peace plan that marked the end of major combat operations in September but failed to stop smaller skirmishes.Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for Ukraine's National Security Defense Council, told reporters Wednesday that "once there is a full day without a single shot," the army would consider pulling heavy weapons 20 miles away from the cease-fire line.In August, Ukraine suffered devastating losses of 70% of its armor in what the U.S., NATO and Ukraine say was a Russian military counter offensive against a Ukrainian military poised to retake the separatist-held areas of Donetsk and Luhansk in the nation's east.Russia denied a role in the fighting, but Western governments and reporters provided photos and other evidence that Russian units participated. The USA and European Union have imposed sanctions on the Russian economy as a result of that country's involvement.In the past few weeks, Russian forces have removed several charismatic separatist leaders who were deemed insubordinate, Col. Sergii Kryvonos, Ukraine's chief of special operations, told USA TODAY during a visit to Washington this week."Russians started this cleansing operation to annihilate less loyal rebel groups," Kryvonos said. The main goal is to have the rebel groups in Donetsk and Luhansk under Moscow's control, he said.In the meantime, some separatist groups have gone rogue stealing coal and fighting with their Russian backers in the separatist areas, Col. Oleksiy Nozdrachov, Ukraine's chief of military and civilian cooperation in the Donbass region, said in Washington this week.Tighter Russian control could aid in holding the cease-fire. Earlier this week, Russian General Valeriy Gerasimov said the Ukrainian government invited his forces into Donetsk to "find compromise solutions to de-escalate tension and withdraw troops from lines of contact," according to German newspaper Deutche Welle.Still, Kryvonos is doubtful that even a truce that holds all winter will mean an end to the conflict. Since August, the Russians have sent nine large so-called humanitarian convoys to the separatist-held areas, which they've used to resupply forces there with equipment and ammunition, he said."They've increased their military capabilities," he said. "We think they'll use the winter time for preparation for a possible spring offensive."Contributing: The Associated PressRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1DnxlLu
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/01/30/utah-ape-predicts-seahawks-will-win-super-bowl/20819901/	Utah ape predicts Seahawks will win Super Bowl	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A Utah ape that has correctly picked the Super Bowl winner for six straight years predicted Thursday that the Seattle Seahawks will be the next NFL champion.Eli the ape ran into an enclosure Thursday morning and swiftly knocked down a papier-mache helmet bearing the Seahawks logo, signaling his pick, said Erica Hansen of Hogle Zoo in Salt Lake City."He made his pick without any hesitation," Hansen said.That could mean bad news for Broncos fans. The 13-year-old primate hasn't been wrong since 2006.Last year, Eli charged out and knocked over a papier-mache goal post decorated with the Ravens logo. Sure enough, the Ravens beat the 49ers 34-31.Eli's pick this year drew mixed reactions from his team of zookeepers that include avid Broncos fans."They are hoping that this is his first wrong year," Hansen said.After he made his prognostication, Eli was joined by his mate, Eve, and daughter, Acara, and allowed to smash, play and eat the papier-mache helmets.Hansen said interest and excitement about Eli's Super Bowl pick has increased as his streak grows. This year, people have been asking daily when he's making his pick."He's better than the Vegas odds-makers," Hansen said.

Get a great deal at your local dollar store this holiday seasonThe cost of holiday shopping can quickly add up -- not just the amount spent on gifts but also on everything else associated with celebrating the season. For example, consumers are expected to spend an average of $104.74 on food, $53.68 on decorations, $29.18 on greeting cards and $20.30 on flowers, according to the National Retail Federation. That’s nearly $208 on holiday-related items other than gifts. Throw in the presents, and consumers are expected to spend a total of about $804, on average, this holiday season, according to the NRF.One way to spend significantly less on many items on your holiday shopping list is to purchase them at dollar stores such as Dollar Tree, Family Dollar and Dollar General. You probably won’t be able to get most of the gifts your family and friends want at these discount stores, but you can get great deals on a variety of items you’ll need to help celebrate the holidays. Here are 10 things you can save a lot of money on by purchasing them at a dollar store.More from Kiplinger : 17 Gifts That Keep on GivingView gallery.

Witnesses Say ‘It Was Pretty Bad, The Tires Exploded’	Angelina Jolie was in a car accident Sunday, one that a witness states was “pretty bad.” According to X17 Online, the witness saw “the tires explode” on the vehicle the actress was riding in after it skidded in the rain and hit a curb. Angelina was reportedly being chauffeured back to her Los Angeles home when the accident occurred.Jolie was at the Writers’ Guild Theater in Beverly Hills for a screening of Unbroken, a movie that she recently directed. After attending the screening, X17 reports that the black SUV she was riding in “took off rather quickly” from the theater and then skidded on the wet road, sliding into a curb with “extreme force.”The accident happened shortly before 7 p.m., with the driver almost losing control of the vehicle when the SUV’s front tires exploded after hitting the curb. Witnesses noted that the SUV Jolie was riding in hit the curb at a “significant speed.”“The car slammed into the curb at a significant speed. Angelina must have wondered if they hit another car. It was pretty bad — the tires exploded and it’s amazing nothing worse happened to the car. I wouldn’t be surprised if she has whiplash.”Jolie reportedly did not receive medical attention at the scene, with Mail Online reporting that Brad Pitt’s wife was picked up by another driver in a second hired car shortly after the accident. Prior to the crash, Jolie smiled for the paparazzi while on the red carpet prior to the screening of her new film, Unbroken. The movie, due out on Christmas, is based on the best-selling book Unbroken written by Laura Hillenbrad.Angelina jolie has done a fine job with Unbroken, an epic war drama that has plenty of surprises. Great cast, cinematography. Grade A. — Showbiz 411 (@showbiz411) December 1, 2014Unbroken chronicles the life of Louis Zamperini, an Olympic runner who was captured by Japanese forces during World War II and spent two years as a prisoner of war. The movie stars Jack O’Connell, a British actor who the Hollywood Reporter states “has displayed great promise in a few other very small films.”Mail Online reports that Jolie’s children have seen the movie and think Zamperini, who died at the age of 97 last July, was a hero.“This man’s life is about forgiveness and unity. My own children have watched it and they walked out of it and thought he was a hero.”Angelina Jolie has not issued a statement about Sunday’s car accident, but from all accounts, it appears that the actress, director and mother of six was only shaken up and not injured.[Image: The Australian]

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/everything-think-know-vitamins-wrong-203402873.html	Everything You Think You Know About Vitamins Is Wrong	Reuters The jury is still out on the benefits of vitamins. With the new year coming up, many of us think of this as a time to take stock of our lives and do what we can to get healthy. And while there are plenty of useful steps we can take to transform our lifestyle, one of the most common — remembering to take a daily vitamin — may actually do more harm than good.Vitamins sound like a great idea. One pill that can provide you everything you need!If only they worked.Half of American adults take vitamins every day. Yet after decades of research on vitamins, reviews don't find any justification for our multivitamin habit, and in some cases, vitamins have actually been associated with an increased risk of various cancers.It's not that your body doesn't need vitamins A, C, E, and so on. Without those substances we have a hard time turning food into energy and can develop conditions like scurvy or rickets.The argument of vitamin makers is that we don't get enough of these substances from our diets. Plus, there's the implication that when it comes to vitamins, getting something extra can't hurt.But there's a growing body of evidence that for the vast majority of people in the US, that's just not true.Not only have researchers been unable to show a benefit to taking multivitamins or antioxidants for the general population, high doses of supplemental betacarotene, vitamin E, and potentially vitamin A have been associated with a higher risk of death.Researchers do say that more work is needed before they can determine whether supplemental vitamin D may offer benefits for some people, though that still isn't a claim that it's necessary. And there may be small subgroups of the general population who for one reason or another need to compensate for a deficiency. But writing last year in the journal "Annals of Internal Medicine," researchers were clear:Most supplements do not prevent chronic disease or death, their use is not justified, and they should be avoided. This message is especially true for the general population with no clear evidence of micronutrient deficiencies, who represent most supplement users in the United States and in other countries.Or as Paul Offit, chief of the infectious diseases division of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, wrote in The New York Times, vitamin manufacturers have successfully prevented the Food and Drug Administration from regulating the vitamin industry and informing the general population of whether not vitamins are safe in any way.Because of that, he says, "consumers don’t know that taking megavitamins could increase their risk of cancer and heart disease and shorten their lives; they don’t know that they have been suffering too much of a good thing for too long."So the next time some well-meaning person asks you if you took your vitamins, you can happily respond, "Absolutely not."

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-nato-state-wins-big-140000938.html	One NATO state wins big from clashes with Putin	Russian President Vladimir Putin is trying to make the best of a tough geopolitical situation, and one NATO member is seeing big benefits.Russia scrapped plans for a pipeline into Southern and Central Europe, and instead announced this week a new pipeline to carry discounted natural gas into Turkey . Moscow has already spent $4.5 billion on the so-called South Stream project, which would have seen Gazprom (Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange: SBNF-MZ) transport its product under the Black Sea and potentially all the way to Italy by way of several countries.Turkey will be getting gas at what some have suggested may be a double-digit discount, while furthering its aspirations to be a regional energy hub."Turkey is looking out for itself," said Lauren Goodrich, senior Eurasia analyst at global intelligence and advisory firm Stratfor. "It's good for Russia to have a country that has a stake in Ukraine and a stake in the Black Sea and a NATO member that isn't putting sanctions on Russia...Turkey is standing on its own and they're going to reap the benefits from it."Following Russia's announcement it was abandoning the project, some European politicians have already suggested that the South Stream project could be revived.Read More Why the Russia-China gas deal mattersGazprom has reported that discounts could be about 6 percent for Turkish customers, Goodrich said, but Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak reportedly said an arrangement could settle on a 15 percent discount."Turkey is in a very interesting position," Goodrich said. "They see an opportunity that the rest of the world is kind of against Russia right now, so if they work with Russia they can get a better deal."Russia previously announced a gas deal with China that many have said favored Beijing because of the geopolitical pressure on Moscow from Europe and the United States.Still, experts stressed that those deals do not mean Russia is desperate, but simply playing its cards as well as it possibly can.Putin's Monday announcement of the $30 billion South Stream pipeline's cancellation marked the culmination of increasing difficulties for the project, which began in 2007. Bulgaria ceased construction on its part of the line in June following pressure from the European Commission that the deal would violate the Third Energy Package legislation, and other E.U. states were being similarly influence, Goodrich explained.Read More Putin may go on ruble speculator witch hunt: ProAdditionally, the cost of the project had ballooned from its original $10 billion projection, with some estimates putting the ultimate price tag around $50 billion. While the new Turkish pipeline may cost as much, Goodrich said, Moscow sees the market there as more promising than the tepid European one.In fact, Russia has already found a successful partnership with Turkey in the Blue Stream pipeline between the two countries, explained Tim Boersma, acting director for the Energy Security Initiative at Brookings. He described this week's announcement as a "reinforcement" of those relations that reflects shifting global energy demand."Similar to China, in Turkey natural gas demand is expected to increase substantially in the coming decades, whereas European gas demand is in decline," Boersma told CNBC. "I think Russia's decision should be seen in that context, and is further incentivized by the anti-Russian sentiment in Europe."While experts said the South Stream cancellation was largely due to other factors, the sanctions and rhetoric against Moscow from the West have taken their own toll on the Russian energy sector. The major drop in oil prices has also taken a toll.Read More US expands Russia sanctions to Sberbank, energy firms"The Russian economy is obviously in a dire state at this point," Boersma said, pointing to an estimated $100 billion annual cost of oil's decline and a $40 billion yearly effect from sanctions. "Having said that, I have always believed that there will be buyers for Russian commodities, even if the U.S. and Europe believe that they can 'isolate' Russia, and the deals with China and Turkey are good examples of this in my view."Still, damage from sanctions is likely to become increasingly dire for the Russian energy sector, Goodrich said, as firms will find it impossible to secure credit for either new projects or to pay off loans. Moscow-controlled oil company Rosneft (Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange: ROSN1-MZ) is particularly disadvantaged, with $23 billion due in the next 3 months, but Gazprom would also suffer if sanctions continued for years.Another consequence of the sanctions have been the loss of faith in Russian companies, James Henderson, senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies said in a Thursday talk at Columbia University. In fact, Rosneft oil sales to Japan have essential ceased because no one wants to finance those deals, he said.Read More Why is Putin buying gold?The loss of Western energy technology will also begin to take a toll on the sector, as American and European firms are the only ones possessing the capabilities to access Russia's energy reserves. "Everything that is conventional energy in Russia has really been tapped," she said.Chinese companies have developed some of those required technologies, but they remain untested, Goodrich added.
http://news.yahoo.com/key-developments-disappearance-airasia-jet-100451585.html	Key developments in disappearance of AirAsia jet	An AirAsia jet with 162 people on board disappeared Sunday morning while flying from western Indonesia to Singapore on a scheduled two-hour flight. Here's a look at the key developments:___POSSIBLE SIGNSSearchers found objects and oil slicks hundreds of miles apart from each other and were trying to determine whether any of them were connected to AirAsia Flight 8501.Air Force spokesman Rear Marshal Hadi Tjahnanto told MetroTV that an Indonesian helicopter spotted two oily spots in the Java Sea east of Belitung island, not far from the point where air-traffic controllers lost contact with the plane. He said oil samples would be collected and analyzed to see if they are connected to the missing plane.Jakarta's Air Force base commander Rear Marshal Dwi Putranto said an Australian Orion aircraft had detected "suspicious" objects near Nangka island. The objects were about 700 miles (1,120 kilometers) from the location where the plane lost contact."We cannot be sure whether it is part of the missing AirAsia plane," Putranto said. "We are now moving in that direction, which is in cloudy conditions."___THE SEARCHERSSearch and rescue crews have been looking for the plane in at least 15 ships, seven aircraft and four helicopters, national search and rescue spokesman Jusuf Latif said. Most are Indonesian but Singapore, Malaysia and Australia have contributed planes, and a ship and aircraft from Thailand were awaiting clearance from Indonesian foreign ministry.Those numbers do not include Indonesian warships taking part in the search. Many fishermen from Belitung island also have joined in, and all vessels in that area of the sea have been alerted to be on the lookout for anything that could be linked to the plane.The local rescue agency in East Belitung, the closest district to the area where the plane disappeared from radar, deployed more than 10 boats near Nangka island following reports that people there had heard an explosion Sunday morning. Andriandi, the head of the agency, said the vessels searched around several small islands but found no clue to the plane's whereabouts.Soelstyo, head of the national search and rescue agency, said that if the plane is found on the sea floor, Indonesia lacks the capability to haul it to the surface, so the agency and the foreign ministry are arranging to borrow equipment from the United Kingdom, France or the United States.___SEARCH AREADjoko Murjatmodjo, Indonesia's acting director general of transportation, said the Airbus A320-200 is believed to have gone missing somewhere over the Java Sea between Tanjung Pandan on Belitung island and Pontianak, on Indonesia's part of Borneo island. Authorities on Monday greatly expanded the search area, which covers tens of thousands of square kilometers.___COCKPIT REQUEST DENIEDIn the cockpit's last communication with air traffic control, one of the pilots asked to turn left and climb to 11,582 meters (38,000 feet) to avoid clouds. Air traffic control was not able to immediately grant the request because another plane was in airspace at 34,000 feet, said Bambang Tjahjono, director of the state-owned company in charge of air-traffic control. He said that by the time clearance could be given, Flight 8501 had disappeared.___FAMILIES IN SHOCKDozens of relatives of people aboard the plane waited in agony for any word in a room at Surabaya airport.In Sidoarjo, the East Java home of the pilot, Iryanto, neighbors, relatives and friends gathered Monday to pray and recite the Quran to support the distraught family. Neighbors described Iryanto as an experienced Air Force pilot who flew F-16 fighter jets before becoming a commercial airline pilot, and said he had been the neighborhood chief for the last two years.___CEO'S RESPONSEMalaysian businessman Tony Fernandes, AirAsia's chief and the face of the company, said on Twitter, "My heart bleeds for all the relatives of my crew" and the passengers. He did not address compensation issues or any changes that may be made to the airline as a result of this incident, but tweeted that among Indonesians he has received "nothing but pure support.Speaking to reporters at Jakarta's airport, Fernandez noted that AirAsia had zero fatal accidents before Sunday and added, "any airline CEO who says he can guarantee that his airline is 100 percent safe, is not accurate.""We have carried 220 million people up to this point," he said. "Of course, there's going to be some reaction, but we are confident in our ability to fly people, and we'll continue to be strong and continue to carry people who never could fly before."

http://sports.yahoo.com/news/stevan-ridley-season-other-patriots-215210444.html	Stevan Ridley is out for the season; other Patriots backs get added fantasy value	Stevan Ridley tore his ACL and MCL. We break down the fantasy implications.New England Patriots running back Stevan Ridley was diagnosed with a torn MCL and ACL in his knee and will miss the rest of the season. He suffered the injury on Sunday and he will likely have surgery in the coming days.Ridley was the lead back for the Patriots and had two games with at least 25 carries. He was on his way to another high volume of carries, but now the Patriots will have to look elsewhere. After he went down, Brandon Bolden moved from being just a special teams guy to one of the main backs. He'll be looking at a major bump and should be be a pickup for fantasy teams in need of a running back.Of course, Shane Vereen will get a bigger chance after a letdown thus far. He hasn't touched the ball more than 13 times in a game all season and has just 18 receptions on the year. He should get it going in no time. Rookie James White has been inactive for much of the season, but he'll be on the active roster now.Fantasy impact: White is still an interesting pickup because the Patriots have an "anybody's guess" backfield. Vereen should be an RB2 and Bolden is an RB3 until further notice.More from sbnation.com:49ers-Rams start/sit advice The best of Week 6 The sleepers of Week 6 The worst of Week 6 Joe Flacco puts up elite fantasy football numbers Ravens erupt for a huge day The injuries of Week 6

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/russia-starts-economic-union-tomorrow-151600037.html	Russia Starts A New Economic Union On New Year's And It Already Looks Like A Disaster	REUTERS/Mikhail Klimentyev/RIA Novosti/KremlinA huge new economic union will begin on New Year's Day. You might not have heard about it, though, because its biggest member — Russia — has been a little preoccupied with its own economy recently.The Eurasian Economic Union (EEA), which succeeds the Eurasian Economic Community and customs union, begins on Jan. 1, 2015. It's made up of Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan.The bloc will be an EU-like single market, with its own commission, court and development bank.  Russian President Vladimir Putin even wants it to have a parliament. But there's absolutely no reason at all to think the union is going to be successful. In May, when the leaders were agreeing to the EEA, we were treated to the comedic image of just three presidents sitting around an enormous table which could seat five times as many, agreeing to the EEA. Ukraine refused to join, unsurprisingly.Kyrgyzstan and Armenia will be added to the union this year, too. That still leaves the bloc extremely unbalanced. Russia's population is more than four times as large as the other countries combined, and it will make up the vast majority of the EEU's GDP.Russia's economic woes barely need repeating. With oil prices falling, the ruble dropped to record lows dozens of times in recent months, falling to 80 against the dollar in one spectacularly turbulent day. It's down by more than 40% this year.Things were actually looking pretty ugly even before a large part of the ruble's collapse. Western sanctions have hit Moscow and the country's own finance minister expects a 4% drop in GDP in 2015.Can the other nations in the EEA help out? The short answer is no. Kazakhstan isn't immune to Russia's crisis. Its currency is now 50% more expensive in rubles than in the first half of the year. That makes it more difficult for Kazakh firms to export to Russia, though the Moscow Times suggests it may get a bit of a boost from investors who are concerned about Russian sanctions, but still want a presence in the region.The Kazakh economy is doing well in a lot of ways. That might be why long-term autocrat Nursultan Nazarbayev doesn't want to tie himself too closely to Moscow. He actually invented the contemporary idea of a Eurasian union, and even he doesn't seem convinced any more, insisting that the country could leave if it wanted, according to the FT.What's more, according to Foreign Policy magazine, studies actually suggest that membership of the Eurasian Customs Union has so far weakened Kazakhstan's economy. It's too late to back out now, but it's no surprise that Astana isn't rushing into anything more serious. The economy of Belarus isn't looking so hot. On 21 December Alexander Lukashenko, who like Nazarbayev has ruled the country for decades, sacked the prime minister and central bank chief. Belarus is extremely dependent on Moscow and exposed perhaps more than any other nation to the collapse of the ruble. As in Russia, there have been queues to exchange currency, and massive interest rate hikes.Aside from the immediate crisis, it doesn't look like Lukashenko will be presiding over a dynamic economic any time soon. An apparent obsession with farming led to a plan for the country to return to a sort of serfdom earlier this year.So of the five countries joining the union in 2015, by far the largest is likely to have a shrinking economy. The World Bank notes that about a third of Kyrgyzstan's  GDP is made up of remittances sent back by migrant workers, a large number of whom work in Russia. So a recession in Russia could push Kyrgyzstan into the same position. If that happens to Belarus too, a majority of the EEA's members would be in recession in its starting year.The EEA says it's open to new members, but it doesn't look like there's going to be a rush of countries trying to sign up. More From Business InsiderOBAMA: Putin's No Genius Putin's Luck May Finally Be Running Out Ukraine Needs Energy Reform To Fix Its Economy And Weaken Russia’s Grip

http://www.aol.com/article/2014/11/22/hitler-watercolor-sold-for-162-000-at-auction/20997691/	Hitler watercolor sold for $162,000 at auction	BERLIN (AP) - A watercolor of Munich's old city hall believed to have been painted by Adolf Hitler a century ago was sold for 130,000 euros ($162,000) at an auction in Germany on Saturday.Kathrin Weidler, director of the Weider auction house in Nuremberg, said the work attracted bidders from four continents and went to a buyer from the Middle East. She declined to elaborate.The auction house says the painting is one some 2,000 by Hitler and is thought to be from about 1914, when he was struggling to make a living as an artist, almost two decades before rising to power as the Nazi dictator.The painting, which had been expected to fetch at least 50,000 euros, was sold by a pair of elderly sisters whose grandfather purchased it in 1916.Hitler's paintings surface regularly, but the auction house said the 28-by-22 centimeter (11-by-8.5 inch) scene auctioned Saturday also includes the original bill of sale and a signed letter from Hitler's adjutant, Albert Bormann, brother of the dictator's private secretary Martin Bormann.From the text of the undated Bormann letter, it appears the Nazi-era owner sent a photo of the painting to Hitler's office asking about its provenance. Bormann wrote that it appears to be "one of the works of the Fuehrer."
http://www.voanews.com/content/obama-apec-us-committed-to-asia/2514335.html	Despite Tensions, China Gives Obama Warm Welcome	President Barack Obama has a received a warm welcome in China, despite tensions on issues like trade, human rights, and China’s territorial claims in the East and South China Seas.Relations between the two countries have been strained, in large part, because of Chinese suspicions that the United States wants to contain China’s growth.But both sides appeared wanting to accentuate the positive aspects of their relationship.Chinese leaders welcomed Obama at Beijing airport Monday with an honor guard and red carpet.Addressed APEC summit​Later, Obama addressed business leaders at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. Dispelling Chinese suspicions topped his agenda.“The United States welcomes the rise of a prosperous, peaceful, and stable China. I want to repeat that," the president said."We welcome the rise of a prosperous, peaceful and stable China. In fact, over recent decades, the United States has worked to help integrate China into the global economy. Not only because it’s in China’s best interests, but because it’s in America’s best interests and the world’s best interests. We want China to do well," Obama said.Deepening relations with China, Obama said, will mean more jobs and opportunity for the American and Chinese people.Obama also announced Monday a new visa policy with China, one that will increase the validity of short-term tourist and business visas issued to one another's citizens from one to 10 years - the longest validity allowed under U.S. law - and extend the validity of student and exchange visas from one to five years.The new agreement will go into effect November 12. Strained relationsBut Obama arrived in Beijing Monday for a visit that comes during a time of strained U.S.-Sino relations on issues ranging from cyber espionage to human rights as well as an impression among Chinese leaders that the U.S., through the rebalance of its forces to the Pacific, is trying to contain China.Washington and Beijing are pursuing rival trade deals.Obama is scheduled to hold talks with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, late Tuesday.The APEC summit is a chance for Obama to rally Asia-Pacific nations to overcome obstacles to approve the long-delayed TransPacific Partnership trade agreement.The U.S. leader gathered heads of state of 11 countries at the American embassy in Beijing and urged them to get past what he said are remaining “logjams.”On human rights, Obama refrained from condemning China for its behavior in Hong Kong, where demonstrators for months have accused Beijing of violating its commitment to not interfere in the autonomous region’s democratic process.The U.S. leader, however, said he remains concerned about what he described as a situation that is historically complicated.President Obama’s trip to China, Myanmar, and Australia, Nov. 10 – 16, 2014AgendaMonday was the start of Obama’s three-day visit to Beijing for the APEC summit and meetings with Xi.He also held bilateral talks Monday with Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott. Obama had a brief encounter with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but U.S. officials say the two leaders did not have time to discuss any issues.On Wednesday, he will travel to Myanmar, also known as Burma, before going to the G-20 summit in Australia.Pushing an agenda of greater cooperation will not be easy for Obama, who comes to Beijing politically weakened by mid-term elections at home.
http://www.heatworld.com/2015/08/stephanie-davis-strips-off-for-zoo-and-explains-what-really-happened-with-her-hollyoaks-exit	Stephanie Davis strips off for ZOO, and explains what REALLY happened with her Hollyoaks exit	Stephanie Davis was a fixture in Hollyoaks for five years, as waitress Sinead O’Connor.But in July, just four months after signing a year-long deal to keep her on the Channel 4 soap, her long relationship with the show came to an end and she was written out with immediate effect.Rumours of parties and drunken nights have emerged as potential reasons behind her removal, with the star even saying leaving the show was a “huge weight off my shoulders”.Only now has she revealed the true reasons for her departure to ZOO magazine, she said: “It was ultimately my choice to leave! I just walked and then the producers told me if I didn’t come back they’d have no option but to terminate my contract, but that it was my choice. I regret the way it ended – I probably should’ve gone about it in a better way, but I was desperate for a break.”“I’ve always had fun and when I started the show I did like to party, but I’m just like any normal 22 year old and I’m sure everyone is the same as they’re growing up – everybody has to be 18 and a little crazy at some point. The drunken thing was there for people to believe if they wanted to but I know people in the industry know me for what I really am.”Speaking about her photo shoot, she added: “I’ve always wanted to do a few sexy lingerie shoots but being in a soap was busy work so I didn’t have the time. I’m really happy at the moment and I’d love to strip off for you all again!”Steph’s planning to take her career in a different direction.“My passion has always been music, so I’ve been working with a few record labels and hopefully I’ll be in the studio soon and then I can look at releasing some tracks in the new year. I’ve written some really good music and the only other person I know to make the jump from soaps is Kylie Minogue – so let’s try to do that!”The full interview appears in this week’s ZOO, on sale NOW!
http://news.yahoo.com/da-mom-accused-murder-lied-other-kids-201044858.html	DA: Mom accused of murder lied about other kids	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) — A woman accused of killing her 5-year-old son by poisoning him with salt through a feeding tube falsely claimed in the past that she had two other children and a fiance, a prosecutor said Thursday.Assistant District Attorney Doreen Lloyd said the man and the children "never existed."Lloyd told Westchester County Judge Richard Molea she wants to use the alleged lies as evidence against the mother, Lacey Spears of Scottsville, Kentucky. Spears has pleaded not guilty to charges of depraved murder and manslaughter in the January death of Garnett-Paul Spears.The boy died at Westchester Medical Center when his sodium levels rose to dangerous levels with no medical explanation, prosecutors said. They believe his mother, who was sharing his hospital room, administered sodium through the stomach tube.Spears, originally from Decatur, Alabama, was living in the New York suburbs at the time.Lloyd did not detail the circumstances of Spears' statements about having a family. But she said the prosecution wants to use them as evidence of "prior bad acts." They could be used to attack Spears' credibility at trial.View gallery Lacey Spears enters the Westchester County Courthouse for a hearing on Thursday, Dec. 11, 2014 in Wh …Lloyd said the prosecution also has new evidence that Garnett's sodium levels were high once before, at an Alabama hospital.Spears' lawyers would not comment.A judge would have to decide on the admissibility of new evidence, and Molea scheduled a pretrial hearing for Jan. 26. Another judge has already ruled that a key piece of evidence — a bag prosecutors believe was used to hold the salt — was legally obtained.For several years before Garnett's death, Spears kept friends around the country updated on her son's frequent hospitalizations by using Facebook, Twitter, MySpace and a blog.Some experts have suggested that Spears may have Munchausen by proxy, a disorder in which caretakers purposely but secretly harm children and then enjoy the attention and sympathy.However, the defense has not raised the condition as a defense and has asked that prosecutors not be allowed to mention it.
http://autos.yahoo.com/news/chrysler-300-jeep-grand-cherokee-hellcat-could-happen-143014233.html	Chrysler 300 and Jeep Grand Cherokee Hellcat — Could They Happen?	So, Ram Trucks CEO Bob Hegbloom has come out and said there are no plans for a Ram 1500 Hellcat “yet” because the brand has other areas with “big opportunities.” (Maybe a production version of the Rumble Bee concept?) But that makes us wonder, what other contenders are there for the Hellcat treatment?Two that jump to mind are the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Chrysler 300. After all, a refreshed Chrysler 300 is being introduced at the Los Angeles Auto Show later this month.RELATED: See more photos of the 2014 Chrysler 300 SRTBoth make a lot of sense. A Jeep Grand Cherokee Hellcat would be a beast that would vanquish anything Range Rover could throw at it. Even the Porsche Cayenne GTS would be left in its wake.Some might scoff at the 300 Hellcat (imagined in a bad Photoshop creation above) because it would be too close to the Charger Hellcat. But, what if Chrysler finally gave us a Hellcat with AWD? OK, the Charger’s only been out for like a week-and-a-half so saying “finally” sounds ridiculous but just think of the handling possibilities of a 300 AWD Hellcat.RELATED: See 2014 Grand Cherokee SRT PhotosSure, the thinking at Fiat Chrysler is Dodge is the performance brand. And, it probably makes no economic sense, but what would it hurt to make a few just to test the waters? A 300 AWD Hellcat could sell well globally too.__________________________________________________For More, Follow BoldRide on Twitter and Sign up for our Newsletter

For instance, if you’re staring at your coworker’s shirt and thinking to yourself, “Wow, that shirt is really ugly,” you’re probably not going to announce your opinion if someone asks you what you think.There are other rules of proper etiquette that supersede the honestly policy, and it’s better to tone it down and perhaps simply say, “I think you look much better in light colors” or something to that effect.In the workplace, there will be times when it’s not in your best interest to tell the brutally honest truth, especially when dealing with your superiors. Not only do you have to refrain from coming across as coarse, but you also have to find the balance between revealing need-to-know information, avoid revealing too much information, and remaining completely professional.Of course, you should first and foremost follow any and all rules set forth by your employer, as well as any applicable labor laws. But there are a lot of topics that fall into grey areas, remaining unanswered by most handbooks. Check out our list of some of the things you should never admit to your employer.
http://tv.yahoo.com/blogs/tv-news/the-flash-recap-plastique-055721983.html	The Flash' Introduces 3 New Villains to Central City	Grant Gustin as The Flash (The CW)Warning: This recap contains storyline and character spoilers for this week's episode of The Flash.Hungry for supervillains? This week's The Flash has three — though only two survive to be future threats to Barry Allen. Plastique and General Eiling are usually found in the pages of Captain Atom, but the last one, Gorilla Grodd, is a Flash character through and through.One thing you can't blame The Flash for: They don't skimp on the supervillains. Maybe it's a reaction to the negative fan response to the first season of Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., or maybe it's just they realize that, with nearly 75 years of print history, it is absolutely impossible for them to run out of comic book characters.In the show's continuity, Plastique (Kelly Frye) comes to Central City to confront Dr. Harold Hadley, who subjected her to horrible experiments to give her the power to turn anything she touches into a high explosive. Hadley ran the experiments on behalf of General Eiling (Clancy Brown), who's willing to go to any lengths to create super soldiers to protect the country.Clancy Brown as Gen. Wade Eiling on 'The Flash' (The CW)Barry, originally thinking Plastique has a villainous streak, discovers that she's only looking for a way to get rid of her powers. He whisks her away from Eiling's assault team and back to S.T.A.R. Labs, where she finds out her powers are actually the result of the particle accelerator explosion.She hopes Dr. Wells, along with Cisco and Caitlin, can cure her, though Wells tells her that the technology to do that hasn't been invented yet (in that ominous "I'm from the future" voice of his).Related: Get Up to Speed With Our Recaps of 'The Flash'What Wells does tell her is, as a soldier, her responsibility isn't to the military anymore. It's to the metahumans of Central City that the General is hunting down. "Those people are your flock now," says Wells. "You know your duty, Sergeant. Kill Eiling."She fails to kill him; instead, she's shot by Eiling. Her body begins glowing and Barry has to get her body out into the ocean before it blows. To do so, he has to run fast enough to walk on water, which, says Caitlin, "puts you in pretty interesting company."Danielle Panabaker as Caitlin Snow on 'The Flash' (The CW)Of course, while all of this is going on, Barry still finds himself having to deal with Iris chasing "The Streak" for her blog. The attempts he and Joe have made to get her to stop pursuing the story haven't had any effect, so Barry comes to her as The Flash to ask again. It turns out that Iris has been following him to prove Barry's lifelong obsession with the impossible wasn't crazy.The problem is, neither Barry nor Joe have given her an actual reason why she should quit. Belatedly, Barry tries to tell her (as himself, this time) that he's put his parent's death behind him — so her blog hurts his feelings, or something. Frankly, it's too little, too late. He decides to end their friendship, unable to tell her his secret or even why she shouldn't pursue blogging about the Streak.Candice Patton as Iris West on 'The Flash' (The CW)Meanwhile, more of Dr. Wells's secrets are revealed. Five years earlier, he broke off his association with General Eiling because the experiments the military man demanded were too cruel. Apparently, he was trying to develop "enhanced gene therapies" for soldiers to develop mind-reading techniques. This only sounds crazy until you find out that the experiments were being conducted on a gorilla, and you realize that a mind-reading gorilla is crazy, and gene therapies are kind of normal by comparison.In the comics, The General is a continual threat, pursuing various means of creating super soldiers, even before having his mind transferred into an enormous, near-indestructible body. It's likely that Clancy Brown will be back before too long, trying to capture Flash for experimentation.Photos: 48 Comic Book Characters Coming to TV This FallAs for Gorilla Grodd: In the Flash pilot, there's a brief glimpse of a shattered cage with the "Grodd" nameplate hanging from it, so he's out there somewhere and has to be making an appearance soon. Like the comics, this Gorilla Grodd probably possesses some form of telepathy. Will he have the telekinesis as well? The super-strength and super-intelligence? Or the desire to take over the world? Fingers crossed we get all of it.Next week: We meet Girder, another member of the Rogues. He's not the Absorbing Man, but they probably both go to the same CGI effects house.The Flash airs Tuesdays at 8 p.m. on The CW.
http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/land-use/lawsuits-reveal-a-developer-trick-for-getting-big-projects-together/	Lawsuits Reveal a Developer Trick for Assembling Big Projects	Photo by Jamie Scott Lytle Accretive Investments is the developer of Lilac Hills Ranch.Years into its effort to build Lilac Hills Ranch, a 1,700-home development in rural Valley Center, the project’s developer found itself in a lawsuit with one of its consultants.Accretive Investments had been pushing to build the project on 600 acres reserved for farmland for seven years. Getting permission to build all those homes meant getting an exception to the county’s general plan – a blueprint to handle long-term growth.In April 2012, the consultant, Hunsaker and Associates, sued Accretive, arguing it had been abruptly fired with an unpaid bill over $100,000. Accretive responded in kind, suing Hunsaker for intentionally undermining the project.The dispute offers a peek behind the curtain at how major developments like Lilac Hills often come together.In an attempt to make sure it got paid, Hunsaker took out a lien, a legal filing that would restrict the properties until Hunsaker was paid, on some of the properties it had worked on for the developer.Accretive had purchased or entered into development agreements on more than 60 separate properties to piece together Lilac Hills. Hunsaker sent notices of its lien to these property owners, disclosing all the properties Accretive had evaluated as part of the project – and the company hadn’t publicly disclosed all of their plans yet.That was confidential information, Accretive said, and hurt the company’s negotiating position.Accretive bought or optioned all the property for Lilac Hills Ranch using LLCs and LPs – business structures with lower legal and financial risk – with more than 20 different names. Sometimes the company would strike an agreement using the name Covey Creek LP, other times as Birdsong Hills LP and others still as Macademia Groves LP. But in all those cases, the company buying or entering into a development agreement was Accretive.Developers often do this – conduct transactions with companies that don’t bear their name – so land owners can’t figure out the offer in front of them is part of larger development plan, said Tom Muller, a law professor at UCLA.“At the beginning, they disguise who they are,” said Robert Feldman, also a law professor at UCLA. “They don’t want people to know that one group is trying to buy everything. They don’t want people to raise prices because they know they are a missing piece. ”If the individual property owners knew the developer was looking to assemble a bunch of properties, they’d have leverage to raise their asking priceIt’s also a good way to spread out responsibility for debts, lawsuits and other issues in case something goes wrong. For example, Accretive is suing a family that owns property in the Lilac Hills area, alleging the family’s septic tank polluted a nearby creek bed. The family says the lawsuit is an attempt to bully them into signing their property over. The lawsuit against the Hernandez family was filed by Shirey Falls LP. (Shirey happens to be the name of the road the Hernandezes live on, a road Accretive wants access to.) This means that Accretive is only risking the properties or finances held by that LP, and the whole project wouldn’t be on the line if they have to pay damages in court.It’s a common practice in large developments. Multiple experts said it was perfectly legal and considered a good business practice. Sometimes investors even demand it.“Everything we do, we do in a thoughtful way, including how we manage and maintain property,” said Randy Goodson, Accretive’s CEO.This article relates to: Land Use, Lilac Hills Ranch, Must Reads Tags: Accretive Investments, Lilac Hills, Lilac Hills Ranch, North County, Valley CenterStay up-to-date on stories like this.

http://www.aol.com/article/2014/11/21/house-gop-sues-administration-over-health-care-law/20997374/	House GOP sues administration over health care law	WASHINGTON (AP) - House Republicans sued the Obama administration on Friday over its implementation of President Barack Obama's health care law, saying he had overstepped his legal authority in carrying out the program.GOP lawmakers filed the lawsuit in federal district court in Washington the morning after Obama announced unilateral executive actions to expand protections for millions of immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally. While Republicans complained that Obama had unconstitutionally exceeded his powers with those actions, the suit filed Friday did not address immigration."If this president can get away with making his own laws, future presidents will have the ability to as well," Boehner said in a written statement announcing the lawsuit. "The House has an obligation to stand up for the Constitution, and that is exactly why we are pursuing this course of action."The House authorized the lawsuit in a near party-line vote in July as congressional re-election campaigns were heating up. Democrats said Obama had acted legally and said the GOP measure was a political stunt aimed at motivating conservatives to vote and distracting them from calls by some to go even further and impeach the president. The lawsuit was filed Friday against the departments of Health and Human Services and the Treasury.It accuses Obama of unlawfully delaying the health care law's requirement that many employers provide health care coverage for their workers.It also accuses him of illegally making $175 billion in payments to insurance companies from a federal account that is not authorized for that purpose.Congressional Republicans have all opposed the health care overhaul. The GOP-led House has voted over 50 times to repeal it or pare it back.
http://motorsportstalk.nbcsports.com/2014/12/21/highway-to-hellcat-owner-wrecks-707-hp-dodge-challenger-one-hour-after-buying-it/	UPDATED – Highway to Hell(cat): Owner wrecks 707-hp Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat one hour after buying it	(Photo courtesy Facebook via MotorAuthority.com)UPDATE 3 (Dec. 24): We refrained from identifying the driver of the first Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat to be wrecked — mainly because we didn’t want to embarrass him. Honestly, we really do feel bad for him and what happened. But the Colorado State Patrol recently released a report on the Dec. 19 mishap that totaled the $60,000 hot rod, including identifying the driver, so we felt obligated, as the late Paul Harvey used to say, to tell “the rest of the story.” Here it is:Colorado State Patrol statement: “The 2015 Dodge Challenger Hellcat driver, 34-year-old Lance Utley of Winter Park, CO, was traveling northbound on Riverdale Rd. The driver lost control to the right, then overcorrected and lost control to the left, and struck a tree head on. There were two additional occupants in the vehicle. The driver was charged with careless driving. Drugs or alcohol were not involved. There was no mention of excessive speeding. All three occupants were unhurt.”To date, Utley has not commented to the media about his mishap. Really, Lance, we do feel bad for you.UPDATE 2 (Dec. 22): According to TFLCar.com, the crash occurred in Brighton, Colorado, a town of about 35,000, near the South Platte River in Adams County, just northeast of Denver.When MotorSportsTalk contacted the Brighton Police late Sunday afternoon, they had no details of the wreck.The road, according to the TFLCar.com report, is a twisting and winding two-lane road in a semi-rural area that includes crests and dips. The speed limit is posted 40 mph. Police are investigating, but the weather and road conditions were reportedly clear at the time and it’s not known if speed was a factor or not.Here’s part of TFLCar.com’s report: “The skid marks at the scene of the accident show that the driver was traveling north. As the car crested the blind hill, the road drops down to the right, and the Hellcat may have been in a slight drift. The road is very narrow, but in good condition, well marked, and with a posted 40 MPH speed limit sign. The car started to drift toward the right ditch after the speed limit sign. The driver tried to correct, but the resulting over-correction sent the car across the lane and into a large cottonwood (tree). Thankfully, there was no oncoming traffic at this moment.”To add insult to injury, the report claims the wrecked car was the FIRST such Challenger SRT Hellcat sold in Colorado. There has been no identification of who was driving the vehicle.Click here for the story from TFLCar.com, including additional photos of the scene and the wrecked car.UPDATE 1 (Dec. 22):  According to AutoEvolution.com, the National Highway Traffic Safety Association just released a report this past week on the crash-worthiness of the base model version of the Challenger (about $40,000 cheaper than the Hellcat, but built on the same platform). The result: a 4-star, top-of-the-line safety rating. We bet the Hellcat owner in question is sure glad about that now.INITIAL STORY FOLLOWS:You knew it was bound to happen, sooner or later.We just didn’t think it would be THAT soon.When Dodge announced the $60,000 Challenger SRT Hellcat and Charger SRT Hellcat earlier this year – with 707 horsepower motors that make them the most powerful stock muscle cars on the streets of America today – it was almost inevitable what might happen when someone would push one to … and past … its limits.Unfortunately, a motorist in Colorado found that lesson out the hard way, according to a great story on MotorAuthority.com.The Challenger, which has a reported top speed of 204 mph, has only been in dealer showrooms for about a month.This is where the story gets, as Arte Johnson used to say on the 1960s TV show “Laugh In,” “Veerrrryyyy interesting.”So, apparently an unnamed individual walks into a dealer’s showroom, signs on the dotted line and drives off with a brand new, bright neon lime green Challenger Hellcat.The proud new owner’s beautiful car lasted about an hour, according to MotorAuthority’s Viknesh Vijayenthiran, whose work we always enjoy.Check out Viknesh’s original story at MotorAuthority.com.Details about the identity of the owner or where exactly the crash occurred in the Mile-High state are sketchy.But the above picture tells 1,000 words.No, make that 10,000 words — and half of those are probably the owner cussing himself out.From what MotorAuthority.com surmised, the driver lost control, “skidded off the road near a bend and crashed head-on into a tree.”Thankfully, the report said, no one was seriously injured.(Well, at least that proves how crash-worthy the new Hellcats are, right?)What a 2015 Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat looks like in its non-crashed form.The same can’t be said about the car, which is apparently a total loss. Like Humpty Dumpty, all the king’s horses and all the king’s men – and probably the best mechanics and body shops in the biz – can’t put Humpty Hellcat back together again.Considering a Hellcat has just about 40 less horsepower than a 2015 Sprint Cup ride (under NASCAR’s new horsepower reduction rules), it goes without saying that it’s powerful.In fact, you need TWO keys to operate a Hellcat, either the Challenger or Charger version.The first key is to allow you to use the first 500 horsepower in the motor.The second key activates all 707 horses.MotorAuthority.com said of the Hellcat’s power:“We’ve driven the new Challenger SRT Hellcat and found that it delivers performance that will leave even those used to powerful cars awestruck, so this sad sight serves as an important reminder for buyers of such cars to always factor in their own skills and consider whether the cost of a performance driving course should be included in their price estimations.”We couldn’t have said it better.Follow me @JerryBonkowski

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/fbi-may-made-embarrassing-mistake-231915910.html	The FBI May Have Made An Embarrassing Mistake While Investigating The Sony Hack	Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP Wolf Blitzer A confidential bulletin sent by the FBI to companies across the US warning of further cyberattacks by the Sony hackers may have been based on fake posts and messages created by a prankster.Earlier today we reported that the FBI sent a bulletin on Dec. 24 that warned companies of further threats made by the Guardians of Peace hacker gang. That's the group that targeted Sony Pictures, but the FBI warned that it was threatening a media organization as well.A cached PasteBin post revealed the threat the FBI was referring to was targeting CNN, and even included a reference to anchor Wolf Blitzer. Here's the post that the FBI was referring to in its bulletin:By GOP The result of investigation by CNN is so excellent that you might have seen what we were doing with your own eyes. We congratulate you success. CNN is the BEST in the world.You will find the gift for CNN at the following address. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiRacdl02w4 Enjoy!P.S. You have 24 hours to give us the Wolf.But hours after the story published, a journalist who writes about cybersecurity stepped forward and claimed that he wrote the threat to CNN as a prank, copying another message that he found online and simply swapping some of the words.Mediaite reports that David Garrett Jr., a writer for Homeland Security Examiner, took to Twitter and posted screenshots which appear to show that he was the author of the threat to CNN.Here's one of the posts that Garrett offered up as proof that he was behind the message:It's important to note that there's no proof that the PasteBin post mentioning CNN was a prank. Neither Garrett nor the FBI has posted definitive evidence about the threat. The FBI issued the following statement to Business Insider when asked about the Dec. 24 bulletin:As part of our commitment to public safety, the FBI routinely shares information with the private sector and law enforcement community. We take all threats seriously and will continue to disseminate relevant information observed during the course of our investigations, in order to help protect the public against any potential threats.But if Garrett is to be believed, then the FBI may have been fooled by a simple prank. If the FBI published a security bulletin based on anonymous and unauthenticated internet posts, that's going to make it more difficult for people to believe its other claims.Along with the threat against CNN, the FBI also mentioned another PasteBin post that mocked the bureau's own investigation. If the prankster is to be believed, that second post could also be fake.Some security experts have cast doubt on the FBI's claim that North Korea was behind the hack of Sony Pictures. If the FBI has been fooled by an online prankster, that could make its claim that North Korea ordered the hack more difficult to believe.More From Business InsiderThe Sony Hackers Are Now Threatening CNN!

http://news.yahoo.com/motorist-kills-mountain-lion-busy-california-freeway-030254177.html	Motorist kills mountain lion on busy California freeway	By EMMETT BERGSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A motorist struck and killed a mountain lion on a Northern California freeway during Friday's morning rush hour in what authorities described as an unusual traffic accident involving the reclusive cat.The driver struck the mountain lion on a stretch of freeway in the San Francisco suburb of San Bruno and sped away, apparently unaware of what happened, said California Highway Patrol Officer Daniel Hill."It was exceedingly rare to see an animal of this size and an uncommon location to see it," Hill said of the busy and developed area where the cat had wandered.The solitary and elusive mountain lion lives in mountainous or heavily vegetated areas and generally tries to avoid humans, according to state wildlife experts.A patrol unit that responded to the scene determined the animal was dead before dragging it to the side of the roadway for retrieval by wildlife managers, Hill said."We alerted the public on this because it was an unusual location," Hill said. He added that in the dark or low light, it is possible for motorists to fail to see something in the roadway, even with headlights on.(Editing by Victoria Cavaliere and Mohammad Zargham)

View all 20 photosCarrie Underwood is having a difficult pregnancy. It isn't hard on Underwood. Instead it is difficult for Miranda Lambert. According to a Wednesday, Nov. 12 report by The Epoch Times, Miranda Lambert desperately wants a baby of her own.Photo by Larry Busacca/Getty ImagesIt has reported that the reason Miranda Lambert is so desperate to get pregnant is because her marriage to country music superstar and star of “The Voice,” Blake Shelton, is crumbling. The country music super couple have been having severe difficulties for quite a while. Lambert thinks that getting pregnant and having a baby will save her marriage.Blake Shelton has vehemently denied that he and Miranda Lambert are not happily married. He stated many times that their marriage is solid. Despite that, the rumors are still circulating that they are on the verge of a divorce.Watching Carrie Underwood prepare for baby is not easy for Miranda Lambert. It has been reported that she believes a baby is the only way to salvage her marriage. With Shelton and Lambert spending so much time apart, while he films “The Voice” and while she is touring or recording, their marriage may very well be strained and the chance of getting pregnant slim.Adding to the alleged problems with marriage, it didn't help matters when Blake Shelton announced on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” that they would not be having a baby. At the time of publication, it was unknown if Shelton had changed his mind about starting a family. If he has, Miranda Lambert may becoming a mother sooner than expected.Fans of both Miranda Lambert and Blake Shelton are hoping that their marriage is not on the rocks. They do not want to see the couple divorce. Fans are probably in favor of Lambert and Shelton having a baby, just not to save their marriage.

The Voice wrapped up its seventh season a couple of weeks ago with a star-studded finale. Many of those guest singers are currently trending on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. As of now, all four finalists on The Voice have joined them.Craig Wayne Boyd, who won The Voice, is off to a great start. His single, “My Baby’s Got A Smile On Her Face,” is currently sitting in the #1 spot on Billboard’s Hot Country Singles chart.Adding to the impressive achievement is the fact that the Voice winner is only the second country music act to debut on the chart at number one. Previously, only Garth Brooks managed to do this with “More Than a Memory” in 2007.Boyd has also made his debut on Billboard’s Hot 100 singles chart. This former Voice contestant officially bowed in at #34.Interestingly enough, Craig is not the only contestant from The Voice to debut on the Hot 100 chart this week. At #74 is Voice contestant Damien Lawson with his solo effort “Soldier.” Damien’s fellow Team Adam member Chris Jamison is currently sitting at #54 with “Velvet.”Although Voice winner Boyd made the Top 40, only one other Voice contestant managed to crack Billboard’s Top 20.The Voice finalist Matt McAndrew made his debut on the Hot 100 chart at #13 with “Wasted Love”.Apparently, this is the best a Voice contestant has ever done on the Billboard chart. The continued dominant showing by a non-winning Voice finalist may only fan the flames of skepticism about the organic nature of how winners are chosen on the NBC series.Both McAndrew and teammate Jamison feature again in the list with duets sung with Voice coach Adam Levine: “Lost Stars” at #83 and “Lost Without U” at #63, respectively.All debates and tinfoil hatters aside, this post-Voice finale turn of events seems to signal that the seventh season did indeed possess a very strong group of finalists.There’s no question that these young men all have the potential to make popular music. If they didn’t, their original Voice songs would have each missed the top of Billboard’s chart by some distance.Hopefully, this will aid non-winning Voice finalists in their quest to negotiate lucrative record deals. These charting singles also may be the first real proof that fans of The Voice have been gifted that anyone from this season has a real chance at stardom.Between the amazing feats achieved by both Voice winner Boyd and Voice finalist McAndrew, it seems like this season of The Voice might reveal itself to have the most break-out stars within its ranks.[Image Credit: The Voice Official Twitter]

He says he asked his 15-year-old son to hold his beer cup while he did so.Seconds later, two undercover officers with the Arizona Department of Liquor Licenses and Control approached him. Coulter says they told him that what he did was illegal and that he could be arrested for it. In the end, officers escorted the father and son out of the University of Phoenix Stadium.Officials say Coulter is lucky he was able to walk away from the situation."Providing alcohol to an underage person or an underage person in possession of alcohol is a Class 1 misdemeanor," said Sgt. Wesley Kuhl of the Arizona Department of Liquor License and Control. "The consequences could be up to, and this is a maximum, of two years in jail, $2,500 fine and three years probation."***PHOTOS: Best of the NFL preseason

Fans will be happy to know that the music icon is returning to the show and will be featured in its upcoming season!During a recent interview with The Huffington Post, LaBelle recalled a conversation she had with co-creator, Lee Daniels, who wants the legendary singer to try something “daring” on camera for her season two appearance.“We talked about it about three months ago. He said ‘LaLa,’ -- he calls me ‘LaLa’ -- ‘would you take your wig off?’ I said, ‘Hell no,’" LaBelle explained, laughing. “So he’s trying to do something daring with me, but I ain’t going out like that. I love you Lee, but no, no. Viola Davis did it well on ‘How To Get Away With Murder,’ but not Ms. Patti. I can’t do it.”Davis’ powerful wig removal scene was welcomed with praise, making it one of the most memorable  -- and celebrated -- moments in recent primetime television.As LaBelle awaits the filming of her second appearance on "Empire," she is also prepping the release of her debut Jazz album. According to LaBelle, the 13-track opus, which is currently untitled, is tentatively set for a late 2015 release and will feature rendition songs by Nina Simone (“Wild Is the Wind”), Frank Sinatra (“Softly As I Leave You”), and Gloria Lynne (“The Folks That Live On The Hill”) among others. Incorporating classic music into her new recordings is something that LaBelle loves to do, and is thrilled that newer singers do the same. “I’m very happy to hear some of the young singer’s going back to old school, like Tyrese, Jill [Scott], and Johnny Gill,” she said. “They’re singing songs like they used to be sung -- with basic R&B chord changes and basic stories.”In recent years, veteran artists including Eddie Levert have expressed their thoughts on R&B singers "taking the romance out" out of the genre and leaving "nothing to the imagination." However, LaBelle has seen improvement -- she even performs modern ballads at her shows.  “They’re not disgusting, they’re not vulgar. I include some these songs in my shows now -- I do ‘Shame’ by Tyrese and Johnny Gill’s ‘Game Changer’ and Charlie Wilson’s ‘Goodnight Kisses.’ I also love Jill Scott’s new project, so there’s hope.”Here's to R&B's refined "New Attitude!"
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/11/09/alaska-storm-pushing-cold-air-toward-lower-us/20990884/	Alaska storm pushing cold air toward lower US	A massive storm expected to help push Arctic air toward the lower 48 states was moving slowly eastward after blasting parts of Alaska's Aleutian chain with hurricane-force winds.The tempest fueled by the remnants of Typhoon Nuri was forecast to play a role in generating a high-pressure system that will allow frigid air to blanket the central plains, starting with eastern Montana and the Dakotas on Sunday. The frigid temperatures are expected to spill south into the central plains on Monday.The system was centered 220 miles northwest of Adak in the Aleutian chain, David Kochevar, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said early Sunday."It's slowly dissipating over the Bering Sea," he said.Its strongest winds had diminished considerably and were recorded at just 45 mph in Adak and Shemya Island, Kochevar said.The storm peaked Friday with sustained winds of 70 mph and gusts up to 96 mph on Shemya, forecasters said.The weakened storm was only expected to bring gale-force winds to the Alaska mainland's southwestern coast, typical for this time of year, said NWS meteorologist Shaun Baines."The worst conditions were out where there's no people," he said Saturday.On Shemya Island, 120 civilian contractors staff an early warning radar installation for the U.S. military.Eareckson Air Station on the island 1,500 miles southwest Anchorage suffered minor facility damage, Alaskan Command public affairs officer Tommie Baker said.The corners of a roof were bent back and some dumpsters moved around, but no roof was torn off and the dumpters didn't slam into any vehicles or buildings, Baker said. Workers locked themselves inside to wait out the storm.Workers had yet to conduct a full assessment of damage around the entire island, Baker said. But workers there are accustomed to extreme weather, including 100-mile winds. The community averages six weather-related lockdowns a year.The storm surpassed the intensity of 2012's Superstorm Sandy as measured by pressure, but a lack of measuring stations in the remote region means meteorologists didn't have much more data. Sandy caused at least 182 deaths and $65 billion in damage on the East Coast. Nuri, in contrast, hit a sparsely populated region with just a few small communities where people are accustomed to severe weather.The high-pressure system Nuri will help create is expected to send temperatures plunging across a wide swathe of the lower 48 states. High temperatures were forecast to be below freezing on Tuesday across much of Wyoming to Minnesota and parts of Iowa, said Bruce Sullivan of the National Weather Service's prediction center.The high in Great Falls, Montana, is expected to be 7 degrees, Sullivan said. By Wednesday, high temperatures will struggle to get out of the low 30s in the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles, he said."Once it gets its momentum going, it's going to keep going south," Sullivan said.Destruction of Hurricane Sandy:
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/12/13/prosecutor-releases-more-ferguson-documents/21115950/	Prosecutor releases more Ferguson documents	A prosecutor released hundreds of pages of additional documents Saturday from the investigation into the police shooting of Michael Brown, including an interview transcript of a friend who initially asserted that he had seen Brown get shot in the back.St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch said the newly released records were inadvertently excluded from the thousands of pages of other documents made public Nov. 24, when a grand jury decided not to charge Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson for killing Brown.The freshly publicized documents include a transcript of an interview of Brown's friend Dorian Johnson conducted by the FBI and county police just four days after the Aug. 9 confrontation in which the white officer shot the black 18-year-old. Previously released forensic evidence showed that Brown was not shot in the back but was struck by bullets in the head, chest and arm.Johnson's account to investigators was generally similar to his later grand jury testimony, in which he portrayed Wilson as the aggressor during a struggle that began at the officer's vehicle and led to a brief chase before Brown's fatal shooting.In both his original interview and his Sept. 10 grand jury testimony, which was previously released, Johnson said that Wilson reached out of his vehicle window toward Brown's throat or shirt. During the ensuring struggle, Johnson said he never saw Brown touch Wilson's gun.Wilson told grand jurors that Brown grabbed ahold of his weapon and twisted it toward the officer's leg. The officer eventually fired his gun from inside the vehicle. Forensic evidence showed that Brown's hand was shot at close range. Brown and Johnson then ran.In his August interview, Johnson initially was adamant that he had seen Johnson get shot in the back while running."It definitely struck him in his back," Johnson said, later adding: "It caused him to stop."Asked by a detective how he knew Brown had been shot in the back, Johnson replied: "If it would've missed him, or if he wouldn't have felt it, I believe he would've kept runnin."Under further questioning, Johnson later acknowledged that he didn't see a bullet hit Brown's back, but he remained adamant that Brown's back was toward Wilson when he fired a shot.By almost all witness accounts, Brown turned at some point to face the officer.Johnson described Brown's hands as being raised, one higher than the other. Wilson told grand jurors that one of Brown's hands was clenched in a fist and the other at his waist as Brown began charging back at Wilson.As with the previously released grand jury documents, the witness transcripts released Saturday varied in their accounts of Brown's hands. One witness said Brown's "hands kinda went up." Another said Brown's hands were up briefly but he then ran toward Wilson. Another said Brown threw up his hands and said something that sounded like, "Don't kill me."Among the documents released Saturday was a witness list, with all of the names of the witnesses whited out. It shows that 62 people testified before the grand jury between Aug. 20 and Nov. 21, including some who appeared multiple times. Some of the people interviewed by federal authorities did not testify before the grand jury.McCulloch apologized in a written statement for any confusion that may have occurred by failing to initially release all of the interview transcripts. He said he believes he has now released all of the grand jury evidence, except for photos of Brown's body and anything that could lead to witnesses being identified.
http://news.yahoo.com/white-florida-deputy-shoots-black-man-witnesses-had-004052289.html	White Florida deputy shoots black man who witnesses say had hands up	By Barbara ListonORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - A Florida sheriff called for calm after a 28-year-old unarmed black man in a stolen car was shot and critically wounded early on Monday by a white officer, after witness reports that the man had his hands up and amid racially charged protests nationwide about police violence."I ask everyone to not rush to judgment and allow the investigation to be completed," Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said at a news conference in Orlando.Demings, who himself is African American and was surrounded by six religious leaders from the black community, said investigators have found some eyewitness accounts that conflict with that of the officer involved.Witnesses at the apartment complex said that the men had their hands up when the deputy opened fire, according to local media reports.Cities across the United States have seen major protests in recent days after grand juries declined to indict anyone in the deaths of two unarmed black men at the hands of white police officers in New York and Ferguson, Missouri.After locating a stolen car at an apartment complex just after midnight on Monday, Sergeant Robert McCarthy fired three shots, one of which hit Cedric Bartee.Demings said Bartee failed to comply with McCarthy's commands and "made extensive furtive movements," making the deputy fear for his safety.Bartee underwent surgery and was in stable but critical condition late in the afternoon, the sheriff said. A second man in the car was arrested unhurt.The shooting also comes only a few days after a 32-year-old Latino man was shot and killed in a car by an Orlando detective investigating a burglary. Police said the detective opened fire after he saw Alejandro Noel Cordero had a gun.On Monday Demings said he was trying to be transparent in holding the press conference "because of the backdrop of everything happening in the country at this time."He added: "It's concerning to me" how the public might react.Bartee had a history of arrests on at least 45 charges since 1999, according to a list provided by the sheriff, but the deputy was not aware of his background at the time of the shooting, Demings said.McCarthy has been reassigned to administrative duties for at least a week, and the shooting is being investigated by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement as part of a standard procedure. The FDLE is also investigating Cordero's shooting.(Editing by David Adams and Eric Walsh)
http://www.ibtimes.com/hackers-release-thousands-amazon-xbox-live-hulu-plus-passwords-1767908	Hackers Release Thousands Of Amazon, Xbox Live and Hulu Plus Passwords	A group of self-described hackers released thousands of passwords and credit card numbers from online services like Amazon, Hulu Plus, Xbox Live and the PlayStation Network on Friday. The group claimed to be aligned with the loosely knit group of “hacktivists” called “Anonymous.”The information was released in a document posted on text storage service Ghostbin. It was inactive early on Saturday morning. The list included over 10,000 entries, including retailers like Walmart and Dell, video game services like EA Games, Origin.com and Twitch.TV, as well as login information for a number of subscription pornography sites like Brazzers.com. Credentials for online services for VPNCyberGhost and UFC TV were also listed.Update: CyberGhost has responded with a statement: "The group just published a list of [promotional] activation keys for our service. Anybody could do that, because we give these keys away for free. The keys are all blocked... [so] this is not a loss for us and [not a] security vulnerability for our users."Update 2: The Twitter account claimed on Monday, Dec. 29 that it had "reposted" account details it leaked over the past two years, following up on criticism that the leak was fake. The disclosure means that most, if not all, of the accounts listed have had their credentials changed since they were originally leaked. The original Ghostbin post has also been removed.The information also included expiration dates, security codes, phone numbers and names for some of the accounts. Amazon, Microsoft, Hulu Plus and Sony did not respond to a request for comment, and the International Business Times could not immediately verify the claims.Xbox Live and PlayStation Network (PSN) were taken down by a denial of service attack launched by the hacking group “Lizard Squad” on Christmas. Microsoft was able to restore access on Friday after Megaupload founder Kim Dotcom offered the group free access to the data storage service, but PlayStation owners were still unable to sign on after midnight on Saturday morning.

But since then, astronomers and engineers devised an ingenious way to repurpose Kepler, whose mission has been to scour the cosmos in search of Earthlike planets.And now, the planet-hunting probe not only has been reborn, but also has discovered a massive exoplanet some 180 light-years away.(Story continues below image.) Artist's rendering of NASA's Kepler spacecraft hunting for planets in its second mission, K2.The planet, HIP 116454b, is a "super Earth" with a diameter 2.5 times the diameter of Earth. It orbits a star a little cooler and smaller than our sun, located in the Pisces constellation. The planet is too close to its star to support life as we know it, according to NASA.Super Earths are in a class of planets that don't exist in our solar system, and HIP 116454b's average density suggests that it is either a watery world (three-fourths water and one-fourth rock) or a planet with a gaseous atmosphere, like a mini-Neptune."The Kepler mission showed us that planets larger in size than Earth and smaller than Neptune are common in the galaxy, yet they are absent in our solar system," Steve Howell, Kepler project scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center, said in a written statement.Since its launch in 2009, Kepler has found nearly 1,000 confirmed Earth-like planets -- and when two of Kepler's gyroscope-like steering wheels failed last year, astronomers devised alternative methods to keep the hunt alive.Scientists at Ball Aerospace in Colorado came up with an idea the Los Angeles Times called "so crazy it just might work." Since light particles from the sun exert enough pressure to push Kepler around, scientists realized they could harness this energy and use it as a "third wheel" to control Kepler. The plan worked.“Like a phoenix rising from the ashes, Kepler has been reborn and is continuing to make discoveries," researcher Andrew Vanderburg, a graduate student at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass., said in a written statement. "Even better, the planet it found is ripe for follow-up studies.”
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeb-bush-black-lives-matter_55cdfee6e4b0ab468d9d02ab	Here's What Really Happened In Jeb Bush's Private 'Black Lives Matter' Meeting	WASHINGTON -- A Las Vegas campaign event for GOP presidential contender Jeb Bush came to a sudden end this week as activists, unhappy with how Bush addressed a question on racial injustice, chanted, "Black Lives Matter."After the confrontation, the Bush campaign said the candidate had privately met with advocates for the movement before the event, an assertion that appeared in multiple articles about the disruption.But that description is misleading, The Huffington Post has learned.There was a meeting, but no activists from the Black Lives Matter movement participated. Instead, Bush met with a local elected official, a GOP lobbyist and a staffer from an anti-poverty organization.Kevin Hooks, president and CEO of the Las Vegas Urban League, told HuffPost he set up the meeting at the Bush campaign's behest. His organization focuses on providing job opportunities for low-income residents. Hooks said that while he respects Bush for reaching out, he would not characterize the people at the meeting as Black Lives Matter activists. "It's a little disingenuous," he said.There were three people at the table with Bush. Hooks confirmed that a member of his staff was one of them. North Las Vegas Mayor Pro Tem Pamela Goynes-Brown was the second, and she said the third attendee was Sean Fellows, a registered lobbyist for a communications firm who once ran as a Republican candidate for state assembly. The Las Vegas Sun once reported that he wore through his New Balances campaigning, and the photo accompanying the article showed him sporting pleated khakis.Fellows did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The Bush campaign did not comment on the list of attendees.The meeting came about after BuzzFeed reported that Black Lives Matter activists might attempt a demonstration at the event, the Bush campaign said. Campaign staff members reached out to Hooks to see if activists wanted to meet with the presidential candidate prior to the event.Hooks told HuffPost that the campaign was earnest in its outreach attempts and willing to talk to anyone, but "people didn't really want to talk to them." The Bush campaign did not comment on whether it stood by its statement that the candidate met with Black Lives Matter advocates. The campaign said that advocates were invited, and couldn't speak to why people might not want to attend.   The private meeting was about fifteen minutes long, according to those who attended. Goynes-Brown told HuffPost that the meeting did not focus on the Black Lives Matter movement, although attendees did discuss criminal justice issues. Goynes-Brown said she strongly supports the movement, but would not call herself an activist.Hooks said his organization brought up the Voting Rights Act and a black man, allegedly armed, who was shot in Ferguson recently. "There was as lot of non-response," Hooks said. HuffPost also spoke to activists from Unity Vegas, a group formed in the wake of the Eric Garner's death. Unity Vegas members questioned Bush at the town hall event, but said they didn't attend the private meeting.Jamie Hall, who supports Black Lives Matter, stood up during the Q&A session and listed statistics about racial disparities in police killings. She asked Bush how he planned to address issues such as the school-to-prison pipeline.    Bush responded that there are "serious problems," and that "there is racism in America, no one should deny that."Tenisha Martin asked Bush, "How do you relate to it?" She told HuffPost that she is a single mom with a teenage son whom she sends out every day, "nervous he may not come home."Bush, visibly annoyed at the interruption, pivoted to discussing his plan for education reform and took no more questions. Jeanne DuBose told HuffPost, "We weren't interrupting; we were listening. And once [Hall] asked her question, that was it. He turned around, he started to walk away," she said. "We stood up and we started chanting, 'Black Lives Matter.' He just ignored that."Attendees described the chant as a spontaneous outbreak. "We weren't happy or satisfied or any of that with his answers," Martin said.Bush is the latest candidate to have a campaign event disrupted by Black Lives Matter advocates. Activists shut down a recent rally for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders in Seattle. Hooks told HuffPost that he was impressed that Bush was willing to go into the "lion's den," and he urged candidates from both sides of the aisle to come back to Las Vegas and speak to the community. The Bush campaign said that it plans to return to the city.But Patrisse Cullors, co-founder of Black Lives Matter, was not impressed. "He lied, or does he not get what's happening? And he thinks he's meeting with people when he's not?" she asked. "Incredible. In-fucking-credible."Ryan Grim contributed reporting.
http://www.voanews.com/content/where-in-world-is-north-korean-leader-kim-jong-un/2477468.html	Where in the World Is Kim Jong Un?	North Korea's 31-year-old supreme leader has not been seen in public in more than month -- at a time when a high-level Pyongyang delegation made a surprise visit to South Korea in an apparent peace initiative.His disappearance from public view has stirred rumors of coups, health problems and even a possible civil war in the Hermit Kingdom.Kim Jong Un, who succeeded his father Kim Jong Il in 2011, was last seen September 3 attending a concert by his favorite pop group, the Moranbong Band, an all-girl group consisting of five young women, all hand-picked by Kim.He was a no-show when the North Korean parliament convened September 26 for its second session of the year. That caught the attention of the media.South Korea's Yonhap News Agency recently quoted a source "familiar with North Korea" as saying Kim suffers from gout -- which runs in the family -- in addition to high cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes, all related to obesity and his fondness for Emmantal cheese.Some observers say that his younger sister, Kim Yo Jong, has stepped in to fill the void. She is the youngest child of Kim Jong Il.Rumors took a more serious turn Saturday when Kim Jong Un's top deputies traveled to South Korea for the highest-level face-to-face talks in five years.The delegation was led by Huwang Pyong So -- believed to be Kim's Number two.With rumors flying, the outside world will get one important clue on the fate of Kim Jong Un on Friday when North Korea mounts its very public ceremonies to mark the founding of the Korean Worker's Party.If the supreme leader fails to show at this must-see event, it could signal he has very serious problems, physical or political.
http://www.theverge.com/2014/12/4/7327013/james-bond-24-full-cast-title-car-release-date	The next James Bond film is called Spectre: new car, poster, and full cast confirmed	The 24th James Bond film now has a name: Spectre, which is set for release in late 2015. Bond fans know Spectre as the global terrorist organization from classic Bond films (the name is an acronym for all things obviously evil: Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge, and Extortion).The name was revealed during a livestreamed announcement event, where director Sam Mendes also revealed the new car (Aston Martin DB10) and full cast. New members include Andrew Scott (who played Moriarty on BBC's Sherlock and will star as Denbigh here), Christoph Waltz (playing a character named Oberhauser — not, as previously rumored, classic villain Blofeld), Dave Bautista, Monica Bellucci, and Léa Seydoux.Shooting locations for the new movie, which begins production tomorrow, include Pinewood London, Mexico City, Rome, Tangier & Erfoud, Morocco, Sölden, Obertilliach, and Lake Altaussee, Austria.2012's Skyfall, released 50 years after the first Bond movie, is the most successful movie of the franchise with over $1.1 billion in worldwide gross receipts (which also makes it the ninth highest-grossing film of all time worldwide).Skyfall's director (Sam Mendes) and screenwriters (John Logan, Neal Purvis, and Robert Wade) have all returned for the new film, as has Daniel Craig in the titular role. According to Mendes, in a Charlie Rose interview from earlier this year, Bond 24 (as it was then called) won't be a direct sequel to Skyfall but will live in the same world — meaning we'll be seeing more of Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris, Rory Kinnear, and Ben Whishaw.Earlier this year, French actress Léa Seydoux (Blue is the Warmest Colour) was confirmed as the new Bond girl, while Christoph Waltz had been cast in an unspecified role (then rumored to be longtime Bond nemesis Ernst Stavro Blofeld). Guardians of the Galaxy's Dave Bautista had been strongly rumored (now confirmed) for the role of Hinx, a henchman that will no doubt laugh every time Bond tries to punch him, before succumbing to Bond's wily antics and use of environmental objects late in the film.Spectre will hit theaters November 6th, 2015.

Ashton Kutcher and Rumer Willis, circa 2009 (Michael Buckner/Getty Images)No hard feelings here! It's been roughly one year since Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore's divorce was finalized (and three years since they announced their split), but Demi's daughter Rumer Willis isn't holding any grudges. In fact, the 26-year-old actress recently revealed that she and her ex-stepfather — who's only 10 years her senior — still talk from time to time.Asked during an interview with Access Hollywood if she and Kutcher still keep in touch, Bruce Willis's eldest daughter didn't miss a beat."Yeah, every once in a while," she admitted. Her most recent communication came after Ashton and his fiancée, Mila Kunis, welcomed their daughter, Wyatt Isabelle, in September."I reached out to him when he had his baby the other day, which is so awesome," Rumer noted before cracking a wistful smile and adding, "She's very cute."The Always Woodstock star also reflected on Ashton's relationship with her mother, and she seems to appreciate the unconventional position he was in."I realized the other day, he was younger than me when he and my mom started going out," she mused. "That would be like me meeting someone who already had three teenage kids — kind of going into that whole situation was crazy."But she doesn't think her mom was crazy for the way she approached her relationship with Kutcher. "I think it was more her going, 'Hey, this is my life and these are my kids and my priorities. So if you want to come and kind of join our crazy clan, this is what I already have kind of built,' which I find so amazing and respectful."She went on to praise both her mom and dad Bruce Willis for their dedication to their family. "It's one of the things that I admire most about my parents, is that they set such an incredible example for kind of putting their children first and keeping a family together, no matter what," she stated.It certainly seems that Rumer has picked up some skills from her folks when it comes to maintaining positive relationships over the years. When asked if she now considered Kutcher a friend, Rumer replied with a simple, "Yeah."In our books, this is a real modern family at its finest.
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/11/11/after-kenneth-bae-release-christian-groups-tread-carefully-in-north-korea/20992260/	After Bae release, Christian groups tread carefully in North Korea	(Reuters) - Christian groups in North Korea are vowing to carry on their missionary work despite mounting risks since Korean-American activist Kenneth Bae was imprisoned two years ago.North Korea and neighboring China have clamped down on the groups' activities recently, and the organizations say that has forced them to become more secretive. Bae's unexpected release has not changed that."We are getting more nervous," said Kim Seung-eun, a missionary for the Caleb Mission, which is based in South Korea's South Chungcheong Province but frequently travels to North Korea. "We have to come up with a strategy to avoid another case like Kenneth Bae's."The North Korean government arrested Bae in November 2012 at a border crossing with a tour group of Christian students, saying he was plotting to bring down the government through "religious activities" by setting up a base for Christian missionaries at a hotel in the northern city of Rason.He was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor but was released on Saturday after diplomatic bargaining. Bae has remained silent on his missionary work and his imprisonment. On Monday, Bae's sister said he would not do interviews.Such reticence is necessary, said one U.S.-based activist, because of the dangers involved in propagating religion, especially in an overt, organized way, in a totalitarian state."If one person is caught, then everyone else can suffer the consequences," said Sam Kim, executive director of the Korean Church Coalition for North Korea Freedom, which is based in Southern California.Although there are four state-operated churches in Pyongyang, which outside groups say are merely for show, religion is ruthlessly suppressed in North Korea, where the only acceptable form of devotion is to the country's ruling family and its supreme leader, Kim Jong-un.Open Doors, a group that monitors religious persecution globally, says North Korea is the worst country to be Christian. It says 70,000 Christians are in labor camps there, though there is no way to corroborate that.The clamp-down on Christian-backed humanitarian organizations along the North Korea-China border has made it harder for activists to aid fleeing North Koreans as they try to make their way to South Korea via China."The people I talk to - the rescuers - say that it's tough right now," said Melanie Kirkpatrick, who has written a history of the "underground railroad," the network that helps people escape from North Korea. Fewer North Koreans are escaping to China, she said.Meanwhile, activists have become more cautious. Said Joy Jung of Cornerstone International Ministry, a missionary organization based in Seoul: "People who are entering North Korea should not reveal themselves as Christians."That view is reinforced by one missionary from Peace Corea, also based in Seoul, who declined to be identified."We tend to be much more careful than before and are trying to find other ways to spread Christianity in North Korea," said the missionary. "Defectors tend to stay quiet on the issue. Even though Kenneth Bae has been released, we are not planning to be more aggressive with our activities from now on."

http://www.voanews.com/content/reu-thai-pm-bemoans-divisive-soap-operas-offer-to-write-better-ones/2463139.html	Thai PM Bemoans Divisive Soap Operas, Offers to Write Better Ones	Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha on Friday criticized television soap operas for promoting violence and division in society and said he wanted scripts to encourage reconciliation. He said he would write them himself if he had to.Prayuth, who is also army chief, staged a coup on May 22, overthrowing an elected government after six months of at times violent anti-government protests.“I have ordered that scripts be written, including plays on reconciliation, on tourism and on Thai culture,” Prayuth told reporters.“They are writing plots at the moment and if they can't finish it I will write it myself,” he said of a team of government-appointed writers.The junta has ruled unchallenged since taking over and has cracked down on pro-democracy dissidents and supporters of the ousted government of Yingluck Shinawatra. It has even warned academics that debate that might “cause misunderstanding” would not be tolerated.Yingluck, Thailand's first woman prime minister, is the sister of ousted former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, a telecoms tycoon who shook up politics by winning over poor voters with populist policies and challenging the royalist establishment.Prayuth bemoaned hugely popular television soap operas which he said encouraged violence rather than peace. Some television dramas have also been criticized for trivializing rape and domestic violence.“In our country, television dramas make people fight and they create divisions so we have much improvement to make in this area,” he said.“I have ordered that scripts be written,” he said. “One plot will be two foreign families come to visit Thailand, they meet each other and come to love each other.”It is not the first time Prayuth, known for his gruff exchanges with reporters, has shown an interest in the arts.The straight-talking general also penned lyrics to a patriotic ballad - “Return Happiness to Thailand” - which is played by radio and television stations around the country.

He reportedly tested negative for the virus despite having been in the throes of infection.We are sorry to announce that the 3rd Ebola patient, Dr. Martin Salia, has passed away as a result of the advanced symptoms of the disease. - Nebraska Medicine (@NebraskaMed) November 17, 2014Salia became infected while treating patients in Sierra Leone, his home country, and became the second person to die of the hemorrhagic fever in America.The U.S. resident's condition was already nearing death when he arrived in Nebraska, officials said.Dr. Salia was suffering from advanced symptoms of Ebola when he arrived on Saturday, which included kidney and respiratory failure. - Nebraska Medicine (@NebraskaMed) November 17, 2014Officials previously announced that Salia was in "extremely critical" condition and late Sunday said it was an "hour-by-hour" situation, according to several reports.He was flown to the same hospital that had previously cured two other Ebola patients.Salia's rapidly declining health can reportedly be attributed to a previous Ebola test coming back negative, according to a Washington Post report.He tested negative for the lethal virus despite being infected, sources told the paper. In an even more tragic turn, those around Salia removed protective gear and embraced him in celebration.It is not known if those people have since become infected.Salia leaves behind a wife and two children aged 16 and 20-years-old, according to the Post. All three live in the U.S.Liberian Thomas Eric Duncan, in October, was the first person to die of Ebola in the U.S. Duncan passed away at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, in Dallas, and also infampously infected to nurses during his stay.Both Nina Pham and Amber Vinson were eventually cured of the virus, but not before being flown to separate hospitals outside Texas.Almost 5,200 people have died of Ebola around the globe, the World Health Organization announced last week.Nearly 15,000 people remain infected, and their ranks are only growing.
http://news.yahoo.com/mystery-object-appears-near-milky-ways-monster-black-133810775.html	Mystery Object Appears Near Milky Way's Monster Black Hole	A mystery object at the center of the galaxy has astronomers scratching their heads, and a new piece of information won't be solving the case before the New Year. In yet another twist to a saga of astronomical proportions, astronomers have identified what they say is a gas cloud that made a tight orbit around the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy 13 years ago. The object could be one in a series of gas clouds, the second of which may soon become a snack for the black hole.The newly discovered object has been dubbed G1. An object known as G2 has been in the news for more than a year, ever since astronomers at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Germany hypothesized that it was a gas cloud. If that is true, it should lose some of its material to the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way (known as Sagittarius A* or Sgr A*). This giant black hole — its name is pronounced Sagittarius A(star) — doesn't dine on material often, so the event would be a rare chance for astronomers to watch a black hole eat. [Top 10 Strangest Things in Space]While the scientists at Max Planck contend that G2 is a gas cloud, a group of researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, led by astrophysicist Andrea Ghez, argue that G2 is more likely a star surrounded by a layer of dust and gas. Over the summer, G2 made its closest approach to the black hole and was not torn apart. Ghez and her group argued that this was a knockout punch for the gas cloud theory — clear evidence that G2 is a solid body. But the researchers at the Max Planck institute countered with an explanation for how G2 could have remained intact even if it is a gas cloud. Their theory incorporates the idea that G2 was once part of a larger gas cloud that subsequently broke up into smaller gas clouds that all follow the same path, like beads on a string. This "beading" of gas has been observed in the universe before. If additional clouds of gas could be identified following the same path as G2, that would strongly indicate that G2 is a gas cloud and not a star, the scientists say.In their newest paper, the Max Planck group provides a computer model that retraces the path of G1. According to their research, G1 followed a path nearly identical to G2. The model does make certain assumptions about G1's motion — for example, that it decelerated near closest approach to the black hole."The good agreement of the model with the data renders the idea that G1 and G2 are part of the same gas streamer highly plausible," Stefan Gillessen, a co-author on the new research, said a statement. The new study was first published on the online preprint journal arXiv.org and has been accepted to the Astrophysical Journal.Follow Calla Cofield @callacofield. Follow us @Spacedotcom, Facebook and Google+.

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/science-says-personality-trait-predicts-184323495.html	Science Says This Personality Trait Predicts Job Performance	Andrew Burton / Getty Conscientious people make connections.The only major personality trait that consistently leads to success is  conscientiousness . "I t's emerging as one of the primary dimensions of successful functioning across the lifespan," Paul Tough writes in "How Children Succeed." "It  really goes cradle to grave in terms of how people do." Tough says that people who test high in conscientiousness get better grades in school and college, commit fewer crimes, and stay married longer.They live longer, too, he says. And not just because they smoke and drink less. They have fewer strokes, lower blood pressure, and a lower incidence of Alzheimer's disease.There's a staggering amount of research linking conscientiousness with success. An Italian study found that conscientiousness predicts academic achievement. A National Institute of Mental Health study found that conscientious men earn higher salaries. The National Institute on Aging also found that conscientiousness is linked to income and job satisfaction. Other studies show that conscientiousness is the most important factor for finding and retaining employment. Taken together, the research suggests that conscientiousness is the personality trait most often correlated with job performance. How do you know if you're conscientious? Conscientious people tend to be super organized, responsible, and plan ahead. They work hard in the face of challenges and can control their impulses. Psychologists classify conscientiousness as one of the "Big 5" personality traits, with the others being agreeableness, extroversion, neuroticism, and openness to experience. The other traits can predict certain workplace outcomes — extroversion is a great fit for highly social gigs like sales and openness to experience often leads to creativity — but  conscientiousness is remarkable for the way it cuts across roles.Research shows that arriving on time, doing thorough work, and being thoughtful toward your colleagues helps people across job functions.  "Being on top of deadlines is almost universally a good thing," one industrial psychologist told us.Moreover, within conscientiousness are the narrower traits of self control and "grit," which University of Pennsylvania  psychologist Angela Duckworth has found to be more integral to children's scholarly success than IQ. Why conscientiousness people are so successful"Highly c onscien tious  employees do a series of things better than the rest of us," says University of Illinois psychologist Brent Roberts, who studies conscientiousness.To start, they're better at goals: setting them, working toward them, and persisting amid setbacks. If a super ambitious goal can't be realized, they'll switch to a more attainable one rather than getting discouraged and giving up. As a result, they tend to achieve goals that are consistent with what employers want. Roberts also owes their success to "hygiene" factors. Conscientious people have a tendency to organize their lives well. A disorganized, un-conscientious person might lose 20 or 30 minutes rooting through their files to find the right document, an inefficient experience conscientious folks tend to avoid. Basically, by being conscientious, people sidestep stress they'd otherwise create for themselves.  Being conscientious "is like brushing your teeth," Roberts says. "It prevents problems from arising." Conscientious people also like to follow rules and norms. You can spot the conscientious kids in the classroom. They sit in their chairs, don't complain, and don't act out — which also, of course, contributes to earning good grades from teachers. While conscientiousness doesn't correlate with high SAT scores, it does predict high GPAs. However, that impulse toward convention doesn't lend itself to every job type . Work that requires innovation, creativity, and spontaneity doesn't fit well to a highly conscientious personality; a highly conscientious painter would stick to the norms of a genre rather than expanding it, and a highly conscientious chef would be less likely to tinker with tried-and-true recipes. If you're looking for creativity, select for openness to experience. To spot conscientious people at work, Roberts says to look for punctuality. If someone shows up on time, that's a great clue toward conscientiousness, since a punctual person has to be organized enough — and care enough — to arrive on time. The bigger, and less visible, indicator is how people deal with setbacks. Do they give up or redouble their efforts? "The conscientious person is going to have a plan," Roberts says. "Even if there is a failure, they're going to have a plan to deal with that failure."More From Business InsiderYou've Probably Been Taking Notes Wrong Your Entire Life The Secret To Making A Great First Impression Is Ridiculously Simple Take Our 21-Day Program For Radical Self-Improvement
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-secret-tactics-warehouse-stores-160029166.html	7 secret tactics warehouse stores don’t want you to know	Everything is larger than life at Costco, Sam’s Club and BJ’s Wholesale Club: product sizes, shelves, even the shopping cart. Whether you’re a family stocking the pantry on a budget or a soccer coach looking for post-game snacks in bulk, you can trundle some killer deals out the door.Yet we also have to remember that like any other retailer, warehouse stores stay in business because they know how to part us from our dollars.1. Ignore “warehouse” decorThe floors are concrete. The beams are exposed. Stuff is stacked on plain metal shelving or on pallets that connote discount abundance.Here’s what that says to us consumers: “They don’t waste money on décor and carpeting and Muzak, so we’re bound to get unbelievable deals.”Generally that’s true. Just make sure that fear of missing a great price doesn’t keep you from doing the math. Remember, too, that low prices might tempt us to buy stuff we don’t strictly need.2. Remember that you ARE paying extraPart of the reason we pay less is that we pay each year for the privilege of walking through the door. The annual fee offsets some of our savings.Generally speaking, the membership fee will easily pay for itself, especially if you’re purchasing basics like over-the-counter medications, gasoline, tires, meat, dairy products and pet food. (See “10 Best Buys at Warehouse Clubs” for more information.)At times you can get a better deal at regular stores, especially when combining sales and coupons. (Hint:Sites like CouponMom.com and regional coupon blogs will do all the legwork.)However, getting a pretty good price consistently at the warehouse likely beats getting super prices every so often and so-so deals the rest of the time at supermarkets and drugstores. If you’re the kind of person who doesn’t want to fuss with coupons, warehouse stores might be for you.3. How many tomatoes do you really need?Large quantities are the hallmark of warehouse stores. But even if you really like an item, be honest: Are you going to be able to consume that much bagged salad, cookies or whatever? (And if they’re giant quantities of junk food, should you be consuming that much?)Put another way: I love grape tomatoes. They make a wonderful snack and of course they’re delicious in salads. But we probably couldn’t finish several pounds of the things before they rotted, and if you’re throwing food away, you’re not saving money.4. Beware the deadly FOMO“Fear of missing out” drives a lot of irrational buying. Knowing that the inventory changes constantly might cause you to pull the trigger on a purchase even if you’re not sure you need/want it: This Carhartt jacket might not be here next week!Now ask yourself: Do you need a new jacket? Or was the fear of missing out on such a screamin’ deal causing you to buy without thinking things through?Don’t do that. If you don’t need it, it’s no bargain.5. Put on your track shoesAs soon as you enter the store, run. Do not be distracted by the bright shiny big-screen televisions, smartphones and all those other pretty toys by the entrance.If you’ve been wavering about making a purchase like this, the discounted price tag might be enough to convince you. But if that new iWhatever isn’t currently in your budget, you’ve just made another decision: to carry a credit card balance or to withdraw money from savings.Much better to wait until you’ve saved enough to pay cash; you can use that time to research the best buys.6. Think FOMO was bad? Try WWLTJust as bad as fear of missing out is what I call WWLT: “Wouldn’t (whoever) love that?” You see the camouflage-printed jammies or the hardback mystery novel that would be perfect for someone in your life. (Like, say, yourself.)Come clean: Have you ever gone to Costco for milk, oranges and canned goods and walked out with a trampoline? It happens.Perhaps your downfall is the children’s outfits that are so cute and so perfect for your granddaughter. Or maybe it’s those giant tubs of gummy bears, which cost the same as just a few bags at the supermarket, so aren’t you saving money by buying?Uh, no. If it’s something you don’t need, or something you want but can’t pay for right now, then it’s no bargain.7. Be an informed consumerThe same consumer tactics you use everywhere else also apply at warehouse stores: Make a list, compare unit prices, and carry cash vs. plastic.And once more, with feeling: Learn the difference between wants and needs. Sure, that next-generation smartphone or giant-screen TV might improve your life, but it shouldn’t do so at the expense (so to speak) of your everyday budget. Get real about what’s needed each week, and then save up for the wants.This article was originally published on MoneyTalksNews.com as '7 Secret Tactics Warehouse Stores Don’t Want You To Know'.More from Money Talks News:10 Best Buys at Warehouse Clubs 11 Things NOT to Buy on Black Friday 5 Lies Retailers Tell (And How to Avoid Falling for Them)

Former President George W. Bush has a simple explanation for why he almost never criticizes his successor: He feels it undermines the office of the presidency.In an interview that aired Thursday night on Fox News' "Hannity," Bush insisted he would not attack President Barack Obama even though he continued to have strong opinions about national politics."I don't think it's good for the country to have a former president undermine a current president; I think it's bad for the presidency for that matter," Bush said, according to video posted by Mediaite.Bush, who is promoting his book about his father (former President George H.W. Bush), "41: A Portrait of My Father," also said he had no interest in generating headlines for himself after serving in the country's highest office for eight years."Secondly, I really have had all the fame I want," he added. "I really don't long for publicity. And the truth the matter is in order for me to generate publicity ... I'd have to either attack the Republican Party, which I don't want to do, or attack the president, which I don't want to do. And so I'm perfectly content to be out of the limelight."Though Bush has avoided criticizing the Obama administration, the same can't be said for his former vice president, Dick Cheney, who has repeatedly skewered Obama. Among other things, Cheney called Obama the "worst president of my lifetime."More From Business InsiderCHENEY: I'd Be Shocked If Obama Did The Right Thing On ISIS CHENEY: Obama Would 'Rather Be On The Golf Course' Than The Situation Room CHENEY: The Obama Administration 'Can't Blame George Bush Anymore'

About the only function I can think of for this would be to help cool off sweaty singers during the summer months in Thailand karaoke bars, but that’s about it.But while the device seems to have rather limited uses, at least it does promise to cool you down and give you a speaker you can hook up to your computer… except that it fails miserably at these functions.When we turned on the fan we found that it will blow cool air on you if you hold it approximately one foot away from your face — otherwise, you’ll get nothing. The fan was also annoyingly loud and we couldn’t stand the thought of it being on all the time.As for the speakers, we soon discovered that my wife’s old iPhone 4 actually offered better sound quality, as songs that we tried playing over it sounded tinny and were marred by constant static.And here’s the real kicker: Even though the device boasts of having a built-in microphone, the actual mic is located at the very bottom of the device between the two speakers. And given how poor the device’s overall hardware is, you have to speak directly into the mic to get any reasonable sound. As you can see in the closeup below, speaking directly into the microphone makes you feel as though you’re whispering sweet nothings in between someone’s butt cheeks.Of course, you also have the option of hooking up a microphone to the back of the device, but the device doesn’t come with a microphone intact, so unless you’re willing to pay extra, you’re stuck with the butt-crack mic.So there you have it. This is without a doubt the crappiest gadget I have ever used, although I imagine that many other people out there have received even worse ones.In fact, this gives me an idea: If you received an atrociously awful gadget for Christmas this year, send me a picture of it and a brief description to my email brad@bgr.com. In a few days I will post the most hilariously bad Christmas gifts you got this year just for fun.So get cracking, loyal readers. Send me pics of those terrible gadget gifts!More from BGR: Google lists 127 of the best Android apps in the world, and you need to try them all
http://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Duchess-Cambridge-Remembrance-Sunday-2014-36079290	Kate, Will, and Harry Pay Their Respects to Fallen Soldiers	The royal family was in an appropriately solemn mood on Remembrance Sunday when they honored fallen soldiers in London. The Duchess of Cambridge stood next to Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, as they watched Prince Charles, Prince William, and Queen Elizabeth II lay wreaths at the Cenotaph on Whitehall in London. Pregnant Kate was careful with her actions on this Remembrance Sunday after she was the subject of bizarre criticism last year when she was seen twirling her curled hair at one point during the event. This year's event was important on two accounts — it marks the 100th anniversary of the start of World War I and the 70th anniversary of the D-day invasion in Normandy, France. All eyes were also on the queen, as she had reportedly recently avoided an assassination attempt after British police allegedly arrested a group of men who were planning on attacking her during the weekend-long Remembrance Sunday events. While an assassination attempt might rattle many public figures, the queen didn't show any signs of fear and has continued on with all of her events.Meanwhile, Prince Harry made a surprise visit to Kandahar, Afghanistan, where he too partook in a poppy-wreath-laying service with British troops still stationed in that country. Their ceremony was noticeably more relaxed than the one in London, with Harry chatting with his fellow servicemen after taking part in the ceremony.

http://www.aol.com/article/2014/11/09/nicki-minaj-hosts-as-mtv-emas-come-to-glasgow/20990894/	Nicki Minaj, Ariana Grande winners at MTV EMAs	GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) - Nicki Minaj rapped about shortbread and Ariana Grande capped a breakthrough year with two trophies as the MTV Europe Music Awards celebrated its 20th anniversary Sunday with a Scottish-accented show in Glasgow.Grande was named best female artist and also took the best-single prize for "Problem," one of a string of hits she's had this year. The 21-year-old American singer said she was doubly grateful to the EMAs - meeting Iggy Azalea at last year's awards show led directly to working with the Australian rapper on "Problem.""This is absolutely crazy," Grande said after her second win of the night.It was a good result for a performer who admitted she was too excited to sleep the night before the ceremony, and said was shaking after walking past a gaggle of photographers on the red carpet.Minaj proved a confident if conventional host for the show at Glasgow's SSE Hydro arena, and she also took home the prize for best hip-hop artist."I've been learning so much about your beautiful country and culture ... I've pretty much become Scottish," Minaj said. She illustrated it by rapping about whiskey and shortbread and singing a snippet of The Proclaimers' anthem "500 Miles."Minaj's more provocative side was kept under tight control. There were writhing dancers during a performance of her bum-centric hit "Anaconda," a putt into derriere-shaped mini-golf hole in tribute to Scotland's love of golf, and a couple of F-bomb obscenities directed at - of all things - an animatronic dinosaur. But on the whole the event stuck to a standard awards-show script.Beyonce did not appear as widely rumored, and Scottish DJ Calvin Harris had to pull out due to illness. But thousands of young Scottish music fans in the arena - and a global TV audience - saw a high-energy show featuring performances from acts including Ed Sheeran, Alicia Keys, Enrique Iglesias and U2, who brought their own string section.Rising talent was represented by the likes of crunchy British rock duo Royal Blood and singer Charli XCX, while former "Baywatch" star David Hasselhoff got a rousing cheer when he took the stage in a kilt.Winners of the awards are selected by fans across the continent. The EMAs are held in a different European city each year.Ubiquitous boy band One Direction won three awards, including best pop act. Katy Perry and Australian punk-poppers 5 Seconds of Summer each won two, and wayward heartthrob Justin Bieber was named best male artist.None of those acts was on hand to accept their prizes in person.Linkin Park won the rock category, and Chinese singer Bibi Zhou was proclaimed best worldwide act.The awards, founded in 1994, adopted a time-travel theme for their 20th anniversary. Giant balloons of the planets floated in the arena, and Grande performed her song "Break Free" from a flying pod while wearing a white mini-dress reminiscent of the animated TV show "The Jetsons."But there were few of the unscripted-feeling moments that made past shows stick in the memory - Kanye West crashing the stage after losing in 2006, Miley Cyrus smoking a joint in Amsterdam last year.Even former bat-chomping hell-raiser Ozzy Osbourne - introduced by guitar hero Slash as a man who "scares the hell out of most people, and all bats" - seemed an elder statesman as he accepted a Global Icon accolade.Get a behind-the-scenes look at who wore what on the red carpet at the 2014 MTV EMAs:
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eat-the-press/2006/10/06/excerpt-new-yorkem_e_31146.html	Eat The Press | Excerpt: New York</em Mag On Stephen Colbert...And Ann Coulter	from NYMagNew York |  Adam Sternbergh |  Posted Friday October 6, 2006 at 06:06 PMETP Exclusive!* New York magazine has an automatic winner in putting this Stephen Colbert article — or really any Stephen Colbert article — on the cover (if you don't believe me, I have a bridge in Hungary you might be interested in). This particular Colbert article looks to be extra-good, authored as it is by the perspicacious and very funny in his own right Adam Sternbergh. No doubt there will be some interesting ad thoughtful nuggets in there; indeed, we've got some below as Sternbergh deconstructs Colbert's swaggering, outrageous blowhard demeanor and commentary and finds it surprisingly similar to that of...Ann Coulter. In fact, he offers The Stephen Colbert-Ann Coulter Challenge: See if you can tell the difference between comments made by Colbert and Coulter. (NB: Not to be confused with the Stephen Colbert Greenscreen Challenge, or the Stephen Colbert Vulcan Ears Challenge**). Here are a few:"Even Islamic terrorists don't hate America like liberals do. They don't have the energy. If they had that much energy, they'd have indoor plumbing by now." "There's nothing wrong with being gay. I have plenty of friends who are going to hell." "I just think Rosa Parks was overrated. Last time I checked, she got famous for breaking the law." "Being nice to people is, in fact, one of the incidental tenets of Christianity, as opposed to other religions whose tenets are more along the lines of 'Kill everyone who doesn't smell bad and answer to the name Muhammad.'" "I believe that everyone has the right to their own religion, be you Hindu, Muslim, or Jewish. I believe there are infinite paths to accepting Jesus Christ as your personal savior." "[North Korea] is a major threat. I just think it would be fun to nuke them and have it be a warning to the rest of the world." "Isn't an agnostic just an atheist without balls?"Answers, and awesome juicy excerpt, after the jump.*It's fun saying that, right Meet The Press? **Send your doctored pics in today!(Answers: Coulter 1, 4,6; Colbert 2, 3, 5, 7)Excerpt: "Stephen Colbert Reports from Inside the Republican Brain" by Adam SternberghHere's something Colbertophiles might not know or might not want to know: He loves Richard Nixon. He has a 1972 Nixon campaign poster on the wall of his office. He points at it and says, "He was so liberal! Look at what he was running on. He started the EPA. He opened China. He gave 18-year-olds the vote. His issues were education, drugs, women, minorities, youth involvement, ending the draft, and improving the environment. John Kerry couldn't have run on this! What would I give for a Nixon?" Colbert in person is one of those rare comedians who likes to dissect comedy, especially his own comedy, and especially what makes his own comedy funny. This is owed in part to the nature of his show--he plays an abrasive character who is, on the surface, designed to be repellent but is actually meant to entertain--which means he's spent a lot of time thinking about how exactly to pull off this trick. When he was developing the idea with Karlin and Stewart, he said to them, "I can't be an asshole." And Stewart said, "You're not an asshole. You're an idiot. There's a difference." For starters, being an idiot gives him a certain license. "The audience wouldn't forgive Jon for saying things most comedians would want to say. But we can say almost anything, because it's coming out of the mouth of this character." Still, there's obvious room for overlap and conflict between the two shows; for example, a "War on Valentine's Day" story that Colbert's writers had prepared a long segment about, only to learn The Daily Show had already done a field piece on the topic. Both shows maintain independent writing staffs, so Ben Karlin zips back and forth between the studios, overseeing the tapings and making the final call if there's a tug-of-war. "The game they're playing is a slightly different one from us," says Stewart, "so we don't trip on each other that much. And let's put it this way: This ain't the Serengeti. There's plenty of food to go around." If a story's big enough, like the Mark Foley sex scandal, both shows will take a bite--Stewart with his What is this world coming to? lament and Colbert with his contrarian-at-all-costs irony. "It's the Jewish Day of Atonement," said Stewart on-air, about Foley. "I don't know how many days of fasting can get you out of trying to bang 16-year-olds. My guess is at least three days. Even after that, probably a month of salads." On his show, Colbert defended Foley as misunderstood, claiming "stud" is a text-­message acronym for "Strong Teenager Using Democracy," and "horny" stands for "Happy On Reaching New Year's." "Every January 1," announced Colbert in that unwavering pundit's tone, "that is the message I send to my buddies at ­Stephen Colbert's Youth Camp for Young Studs: 'I am incredibly horny.' " Colbert's on-air personality, so distinct from Stewart's, leads to a peculiar comedic alchemy on the show. During one taping I attended, Colbert did a bit about eating disorders that ended with his addressing the camera and saying flatly, "Girls, if we can't see your ribs, you're ugly." The audience laughed. I laughed. The line was obviously, purposefully outrageous. But it was weird to think that this no-doubt self-identified progressive-liberal crowd was howling at a line that, if it had been delivered verbatim by Ann Coulter on Today, would have them sputtering with rage. In fact, here's a list of statements by either Stephen Colbert or Ann Coulter. See if you can tell who said what:"Even Islamic terrorists don't hate America like liberals do. They don't have the energy. If they had that much energy, they'd have indoor plumbing by now." "There's nothing wrong with being gay. I have plenty of friends who are going to hell." "I just think Rosa Parks was overrated. Last time I checked, she got famous for breaking the law." "Being nice to people is, in fact, one of the incidental tenets of Christianity, as opposed to other religions whose tenets are more along the lines of 'Kill everyone who doesn't smell bad and answer to the name Muhammad.'" "I believe that everyone has the right to their own religion, be you Hindu, Muslim, or Jewish. I believe there are infinite paths to accepting Jesus Christ as your personal savior." "[North Korea] is a major threat. I just think it would be fun to nuke them and have it be a warning to the rest of the world." "Isn't an agnostic just an atheist without balls?" (Answers: Coulter 1, 4,6 Colbert 2, 3, 5, 7) Of course, I'm not trying to equate Coulter with Colbert. For starters, Coulter is a shrill, abusive demagogue and Colbert just plays one on TV. But with Coulter, there's always been a sturdy suspicion that she is playing a character (like Colbert) and amping up the obnoxious rhetoric for maximum effect (like Colbert). When I mention the comparison to Colbert, though, he seems surprised, even unnerved. "I don't really think about her much," he says. "She's a self-generating bogeyman. She's like someone who wants attention for having been bad." Given that he's hosted right-wing true believers like Joe Scarborough before, and has often said he'd love to have Bill O'Reilly on the show, would he ever invite Coulter as a guest? "My sense is that she's playing a character," he says. "I don't need another character. There's one character on my show, and that's me."
http://www.realitytea.com/2014/11/10/jacqueline-laurita-bankruptcy-update-case-settled-trustee-seeks-additional-information/	Jacqueline Laurita Bankruptcy Fraud Case Not Settled #RHONJ	Last month a report came out that Jacqueline Laurita‘s bankruptcy fraud case had been settled for a $1 million dollars. But it turns out – settled?! – not so much! An update reveals that the trustee is seeking more time to investigate. I personally have been digging into this story, since we’ve been hearing so many conflicting reports, and the Signature Apparel Bankruptcy fraud case involving Jacqueline, Chris Laurita, and his brother, Joseph is raging on –  no matter how much Jacqueline wants to pretend it’s over and done with!The Lauritas, the former owners of Signature Apparel, LLC, are accused of misappropriating company funds, to the tune of $8 million, for personal use – including vacations, cars, private jets, homes, and shopping – but then filed bankruptcy in 2009 to avoid paying back debts. At that time Signature Apparel was also boasting millions in revenue. Creditors protested the bankruptcy to the trustee, who after investigation, then filed a claim against the Lauritas, resulting in years of court back and forth for the Real Housewives Of New Jersey stars. CLICK THE CONTINUE READING BUTTON FOR MORE!Last week Jacqueline and Chris were scheduled to be return to court, but that has been delayed at the suggestion of the trustee. Despite stories that the trustee and creditors accepted a settlement of $1 million to wipe away debts, that has not been approved by a judge and that motion has been protested by the trustee – which is why the parties were due to be in court this week.The Lauritas‘ attorneys put forth the settlement suggestion of $1 million, allowing for the trustee to determine which creditors are allocated what amount. The trustee, Anthony Labrosciano, currently disagrees with that offer and is seeking more time to determine how to distribute money and to pursue additional claims and monies.“These lawsuits have been and continue to be extraordinarily contentious and complex,” Mr. Labrosciano‘s motion explains. He is suggesting court reconvene on January 30, 2015 reports NJ.com so he has time to further investigate.The court documents are a labyrinth of the Lauritas trying to explain how they had money to finance a lavish lifestyle and other companies, without using the assets of Signature Apparel, which they also allege was losing money, despite evidence to the contrary. The financial documentations are staggeringly obtuse. The trustee and creditors wonder how the sums the Lauritas were loaned by their creditors were unable to improve a then profitable company, meanwhile the Lauritas were spending on things like financing an off-Broadway play, and are not able to verify that they were investing into SA. The trustee is curious about how their company was, supposedly, sinking, but the Lauritas’ lifestyles became increasingly “opulent.” Additionally, the Lauritas had stalled on turning over financial disclosures, resulting in creditors accusing them of intentionally thwarting the court and their debts. The Lauritas claimed they were hiring new attorneys and blamed that for the delay. The Lauritas are also dealing with some tax issues, as a result of their bankruptcy fraud, and their home was recently in foreclosure, but a loan modification saved it. They are currently trying to sell, but so far – no bites! Isn’t it funny how Jacqueline doesn’t spend hours and hours tweeting about this? Or bringing to everyone’s attention how she lied in her bankruptcy filing?! Lesson here folks, which we’ve learned time and time again: live within your means, lest you become Teresa Giudice! The Feds will catch you – and the Feds want that money! I wonder if this will become a storyline on RHONJ next season, now that Teresa’s legal issues won’t take precedence. TELL US – SHOULD JACQUELINE AND CHRIS HAVE TO PAY MORE THAN $1 MILLION?[Photo Credit: Bravo]

http://sports.yahoo.com/news/boxing-star-pacquiao-says-mayweather-nowhere-run-054632652--box.html	Boxing star Pacquiao says Mayweather has 'nowhere to run'	General Santos (Philippines) (AFP) - Philippine boxing legend Manny Pacquiao vowed to chase Floyd Mayweather into ring submission after his US rival offered to fight him next year in a blockbuster world title face-off."He (Mayweather) has reached a dead end. He has nowhere to run but to fight me," Pacquiao told AFP late Saturday, hours after the undefeated Mayweather issued the May 2 challenge on US television.The two were long-time rivals as the "best pound-for-pound" boxers of their generation, but the dream fight has never materialised to the disappointment of the boxing world."I will try my best to (make) this a thrilling and entertaining fight. But I doubt if he's gonna engage me in a slugfest," said the Filipino, winner of an unprecedented eight world titles in different weight classes."You all know his fighting style. Most of his previous fights, if not all, induced us to sleep," said Pacquiao from his southern Philippines home city of General Santos.Should the fight happen, Pacquiao, who turns 36 on Wednesday, said he will do to Mayweather what he did to another previously undefeated American, Chris Algieri, who lost to the World Boxing Organization welterweight champion in Macau last month.View gallery WBC/WBA welterweight champion Floyd Mayweather during his official weigh-in in Las Vegas on Septembe …"I know what I have to do. I will chase him wherever he goes just in case he decides to run around the ring. We will devise a good fight plan against him," Pacquiao added.Speaking to Showtime Sports in the US on Friday night, Mayweather, 37, said he wants his next fight to be against the Filipino star.However, the American nicknamed "Money" said -- without giving details -- that the expected richest fight in boxing history will only happen if he receives a much bigger share of the purse than his opponent.In 2012 there was speculation that a fight between the two could lead to the first $200 million purse in boxing history with much of that money coming from pay-per-view sales.At one point Pacquiao says Mayweather offered him a $40 million purse on the condition Mayweather would keep the pay-per-view money, which would have amounted to more than double what Pacquiao received.Previous talks were also scuttled because Mayweather says Pacquiao refused to submit to random blood testing."Mayweather can get the amount he wants. As early as January this year, I challenged him to a charity fight. Until now, he has not agreed to it. So, money is not the issue in our fight," Pacquiao said Saturday."This fight is about legacy, this is about making the fans happy and, above all, this is for the good of boxing."
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/09/18/polls-open-in-historic-scottish-independence-vote/20964168/	Scots decide whether to declare independence	EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) -- Excitement vied with apprehension as Scottish voters went to the polls Thursday in a referendum on becoming an independent state, deciding whether to dissolve a union with England that brought great prosperity but has increasingly been felt by many Scots as stifling.On the fog-shrouded streets of Scotland's capital, Edinburgh, there was a quiet thrill of history in the making as many Scots prepared to stay up all night in homes and bars to watch the results roll in.Earlier, voters had lined up outside some polling stations even before they opened at 7 a.m. For some, it was a day they had dreamed of for decades. For others, the time had finally come to make up their minds about the future - both for themselves and for the United Kingdom."Fifty years I fought for this," said 83-year-old Isabelle Smith, a Yes supporter in Edinburgh's maritime district of Newhaven, a former fishing port. "And we are going to win. I can feel it in my bones."For Smith, who went to the polling station decked out in a blue-and-white pro-independence shirt and rosette, statehood for Scotland was a dream nurtured during three decades living in the U.S. with her late husband."The one thing America has that the Scots don't have is confidence," said Smith, who returned to Scotland years ago. "But they're getting it, they're walking tall.""No matter what, Scotland will never, ever be the same again."The question on the ballot paper could not be simpler: "Should Scotland be an independent country?"Yet it has divided Scots during months of campaigning, generating an unprecedented volume and intensity of public debate and participation. The Yes side, in particular, has energized young people and previously disillusioned working-class voters.Polls suggest the result was too close to call. A final Ipsos MORI poll released Thursday put support for the No side at 53 percent and Yes at 47 percent. The phone survey of 991 people has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.The future of the 307-year-old union with England was to be decided in 15 hours of voting. Polling stations were busy and turnout was expected to be high, with more than 4.2 million people registered to vote - 97 percent of those eligible. Residents as young as 16 can vote.Until recently, polls suggested as many as 1 in 5 voters was undecided, but that number has shrunk dramatically. In the latest poll, only 4 percent remained uncertain how they would vote.A Yes vote would trigger 18 months of negotiations between Scottish leaders and London-based politicians on how the two countries would separate their institutions before Scotland's planned Independence Day of March 24, 2016.Many questions - the currency independent Scotland would use, its status within the European Union and NATO, the fate of Britain's nuclear-armed submarines, based at a Scottish port - remain uncertain or disputed after months of campaigning.After weeks in which British media have talked of little else, the television airwaves were almost a referendum-free zone Thursday. Electoral rules forbid discussion and analysis of elections on television while the polls are open.On the streets, it was a different story, with rival Yes and No billboards and campaigners outside many polling places.At an Edinburgh polling station, Thomas Roberts said he had voted Yes because he felt optimistic about Scotland's future as an independent country."Why not roll the dice for once?" he asked.Once the polls closed, ballot boxes were to be transported to 32 regional centers for counting. The result was expected Friday morning.Roberts said he was looking forward to learning the outcome in a pub, many of which were staying open overnight."I'm going to sit with a beer in my hand watching the results coming in," Roberts said.Many who oppose independence agreed that the campaign had reinvigorated Scottish democracy."I support the No side, but it's been a fascinating, worthwhile discussion about Scotland's future," said David Clarke, a writing consultant."If it's a No, it's a win-win situation. If it's a Yes, we will have to deal with the fact that it's a Yes."But other No supporters said the noisy pro-independence campaign had divided the country and fueled bad feeling among neighbors."The country is divided with a hatchet. It's so awful - and it was completely unnecessary," said Fiona Mitchell, distributing No leaflets outside a polling station.First Minister Alex Salmond, leader of the independence campaign, cast his vote near his home in northeastern Scotland. If the Yes side prevails, he will have realized a long-held dream of leading his country to independence from an alliance with England formed in 1707.In a final speech on Wednesday night, Salmond told voters: "This is our opportunity of a lifetime and we must seize it with both hands."Pro-independence forces got a last-minute boost from tennis star Andy Murray, who signaled his support of the Yes campaign in a tweet to his 2.7 million followers early Thursday.Anti-independence leaders, including former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, have implored Scots not to break their links with the rest of the United Kingdom, and have stressed the economic uncertainties independence would bring.Many Yes supporters planned to stay up late in bars, or to gather in symbolic spots like Calton Hill, overlooking Edinburgh - hoping the sun will rise Friday on a new dawn and not a hangover.But financial consultant Michael MacPhee, a No voter, said he would observe the returns coming in "with anxiety."Scottish independence was "the daftest idea I've ever heard," he said.---

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/12/06/bad-news-for-smokers-tobacco-hits-a-dubious-milest.aspx	Bad News for Smokers: Tobacco Hits a Dubious Milestone	Source: Flickr user Morgan.Times are changing in the tobacco industry whether cigarette producers and consumers are ready for it or not.Earlier this decade a pledge was enacted by the federal government to cut the number of adult smokers by 2020 to 12% or less of the population. The Healthy People 2020 initiative, as it's known, is founded on educating the public about the dangers of smoking, providing assistance with quitting, and running aggressive advertisement campaigns across multiple media channels highlighting the damaging effects of smoking. It's also concurrently backed up by tobacco producers' need to raise cigarette prices as demand for tobacco products falls. Higher pricing acts as a potential detriment to current smokers.Altogether, these tactics helped cigarette smoking hit another important milestone in 2013 based on the latest data from the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, or MMWR.Tobacco's big milestone According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which used data from the National Health Interview Survey in 2013, there are now just 42.1 million smokers aged 18 and up (17.8% of the population) compared to 45.1 million adult smokers (20.9% of the population) in 2005. That 3 million smoker reduction is a strong step in the right direction, and an all-time record low among adult smokers. For added context, smoking rates among adults 50 years ago were about 42%!Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Additionally, even those people who are still smoking are smoking less per day. The survey showed the average number of cigarettes smoked per day fell from 16.7 in 2005 to 14.2 in 2013. This was especially noticeable among heavy smokers where those who smoke 30 or more cigarettes per day made up just 7.1% of all smoking adults compared to 12.7% in 2015. Respondents that smoked 20-29 cigarettes per day also saw a noticeable decline from 34.9% of all smokers in 2005 to just 29.3% in 2013.The fight against tobacco is certainly not something everyone is going to agree with (there are still 42 million-plus smokers out there), but its negative effects on the body are without argument. Smoking has been linked to heart disease and lung cancer, two of the more prevalent killers in the U.S., and it takes an incredible toll on the healthcare system, costing $289 billion annually in combined direct healthcare expenses and indirect productivity losses. Not to mention, tobacco use kills 480,000 people prematurely each year. It's no wonder the CDC refers to tobacco as the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States.Alternatives exist, but may not be ideal Alternatives to cigarettes do exist, but not all of them may prove ideal. In addition to nicotine patches and gum, it's possible that electronic cigarettes may also play a role in reducing tobacco consumption, though that assumption is up for some argument.Source: Flickr user Joseph Morris.The premise behind the electronic cigarette is simple. A liquid containing nicotine is vaporized within a cartridge that may or may not resemble a cigarette and inhaled as if the user were smoking a cigarette. The device allows a user to get their nicotine without the many other carcinogenic products typically associated with traditional cigarette smoke. Blu, which is the market-leading electronic cigarette brand with about half of all electronic cigarette sales, is owned by Lorillard (NYSE: LO  ) in the meantime, but the pending purchase of Lorillard by Reynolds American (NYSE: RAI  ) will see the Blu brand eventually divested.However, the CDC has shed plenty of question marks on the electronic cigarette sector, too. A CDC study from September showed that while electronic cigarette usage grew from 3% of the population to 8% between 2010 and 2012, it remained flat at 8% in 2013. Furthermore, just 2% of the population used an electronic cigarette within the past 30 days. In other words, electronic cigarettes rapid growth may have already come and gone.Concerns also exist about the true intentions of electronic cigarette producers. With flavored liquid vapor that would appear to appeal to a younger audience, and no direct evidence that it's helping people put their tobacco products down, it's likely that traditional quitting methods proposed for decades by the CDC will remain the primary method of getting current smokers to not light up.An interesting winner Because cigarettes are so addictive the strong pricing power of tobacco producers all but assures their cash flow will still remain strong, even if there are minimal declines on an annual basis in terms of volume. But, tobacco producers aren't who I believe this latest report benefits most. Instead, I consider the MMWR a continuing victory for the nation's insurers.Source: Official U.S. Navy Page via Flickr.On the surface the logic behind my assumption might seem flawed. Under the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare as you might know it best, people are required by the individual mandate to purchase health insurance or face a penalty. Part of the new requirements built into Obamacare also state that insurers can't deny coverage to people based on preexisting conditions. Among the very few options insurers still have of charging one consumer more than the next is whether or not they use tobacco products. Tobacco users can wind up paying 50% higher premium costs than non-tobacco users.The implication here might be "Great! Insurers are getting more money upfront because of smokers!" The problem is that smoking can cause serious lifelong complications that can get extremely pricey for insurers and are unlikely to be made up by a 50% increase in monthly premiums. A steady reduction in smoking rates means national insurers like UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH  ) are likely to see a reduction in smoking-related chronic illnesses from their members, which helps save them money in the long run.One final note, let's not also overlook that the American public is a winner here too. A reduction in first-hand and second-hand smoking may lead to reduced incidence rates of lung cancer, heart disease, and a handful of other ailments over time. This means people could lead longer, healthier lives.With cigarette and health care costs on the rise, perhaps it's time you took advantage of this little-known tax "loophole" Recent tax increases have affected nearly every American taxpayer.

http://www.voanews.com/content/us-starts-ebola-screenings-at-jfk-airport/2480552.html	US Airports Step Up Ebola Screening	Western nations are boosting measures to guard against Ebola.In the United States, a New York City airport Saturday became the first in the country to begin a stepped-up screening program to prevent the disease's spread.The John F. Kennedy International Airport began taking the temperatures of passengers arriving from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea as part of the new measures. Travelers will also face questions to determine whether they may have come into contact with an infected person.The new procedures will expand to four additional airports this coming week: the Newark airport in New Jersey, Washington Dulles Airport, Chicago's O'Hare and the international airport in Atlanta. Together, the five airports receive more than 90 percent of all travelers entering the United States from the three worst-affected West African countries.Britain is also introducing Ebola screening at certain airports and train stations.Britain's chief medical officer, Sally Davies, said Saturday the country should expect a "handful" of Ebola cases in the next few months. Authorities held an eight-hour drill across the nation Saturday to test British readiness to deal with such an outbreak.Meanwhile, in the Spanish capital of Madrid, three more people have been hospitalized with possible Ebola symptoms, boosting the total number of patients being monitored for the virus to 16.The hospitalizations come after a Spanish nurse was diagnosed with Ebola after caring for two Spanish priests who died of the disease in Spain after contracting it in Africa. Officials said the nurse was in serious but stable condition Saturday.Back in the U.S., New Jersey health officials issued an order of mandatory quarantine for members of an NBC news crew who worked with a U.S. cameraman infected with Ebola in Liberia. The order went into effect late Friday. New Jersey health department officials say the crew members remain symptom-free, so there is no reason for concern of exposure to the community.The infected camera, Ashoka Mukpo, is being treated in Nebraska.His is one of more than 8,000 Ebola cases the World Health Organization says have been recorded in seven countries.The U.N. agency announced a higher worldwide death toll Friday of more than 4,000 people.Outside of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, eight people died in Nigeria and one patient died in the United States.The victim in the U.S., Liberian native Thomas Eric Duncan, was the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in the United States. His death has raised fears of the disease spreading outside of Africa.Death toll risingOn Friday, the World Health Organization said the death toll from the Ebola outbreak has risen to more than 4,000 people.  The U.N. agency said nearly 8,400 cases of the disease have been recorded in seven countries, with 4,033 people dying from the epidemic.It said all but nine of the deaths were in the three Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.  Eight people died in Nigeria and one patient died in the United States.The data also includes one Ebola case each in Spain and Senegal, but no deaths in those countries.A separate Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo has killed 43 people.International aid falls shortAlso Friday, the United Nations said it had received only a quarter of its appeal of $1 billion to respond to the outbreak.The virus that causes Ebola spreads only through direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person who is showing symptoms.VIDEO: A Day with Sierra Leone’s First Body Burial TeamSome information for this report comes from AP, AFP and Reuters.
http://news.yahoo.com/running-death-grandmother-wants-charge-dismissed-095916295.html	Running death: Grandmother wants charge dismissed	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) — An Alabama woman accused of running her granddaughter to death has asked an appeals court to dismiss a capital murder charge against her, citing potential autopsy problems and legal delays.Lawyers for Joyce Garrard Hardin, 49, have filed papers with the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals saying they found numerous problems with the state's autopsy of 9-year-old Savannah Hardin in 2012.Hardin has been jailed since Feb, 22, 2012, accused of making her granddaughter run for hours as punishment for a lie about candy. Authorities have said the girl was exhausted to the point of collapsing. She died three days later in a hospital.The defense contends the child died because of long-standing health problems, adding testimony about the girl's physical condition and the autopsy could be vital at trial. Those lawyers have asked the appeals court to order a circuit judge in Alabama's Etowah County, William Ogletree, to throw out the charge.Hardin has pleaded not guilty but faces a possible death penalty if convicted. Her trial is set to begin Feb. 12 in Gadsden; two previous trial dates were pushed back.Prosecutors have yet to respond to the defense document, which was filed Oct. 28 in Montgomery. The document was released by the appeals court Thursday at the request of The Associated Press. The state has until later this month to file an answer with the appellate panel and is under a gag order barring out-of-court comments.A petition filed by the defense contends the girl's autopsy was performed by a doctor who was later fired over allegations that included possible falsification of documents and dereliction of duty. The physician has since failed to testify in other cases and may not be available to testify in Hardin's trial, the defense argued in the document.Hardin's trial has been delayed twice despite defense attempts to move the case along, the attorneys argued. They said in their document that the postponements violate the woman's constitutional right to a speedy trial.Also, the defense claimed, Hardin is suffering from numerous health problems in the Etowah County jail and should be freed.Ogletree has previously refused to dismiss charges against Hardin.The child's stepmother is free on bond after being charged with murder for allegedly failing to intervene while the girl was running outside Hardin's rural home.
http://news.yahoo.com/heroin-statistics-spooked-white-house-185303732.html	The Heroin Statistics That Spooked the White House	Between 2002 and 2013, the rate of people dying from heroin-related overdoses in the U.S. almost quadrupled.This dramatic increase, as well as a spike in heroin use, is why the White House introduced Monday a $5 million program aimed at curbing heroin use and trafficking. Half of the money will go to a program that emphasizes treatment over prosecution of drug addicts. The Washington Post first reported the plan and the reasoning behind it, citing two senior administration officials. Here’s how it will work:The experiment, initially funded for one year in 15 states from New England to the D.C. area, will pair drug intelligence officers with public health coordinators to trace where heroin is coming from, how and where it is being laced with a deadly additive, and who is distributing it to street-level dealers.The initiative addresses “the heroin and prescription opioid epidemic as both a public health and a public safety issue," Michael Botticelli, the director of National Drug Control Policy, said in a statement Monday. His agency will carry out the plan.Recommended: Top Admiral Says There's 'No Reason' Why Women Can't Join Navy SEALsIn the U.S., more people—men and women, in all income levels, in most age groups—are using heroin, according to a recent report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Officials attribute the trend to lower prices of heroin, increasing abuse of prescription opiate pain medication (which often leads to heroin use), and other factors. The greatest increases, the CDC says, have been in demographic groups with historically low rates of heroin use, like women, people who have private health insurance, and high-income individuals. More than 8,200 people died of heroin overdose in 2013 alone. Between 2007 and 2014, heroin arrests by the Drug Enforcement Administration nearly doubled, and surpassed marijuana arrests for the first time.Pairing cops with docs on drug-use efforts has shown some success. A May study by funded by the National Institute of Drug Abuse and published in The Lancet, a leading medical journal, found that people who were incarcerated for six months or fewer and who underwent methadone maintenance, a common treatment method for drug addiction, while imprisoned were more likely to get additional treatment after their release.How Trigger Warnings Are Hurting Mental Health on Campus No, Stephen Harper Isn't Killing Canadian Democracy How to Get Low-Wage Workers Into the Middle ClassThis article was originally published on The Atlantic.
https://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/advisor/magnetic-field-earth-moon-used-much-stronger-researchers-050035600.html	The Magnetic Field Of Earth’s Moon Used To Be Much Stronger, Researchers Are Baffled	The Magnetic Field Of Earths Moon Used To Be Much Stronger, Researchers Are BaffledThe Earth’s moon used to have a stronger magnetic field. During samples collected from the Apollo missions, researchers claimed that the moon featured a magnetic field as strong as strong as 70 microteslas. That’s compared to 50 microteslas here on Earth. At present, the moon does not have a global magnetic field.Benjamin Weiss, the co-author of the new study, says, “Earth’s magnetic field is currently 50 microteslas in strength. The early moon may have had a magnetic field that was bigger, maybe up to more than 70 microteslas.”Weiss and Sonia Tikoo, who had their study published in Journal Sciences, suggest that the magnetic field of the moon can be the result of the molten liquid core that our satellite had taken for research. They postulate that planets  and other bodies move electrically conducting fluids around themselves, thus generating magnetic fields through a process which they compared to a dynamo. They note that earlier scientists did not understand whether the moon generated the magnetic filed itself or if it was due to the outside forces.The group of researchers spent the last six years using new and advanced search methods in order to find strong signals that the moon might have had a magnetic core of its own. They believe that if the moon had a similar internal dynamo, it would allow them to better understand its inner structure and solve a problem scientists have grappled with for years.After several conducting studies, they could not say why the moon actually stopped producing the magnetic field. Researchers are also still confused at how such a small core on the moon could have created the original strong magnetic field it is originally believed to have produced.[Photo Credit: Gregory H.

http://www.space.com/30263-paul-sutter-on-why-magnetars-are-scary.html	Why Magnetars Should Freak You Out	Artist's impression of the magnetar in star cluster Westerlund 1. Credit: ESO/L. CalçadaPaul Sutter is a research fellow at the Astronomical Observatory of Trieste and a visiting scholar at The Ohio State University's Center for Cosmology and Astro-Particle Physics. Sutter is also host of the podcasts "Ask a Spaceman" and "RealSpace," and the YouTube series "Space In Your Face." He contributed this article to Space.com's Expert Voices: Op-Ed & Insights.I'll be honest: Magnetars freak me out. But to get to the "why," I have to explain the "what." Magnetars are a special kind of neutron star, and neutron stars are a special kind of dead star. They're easy enough to make — if you're a massive star. All stars fuse hydrogen into helium deep in their cores. The energy released supports the stars against the crushing weight of their own gravity and, as a handy byproduct, provides the warmth and light necessary for life on any orbiting planets. But eventually, that fuel in the core runs out, allowing gravity to temporarily win and crush the star's core even tighter.With the greater pressure, it becomes helium's turn to fuse, combining into oxygen and carbon, until the helium, too, gives out. That's where our own sun gets off the fusion train, but more massive stars can keep on chugging along, climbing up the periodic table in ever more intense and short-lived reaction phases, all the way up to nickel and iron.Once that solid lump of nickel and iron forms in the stellar core, a lot of things go haywire — fast. There's still a lot of star stuff left in the atmosphere, pressing into that core, but further fusion doesn't release energy, so there's nothing left to prevent collapse. And collapse it does: The nickel and iron nuclei (yes, just nuclei; don't even think about entire atoms at these temperatures and pressures) break apart. They just can't handle this nuclear mosh pit. Stray electrons get shoved into the nearest protons, converting them to neutrons. The neutrons … stay neutrons. And those neutrons are mighty good at preventing further collapse, for reasons I’ll explain in a bit. The infalling gas, trying to crush the core into oblivion, bounces off that neutron core and goes kablamo! (Note: I don't know what it actually sounds like.)A supernova is born.The neutron ballWhat happens during the supernova event is an exciting discussion for another day. What we're concerned with now is the leftovers: a soupy, ball-like mixture of neutrons and a few straggler protons. This ball is supported against its own weight by "degeneracy pressure," which is a fancy way of saying that you can only pack so many neutrons in box — or, in this case, a ball. It may seem obvious that neutrons, well, take up space, but things didn't have to turn out this way. It's this degeneracy pressure that causes the big bounce that puts the super in supernova.I should note that, if there's still too much stuff left hanging out around this leftover neutron ball, the weight can overwhelm even degeneracy pressure. And now, look what you've done: You've gone and made a black hole. But that, too, is another story. We wouldn't want to be like our poor star and get overwhelmed.The neutron ball — which I should now call by its proper name, a neutron star  — is weird. Seriously, that's the best word I can find to describe it. Neutron stars are basically city-size atomic nuclei, which makes them among the densest things in the universe. The pressure of gravity inside these stars has squeezed apart even atomic nuclei, allowing their bits to float freely. It's mostly neutrons down there — hence the name — but there are also a few surviving protons floating around. Normally, those protons would repel one another, being like-minded charges and all, but they are forced close together as the Strong Nuclear Force tries to bunch them up with their fellow neutrons.The neutron star's interior is a complicated dance of physics under extreme conditions, resulting in very odd structures. The oddity starts near the surface, with blobs of a few hundred neutrons that are best described as neutron gnocchi. Below that, the neutron blobs glue together into long chains. We have entered the spaghetti layer. Underneath that, at even more extreme pressures, the spaghetti strands fuse side by side and form lasagna sheets. Under it all, even neutron lasagna loses its shape, becoming a uniform mass. But that mass has gaps in it, in the form of long tubes. At last: delicious penne.I wish I were making these names up, but physicists must be especially hungry people when coming up with metaphors. Did I mention the spinning? Oh yes, neutron stars spin, up to a few hundred times per second. Let all of this sink in for a bit: An object with such strong gravity that "hills" are barely a few millimeters tall, rotating with a speed that could rival your kitchen blender. We're not playing games anymore.Neutron stars are scaryAll this action — the insane densities, the complicated structures, the ridiculously fast rotation rates — means that neutron stars carry some pretty nasty magnetic fields. But don't magnetic fields require charged particles, and aren't neutrons neutral? That's true, smartypants, but there are still a few protons hanging out in the star, and at these incredible densities, physics gets … complicated. So, yes: Neutron stars, despite their name, can carry magnetic fields.How strong? Take a star's normal magnetic field, and squish it down. Every time you squish, you get a stronger field, just as you get higher densities. And we're squishing something from star-size (a million kilometers or miles, take your pick) to city-size (like, 25 kilometers — just 15 miles). Plus, with all the interesting physics happening in the interiors, complex processes can operate to amplify the magnetic field, so you can imagine just how strong those fields get.Actually, you don't have to imagine, because I'm about to tell you. Let's start with something familiar: the Earth's magnetic field. That's around 1 gauss. It’s not much different for the sun: a few to a few hundred gauss, depending on where on the surface you are. An MRI? 10,000 gauss. The strongest human-made magnetic fields are about a few hundred thousand gauss. In fact, we can't make magnetic fields stronger than a million gauss or so without our machines just breaking down from the stress.Let's cut to the chase: A neutron star carries a whopping trillion-gauss magnetic field. You read that right — "trillion," with a "t."If you're a topical expert — researcher, business leader, author or innovator — and would like to contribute an op-ed piece, email us here.Enter the magnetarNow, we finally get to magnetars. You may guess from the name that they're especially magnetic: up to 1 quadrillion gauss. That's 1,000 trillion times stronger than the magnetic field you're sitting in right now. That puts magnetars in the No. 1 spot, reigning champions in the universal Strongest Magnetic Field competition. The numbers are there, but it's hard to wrap our brains around them. Those fields are strong enough to wreak havoc on their local environments. You know how atoms are made of a positively charged nucleus surrounded by negatively charged electrons? Those charges respond to magnetic fields. Not very much under normal conditions, but this ain't Kansas anymore, is it, Toto? Any unlucky atoms stretch into pencil-thin rods near these magnetars.It doesn't stop there. With the atoms all screwed up, normal molecular chemistry is just a no-go. Covalent bonds? Ha! And the magnetic fields can drive enormous bursts of high-intensity radiation. So, generally bad business. Get too close to one (say, within 1,000 kilometers, or about 600 miles), and the magnetic fields are strong enough to upset not just your bioelectricity — rendering your nerve impulses hilariously useless — but your very molecular structure. In a magnetar's field, you just kind of … dissolve. We're not exactly sure what makes magnetars so frighteningly magnetic. Like I said, the physics of neutron stars is a little bit sketchy. It does seem, though, that magnetars don't last long, and after 10,000 years (give or take), they settle down into a long-term normal neutron-star retirement: still insanely dense, still freaky magnetic, just…not so bad. So, as scary as they are, at least they won’t stay that way for long.Learn more by listening to the episode "What the heck is a magnetar?" on the "Ask A Spaceman" podcast, available on iTunes and on the Web at http://www.askaspaceman.com.

http://www.cagesideseats.com/wwe/2014/12/31/7472713/wwe-edge-christian-multi-million-dollar-lawsuit-kayfabe	WWE reports Edge & Christian have filed a MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR lawsuit against the company	Of course it's an angle.During last night's episode of Main Event, Edge made mention of the fact that he couldn't sleep after what happened on Monday Night Raw with Seth Rollins and Big Show. Because of that, he had an entire team of lawyers and if anything else happened he would own WWE.Later, it was announced that Edge & Christian filed a lawsuit against the company.From WWE.com:The Authority resumes power this Monday on Raw, E&C will be in charge of SmackDown this Friday. According to Michael Cole, the duo filed a multi-million dollar lawsuit against WWE for the actions of Seth Rollins and Big Show last night on Raw.According to some spoilers for SmackDown this coming Friday night, this situation will be addressed during the opening segment. However, it does not seem to indicate any resolution, an interesting point considering neither Edge nor Christian are regular characters on WWE television.So what's the point of running a lawsuit angle? It's possible -- and this is just speculation -- it's a rib on the UFC for the recent lawsuits filed by former and current fighters against the mixed martial arts organization.Perhaps Edge & Christian will become regulars, if only for a few weeks. Or maybe the entire matter will be dropped in a week and quickly forgotten about.Stay tuned.
http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/11/29/small-business-saturday/3785883/	Small Business Saturday fosters mom-and-pop shopping	Where you buy affects your local economy.Black Friday and, increasingly, Thanksgiving night are for big-box retailers with thousands of stores, but Theresa Mitchell says Saturday is the day for businesses like hers.Mitchell and her mother, Jan Stewart, own The Bath Cottage, a 36-year-old bed and bath retailer in Cocoa, Fla.COLUMN: Bookstores benefit from Small Biz Sat STORY: Small Business Saturday is a big hit"Small business is something that Americans are losing sight of with Internet buying and big box stores," Mitchell said. "Some people are forgetting that small businesses are very much a part of their community."This Saturday is Small Business Saturday, a day set aside since 2010 between Black Friday and Cyber Monday to encourage shoppers to spend their holiday money at local mom-and-pop stores on clothing, jewelry, toys, accessories and other merchandise.Tramarea Adams' clothing store, Golden Glam Boutique in Jackson, Miss., doesn't have a million-dollar advertising budget. But like the Macy's and JCPenney stores across the USA, it needs a steady stream of customers.Golden Glam opened about a year ago, so this is Adams' first chance to promote her store through Small Business Saturday. Her Heels, Ties and Toys event will spotlight not only her store's clothing but also serve as a toy drive for a local shelter for abused women and children."This year, a lot of people have committed to shopping with us," she said. Golden Glam is opening an hour earlier than usual.More than 9 in 10 small-business owners nationally give back to their communities in some way, be it working with nonprofits, coaching youth sports teams or holding public office, said Ron Aldridge, Mississippi director of the nonprofit nonpartisan National Federation of Independent Business.STORY: Online is bigger than Black Friday STORY: Did shoppers buy on Black Friday?In Springfield, Mo., 5 Pound Apparel gives back by selling only items that help a charitable cause. It doesn't eschew Black Friday — the store had a line stretching down the block before it opened at 6 a.m. CT Friday — but Bryan Simpson, owner of the clothing retailer, said he has different strategies for each day's customers.American Express, which started Small Business Saturday in part to help small retailers during the economic downturn; the NFIB; and the federal Small Business Administration estimate that nearly 70 million customers spent $5.5 billion nationwide last year at small, independent stores during the event."It's the buying-local concept, that personalized service, that circle of money that stays more in the community," Aldridge said. "You're helping take care of your friends that you know in the community."Before the recession, a small-scale study in the Chicago neighborhood of Andersonville found that more than two-thirds of the money customers spent with local companies remained in the Chicago economy; 57 cents of every dollar spent at chain stores left the Chicago area, according to Civic Economics, economic development consultants with offices in Chicago and Austin.Nationally, market share for local retailers vs. national chains declined from 59% in 1990 to 48% in 2009, according to another Civic Economics study. For bars and restaurants, local market share dipped to 64% from 71%.Local businesses provide "jobs for our residents and members of our community," said shopper Kristi Hilliard of Macon, Ga., who says she always tries to support retailers in her area because of the personalized service and the boost to central Georgia's economy. "If those businesses close, then those people would lose their jobs."A cluster of small businesses on the courthouse square is the economic foundation of historic Canton, Miss., a city of about 13,000 people north of Jackson, Miss. Small Business Saturday is Day 2 of the city's three-day Merchants Open House; participating busineses are staying open extra hours and offering robust discounts."We're a small, family-owned business that's been here for 65 years," said Alice Jean Hawkins, co-owner of Noble-Watts Jewelers & Gifts. "So many of the stores on the square are family owned and operated, so it's an important day for a lot of us." More than three dozen of the city's businesses are participating.The National Federation of Independent Business said more than 350 retailers across the USA have registered at its website as participants. American Express is offering a $10 statement credit, down from $25 last year, to cardholders who register at its website and shop at participating retailers. Thousands of businesses have registered at the American Express site; both sites have maps of participating shops, restaurants and service providers.The movement has gained momentum through the use of social media, and in this fourth year businesses and shoppers are being encouraged to tweet using the hashtags #SmallBizSat and #ShopSmall. On Facebook, the Small Business Saturday page now has 3.3 million likes. Customers using Foursquare, the location-based mobile service, to check in at businesses receive recommendations for nearby participating shops and restaurants.Though a credit-card company started Small Business Saturday, Aldridge said shoppers can help their local businesses more if they use cash or a personal check. Debit and credit cards generate fees that businesses have to pay from the proceeds of a sale, and those fees generally go out of state.Lisa Curatolo, who owns The Goat Boy gift shop in Owego, N.Y., said the day has had a positive effect on her business in years past."Even though it is one day, there's a pour-over for weeks from that," she said. "For a community to really survive and do well, we need all the businesses to do well. So we really need to raise awareness of every business that's down here."Contributing: Wayne T.

He led al-Qaida's branch in Iraq during the U.S.-led war there, but his chapter was disavowed for its extremely bloody attacks. It later became the Islamic State group after seizing territory in Syria and Iraq and declaring a self-styled "caliphate."Q: WHAT HAPPENED TO AL-BAGHDADI?A: An Interior Ministry intelligence official told The Associated Press that an Iraqi airstrike Saturday wounded al-Baghdadi during a meeting in the town of Qaim, near the Syrian border in Iraq's western Anbar province. The official cited informants within the militant group. A senior Iraqi military official also told the AP he learned in operational meetings that al-Baghdadi had been wounded.Q: WHAT DOES IRAQ SAY NOW?View gallery This undated file image posted on a militant website on Jan. 14, 2014, which has been verified and i …A: Iraq's Defense and Interior ministries both said Sunday that al-Baghdadi had been wounded. On Monday, Iraqi military spokesman Saad Maan Ibrahim walked back from the earlier Defense Ministry claim, telling the AP: "The investigation is ongoing into the possible injury of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi." He added that several prominent Islamic State group leaders were killed in the attack, but did not name them.Q: WHERE IS AL-BAGHDADI?A: No one knows for sure. Rami Abdurrahman, director of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said some Islamic State militants wounded in the airstrike near Qaim were taken across the frontier to the Syrian border town of Boukamal. He didn't know if al-Baghdadi was among them.Q: HOW WILL AL-BAGHDADI BEING REPORTEDLY WOUNDED AFFECT THE ISLAMIC STATE GROUP?A: Analysts believe Islamic State militants likely will continue their offensive, though its morale could be shaken as the strike reportedly killed other top leaders in the group.Q: HOW IS THE BATTLE AGAINST THE ISLAMIC STATE GOING NOW?A: On Monday, U.S. Central Command said the U.S.-led coalition conducted 18 airstrikes in Iraq from Saturday to Monday, including two in Qaim that destroyed an Islamic State group armored vehicle and two militant checkpoints. Britain's Defense Ministry also said Monday it used one of its Reaper drone for the first time in the campaign against the extremists in Iraq.___Vivian Salama is the AP's Baghdad bureau chief.

http://www.aol.com/article/2014/11/27/suicide-bomber-kills-five-in-attack-on-british-embassy-car-in-k/20999959/	Suicide bomber kills five in attack on British embassy car in Kabul: officials	(Reuters) - A suicide bomber attacked a British embassy vehicle in the Afghan capital on Thursday, killing five people including one Briton, officials said.The blast in the east of Kabul wounded 33 people, including many bystanders, the latest in a wave of bombings to hit the city as the majority of foreign combat troops prepare to withdraw from the country by the end of the year.Taliban insurgents, who were ousted from power by a U.S.-led coalition in 2001, claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it "targeted foreign invading forces".Attacks aimed at foreign embassy personnel are less common than the near-daily strikes against Afghan and international military forces on the country's roads.Britain said that two embassy personnel, including one British national, were among the five killed."I am deeply saddened to confirm that a British national civilian security team member and an Afghan national working for the embassy were killed in the incident," Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said in a statement, adding that another Briton had been injured.A Reuters witness saw at least one survivor being led away from the charred shell of the vehicle on foot by a member of the British security force.SPATE OF KABUL ATTACKSG4S, the world's biggest security firm, later confirmed one of its staff had been killed in the blast and another injured."Next of kin have been informed and we will continue to provide them with support," a company spokesperson said."Our thoughts and most heartfelt condolences are with the families, friends and colleagues of those involved in this tragic incident."The interior ministry initially reported the blast was caused by a suicide bomber on a motorcycle, but later said the attacker was traveling by car.Thursday's bombing was at least the fourth in Kabul since Monday, when two American soldiers were killed in a powerful blast close to the airport.While not common, attacks against diplomatic missions and personnel in Afghanistan show a determination to target anyone associated with the U.S.-led mission.A 25-year-old American diplomat was killed last year in an attack on a convoy in the country's east.The Indian consulate in the western province of Herat was attacked in May by insurgents with rocket-propelled grenades and suicide vests. Last year, the U.S. consulate in Herat was also attacked with a truck bomb.More from AOL.com: Early bird shoppers turn out on Thanksgiving Protests break out near Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade Families asked to host visitors for pope's US trip

http://www.sbnation.com/soccer/2014/12/8/7353461/lionel-messi-cristiano-ronaldo-real-madrid-barcelona	Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo definitely hate each other	Could this weekend's game of one-upsmanship have come from anything other than a nasty rivalry?Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are the two best footballers in the world. They are, perhaps, the two best footballers who have ever lived. They play at the two biggest clubs in the world, which happen to be fierce rivals. And even though they're careful to never say anything derogatory about each other, it doesn't appear to be out of mutual respect. Everything about Messi and Ronaldo's interactions with each other is pretty weird.It's very rare to hear one seriously compliment the other, but they never talk trash. They almost pretend the other doesn't exist. If asked a direct question about their natural rival, Messi and Ronaldo both say something to the effect of "[Messi/Ronaldo] is a great player, but I'm just focused on myself and winning trophies for [Barcelona/Real Madrid]." They're rehearsed, and perfectly so.This is why it was so interesting when Guillem Balague wrote that Ronaldo refers to Messi as 'motherf***er' behind his back, and that he also refers to any Madrid player who speaks to Messi as 'motherf***er'. This forced Ronaldo to issue a denial, in which he stated "I have the utmost respect for all my professional colleagues, and Messi is obviously no exception." As usual, he acted like Messi was just any other non-Madrid player to him.But Messi is not just any non-Madrid player to Ronaldo, and Ronaldo is not just any non-Barcelona player to Messi. We don't have to ask them to know this, and asking them would be useless anyway, since they've made it very clear how they respond to questions about the other being their rival. They hate each other, each wants to prove they're better than the other, and they know their legacies will be defined by the trophies and individual honors they collect while they're the faces of Real Madrid and Barcelona, respectively.On Saturday, Ronaldo set two records: Most hat tricks in La Liga history and fastest to 200 goals in La Liga. How much faster he got to 200 goals than the guys he was chasing is jarring, as is how quickly he scored 23 hat tricks. And, perhaps most importantly to fans, that meant Ronaldo had three more hat tricks than Messi.Messi let Ronaldo have the spotlight for one day. He scored his 21st La Liga hat trick Sunday, and in spectacular fashion. His hat trick was also so much more than three goals -- he dominated Espanyol, setting up more chances for others than he created for himself. It was the kind of truly dominant performance that we haven't seen regularly from Messi since the 2011-12 season.Seriously, look at this pass to Jordi Alba.His first goal was an absolutely ridiculous, a perfectly placed skipping rocket from 20 yards, scored after he made a handful of defenders look foolish.And then there's this one, the best of the bunch, which he essentially created for himself. When's the last time we saw him turn on the jets and go on an individual run like this?This wasn't Messi magically coming to life because he was so motivated for a Catalan Derby, or just a rare game he happened to be fully fit for over the last couple of seasons. This was, undoubtedly, a response to Ronaldo. He saw what Ronaldo did, he saw the kind of praise Ronaldo was getting for his accomplishments, and he got pissed off.Messi and Ronaldo choose not to trash talk because it wouldn't be a good look for the shoe companies, clothing companies and drink companies that pay them tens of millions of dollars. They enjoy being fabulously rich, because being fabulously rich is awesome.They keep their mouths shut, but Ronaldo definitely thinks that Messi is a motherf***er. Messi thinks that Ronaldo is a motherf***er, too. Just because they've never said that word or any other one like it out loud doesn't mean that's not how they feel. These guys dislike each other and want to beat each other to every accolade just as much as the fiercest individual rivals anyone can remember.They're playing a lifelong game of H.O.R.S.E., sneakily throwing up middle fingers at each other when no one is looking, and it's the best sports rivalry of a generation.
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/12/05/family-cuts-open-dead-shark-to-save-her-unborn-pups/21003521/	Family cuts open dead shark to save her unborn pups	Astonishing footage shows the incredible moment a man cut open a deceased, pregnant shark to free her unborn pups.Restaurant owners Beth Cordell, 44, and Lindsey Cordell, 44, were walking along the coast in Georgia when they spotted a shark that washed up on shore.Mr. Cordell said: "We noticed the shark had a hook stuck in it -- we wanted to remove it because we didn't want anyone passing by to get hurt on it. We were the first ones to see it -- but a crowd formed around it very quickly."Photo courtesy Beth Cordell / Barcroft MediaWith the help of other beachgoers, they started removing the hook, but noticed movement inside the 6-foot shark's stomach.Mr. Cordell, from Rome, Georgia, said: "The shark started moving like crazy -- we quickly realized that it was pregnant and its pups were still alive."One man in the crowd volunteered to cut the shark open with a knife and attempt to rescue the pups.Their 13-year-old son, also named Lindsey, started recording as the man began performed the incredible emergency C-section.After several attempts to locate the babies, the man successfully exposed the wriggling newborns inside the mother.Carefully avoiding the shark's teeth, they successfully rescued and released three pups.Mr. Cordell said: "I've never experienced anything like this before -- it was definitely a crazy experience.""Last year while walking with my family on the shore we witnessed baby sea turtles hatching -- this shark birth definitely beats that."Speaking of sharks, have you ever seen the cookie cutter variety? You definitely wouldn't want to get too close to this mouth:

He did not say why. A "Late Show" representative could not be reached for comment.Another canceled booking, on "The Queen Latifah Show" on Oct. 30, was characterized by that show as a postponement granted at Cosby's request.Barbara Bowman, one of Cosby's accusers, has recently leveled allegations of sexual assault by the comic in interviews and in a Washington Post online column, writing that "Cosby won my trust as a 17-year-old aspiring actress in 1985, brainwashed me into viewing him as a father figure, and then assaulted me multiple times."The standup comedian Hannibal Buress last month brought heat on Cosby at a performance in Philadelphia. His routine, during which he assailed Cosby as "a rapist," was captured on video and posted online, gaining wide exposure.The 77-year-old Cosby, who was never criminally charged in any of the cases, settled a civil suit in 2006 with another woman over an alleged incident two years before.Cosby has declined to comment on the recent resurgence of allegations.More from AOL.com: Mario Lopez answers 10 questions on running BET cancels 106 & Park after 14 years Brooke Shields reveals she lost her virginity to Dean Cain

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/science-says-couples-one-habit-135700431.html	Science Says Couples With One Habit Stay Together Longer	They're grateful.Regularly taking a moment to stop and show your partner you're thankful for her small acts of kindness — be they taking out the trash or fixing your computer — can make both of you feel more satisfied and strengthen your relationship.Psychologists didn't start systematically studying gratitude — let alone its impact on romantic relationships — until the early 2000s. Before then, most of the research in the field focused on negative emotions and the problems that either produced or stemmed from these feelings.But a decade of social science research suggests that partners who show they care about the little things activate a two-way feedback system that helps both members of a relationship feel closer and more fulfilled.Two psychologists, University of California, Davis’ Robert Emmons and University of Miami's Michael McCullough spearheaded most of the early research on gratitude's effects.In one of of their studies, the researchers had volunteers keep weekly journals in which they wrote about particular topics. One group wrote about major events that had happened that week. Another group wrote about hassles they'd experienced. The last group wrote about things they were grateful for. Ten weeks later, those in the gratitude group reported feeling more optimistic and more satisfied with their lives than those in any of the other groups. They also reported fewer physical symptoms of discomfort, from runny noses to headaches, and exercised more.Years later, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill psychologist Sara Algoe took those same feelings of gratefulness and studied how they might affect not just one person, but couples in romantic relationships. For her study, Algoe also had couples keep a diary (just like Emmons and McCullough had). Instead of recording anything they felt grateful for, however, Algoe had her participants list things their partner had done that made them feel grateful, along with how each act of kindness made them feel. Participants also kept track of kind acts they directed toward their partner, and how those made them feel.Over the course of 1,768 days of reports, participants reported that their partner did something thoughtful for them nearly 700 times, while they reported doing something thoughtful for their partner slightly less often (601 times). But there was a sad twist: Nearly half of the attempted acts of kindness went undetected by the other person. What mattered, it turned out, wasn't how often someone in the relationship did a thoughtful thing — it was how grateful the partner reported feeling about it.Volunteers were more connected to their partners and more satisfied with their relationship on the days when they reported feeling more grateful for their partners' acts of kindness. And those feelings of gratitude — more important than any acts of kindness alone — lasted into the following day.Couples who took a moment to show they cared about their partner's efforts got a temporary mood boost. But showing gratitude, it turns out, can also have a lasting impact on relationships.In a series of studies, University of California, Berkeley psychologist Amie Gordon found that the more grateful couples were, the more likely they were to still be in the relationship nine months down the road.Gordon's research had one crucial caveat, though: Expressing gratitude isn't confined solely to saying "thank you" for a kind deed. Being grateful, she writes in a blog post for Psychology Today,is about feeling lucky to have a caring partner in the first place. "My definition of gratitude includes appreciating not just what your partner does, but who they are as a person. You're not just thankful that your partner took out the trash — you're thankful that you have a partner who is thoughtful enough to know you hate taking out the trash."Happy couples can make it seem like it all comes naturally, but in reality any strong, quality relationship requires a hefty amount of work. If you want to make your relationship stronger — and you're willing to put in the effort — gratitude itself can help you and your partner feel happier and more connected.All of this is based on the idea that gratitude itself can generate more positive thinking. Recent research, including dozens of studies done in individuals and couples, appears to back up this notion. Of course, while gratitude can be used to help strengthen a healthy relationship, it shouldn't be used as a means of justifying staying in an unhealthy one.Gratitude is contagious, Gordon's research found. It produces a cascade of feelings and behaviors, many of which also happen to be critical to strengthening a relationship. When you actively think about your partner's caring qualities, you begin to think about how much he or she means to you.Partners who regularly think of each other as valuable and important, it turns out, behave in ways that reflect those feelings.Imagine stopping for a moment to think about the last time your girlfriend took care of you when you were sick. The next time she says something to you, you might listen more carefully, either because you want to return the favor or because you've actively made yourself aware of how important she is to you.Either way, she'll likely notice, and she'll feel more appreciated as a result.When someone feels appreciated by their partner, they in turn appreciate the partner more too, creating something of a happy cycle. In long-term relationships, it's those simple behaviors that can make all of the work worthwhile.More From Business InsiderHere's The Key To Date Nights That Make Both People Happy Scientists Have Found A Surprising Key To Happy Relationships 5 Ways To Tell If Someone Is Cheating On You
http://www.voanews.com/content/ukraine/2504946.html	Ukraine Awaits Results of Controversial Election	Pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine have voted in controversial elections that Kyiv and the West say they will not recognize.  The separatists who control parts of eastern Ukraine's Luhansk and Donetsk regions held elections Sunday for leadership and legislative bodies in the areas they control.Quoting election officials of the so-called Donetsk People's Republic, or DNR, Russian news agencies reported that with more than 50 percent of the ballots cast counted, Alexander Zakharchenko, the acting DNR prime minister, was in the lead in the contest to become DNR leader, with more than 70 percent of the vote.International condemnation The United Nations, the European Union and the United States have called the rebel vote illegal, saying it violates Ukraine's constitution and the cease-fire agreement reached September 5 between separatists and Ukraine's government.The EU's new foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said Sunday that the bloc would not recognize the vote, which she called "a new obstacle on the path towards peace in Ukraine."Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko called the election in the separatist regions "a farce that is being conducted under the threat of tanks and guns."Russia to respect rebel vote results Russia's Foreign Ministry released a statement late Sunday saying it respected the separatist vote as an expression of the will of the inhabitants of southeastern Ukraine, Russian news agencies reported.The ministry also said that in light of the election, "it is extremely important to take active steps to establish a sustainable dialogue" between Ukraine's central government and the separatists in line with cease-fire agreement signed between the two sides on September 5.   EU leaders have urged Russia to ignore those results. Western officials say the vote could further complicate efforts to end the crisis in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Moscow rebels want to join Russia.  Even with the two-month-old cease-fire, there have been daily outbreaks of fighting in some parts of eastern Ukraine.Troop movementsEarlier Sunday, the Ukrainian military said there was "intensive" movement of troops and weapons from Russia into separatist-controlled areas in eastern Ukraine where the voting was taking place.News agencies reported seeing columns of unmarked military trucks, some with anti-aircraft guns, heading toward the government-held airport in rebel-held Donetsk, but it was unclear whether they were new or existing forces in the rebel-held region.The election in eastern Ukraine comes a week after parliamentary elections were held throughout the remainder of Ukraine, with candidates favoring closer ties with other European countries winning a significant plurality of the seats. People living in the east did not vote in the October 26 balloting.After casting his vote Sunday, the DNR's acting prime minister, Alexander Zakharchenko, said if Kyiv would recognize the pro-Russian separatist region, an economic relationship could be normalized."If they recognize us [Donetsk People's Republic] and return our lost land without a fight, then we will restore normal economic ties [with Ukraine] and will live like equal economic partners," he said.The United Nations says more than 4,000 people have died in the fighting between Ukrainian government forces and pro-Russia rebels.

That needs to happen in the very near future."Alfonso made the announcement after his impressive rumba routine with partner Witney Carson, which earned them an almost perfect score from the judges.But fans on Twitter were too preoccupied with the baby news to comment much on the routine, sending their congratulations and well wishes to the expectant parents.
http://www.latimes.com/sports/nba/la-sp-nba-lebron-cavaliers-20141221-story.html	Young teammates see LeBron James as somewhat of a sage	An hour after Cleveland suffered its worst defeat of the season, a 29-point blowout to Atlanta on Wednesday night, LeBron James sat in a chair on the baseline with a cold drink in his hand and watched his young teammate, point guard Kyrie Irving, work on his craft.The cameras caught James looking on admiringly as the 22-year-old Irving went through shooting drills with the Cavaliers' assistant coaches. When it was over, Irving and James shared a moment, the two of them nodding and smiling.James and the Cavaliers are nearly one-third of the way into the season, and so far he has been a patient instructor to his teammates, who view the four-time NBA most valuable player as their sage."He's been doing that every day," Cleveland assistant coach Larry Drew said. "It's not just in games, but in our practices, our shoot-arounds, our film sessions. For LeBron, because he's won championships, he's teaching these guys what it takes to get there.""I think we can compete against anybody when we're playing at our best," James said after the Atlanta game. "But it's going to take us maintaining our focus every single day because we cannot afford to take a step backward."So James talks to his teammates about practicing hard, being selfless, how to cope with adversity, about living and playing in a media bubble and dealing with the high expectations placed on the Cavaliers this season."He definitely had to be patient because we have some great pieces and some great players, but four of our top six players have never been to the playoffs," said Tyronn Lue, Cleveland's associate head coach.Two of those players are All-Stars Irving and Kevin Love, who missed the postseason in his six seasons with Minnesota. The other two players are key reserves Dion Waiters and Tristan Thompson.Lue said that James has grown as a player after spending the last four seasons living under the microscope in Miami, where he won two NBA championships and went to four consecutive NBA Finals.It's that maturity, Lue said, that has helped James push his teammates the right way."It's also a situation where LeBron has to be patient but also demand a lot," Lue said. "It's a fine line because he has a team that's real good and he can see the talent and the potential."James, who turns 30 on Dec. 30, is in his 12th season in the NBA, and there have been some rumblings that he has peaked as a player.In his first 23 games this season with Cleveland, James' numbers have declined slightly from last season in Miami. He's shooting 49.4% from the field (56.7% last season), while averaging 25.4 points (27.1), 5.4 rebounds (6.9) and 3.7 turnovers (3.5).James lost some weight over the summer, dropping to a listed 250 pounds, considerably less than his rumored weight of 270 pounds last season in Miami."I don't see that much of a loss of step at all," said an Eastern Conference scout about James. The scout, who is not authorized to speak publicly, sees only a slight decline in James' athleticism. "I think it's an adjustment of playing at a new weight. Maybe his vertical isn't as high, but it's still really, really high."Whenever James does show his age on the court, Lue expects him to duplicate the approach taken by Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan."When Jordan slowed down and when Kobe slowed down, they became more mid-range game players," Lue said. "I think LeBron will be the same way."He's so fast and so strong. You continue to play to your strength. When he slows down, he'll be a better post-up guy, better mid-range guy, instead of going to the hole and getting beat up."Meanwhile, the immediate challenge for James and the Cavaliers is to keep improving and become the best team in the East.Charles Barkley, the Hall of Famer who is an analyst for TNT, complains that James has been "a little too passive."Barkley recalled how James deferred to Dwyane Wade in their first season together in Miami in 2010-11. Barkley also recalled that when he was traded to the Phoenix Suns in 1992 that he initially deferred to Kevin Johnson and Dan Majerle.At some point, Barkley said, James has to tell all the Cavaliers, "It's my team.""Hey, listen. I like Kyrie and I like Kevin, but if I'm LeBron, I tell them, 'I'm going this way. Y'all follow me,' " Barkley said. "He went through the exact same thing in Miami, so that's why I'd like to see LeBron be a little more aggressive."The best player has to be the best player. The best player can't let other guys get off. And look, LeBron James is still the best player in the world. No question."
https://www.yahoo.com/parenting/how-it-feels-to-be-a-kid-on-welfare-104765206998.html	How It Feels to Be a Kid on Welfare	Photo Credit: iStockBy Brenda Della CasaNot too long ago, I woke up, grabbed my iPhone and popped onto Facebook to see what I had missed since falling asleep. What can I say other than I play on social media like it’s my job. Normally my news feed is full of baby photos, food, travel shots and the occasional questionable joke. On this particular morning, I was faced with a photo of a food stamp with a note to “those on welfare” who “don’t work” and “milk the system.” The post was calling for “accountability.” I just shook my head in disappointment.While most political comments don’t hit me very hard (we all have a right to our opinion), I have a difficult time with those that group any set of people into a section and blame and berate them. It’s especially disturbing when people I know make these kinds of statements and then look me in the eye and say it to me as though I’m above some kind of fray. Quite frankly, it makes me sick to my stomach. Yes, there are people who abuse all kinds of systems, regardless of their tax bracket, but too often I hear people equate poverty with laziness or worse, criminal behavior and it’s heart-wrenching for me on a deeply personal level.More from YourTango: 10 Ways Smart Women Choose To Be HappyMy less-than-humble beginningsI have made no secret that I come from way down. I grew up in various cockroach-infested apartments with a violent, drug-addicted ex-felon father and a mother who did me both a favor and a great disservice by leaving. The only person I had to watch over me to make sure that I had food, water, and ice for my wounds was my beloved, hardworking, retired grandfather who supported me with a $500 monthly budget that was paid to him via pension and social security.That included rent money.When we lost our home (thanks to my father skipping bail) we moved into our fishing trailer and ate pork and beans nearly every weeknight for dinner. On weekends, we lived lakeside and ate the fish we caught. Finally, after we had to spend one third of our income on my eyeglasses, we went to sign up for food stamps and stood in line for our boxed block of “government cheese.” For a former foreman and a little girl who was already made fun of for a number of reasons and who was particularly sensitive to her grandfather’s feelings, it was humiliating.I hated seeing my proud and dignified hero standing in line for handouts. This was a man who prided himself on being self-sufficient and instilled a sense of duty and independence in me from day one. We were not drug addicts living the high life; we were just poor."You will be educated and life will be better for you when you get older, Brenda Lynn," he promised. He was going to fight like hell to see that it happened. "You just need to go to college and you’ll never have to go through this again." But I was five years old. We had a few years, hospital trips, pairs of shoes, and meals to worry about.My grandfather had a moral fiber as thick as wool. He was a God-fearing man who treated everyone with dignity and respect, volunteered to help others, worked odd jobs to make money for us and taught me to also treat everyone with dignity and respect reminding me that, “We are all equal, and we all put our pants on one leg at a time.” He may not personally have agreed with your way of life, but he’d certainly vote for your right to live as you saw fit as long as it didn’t hurt anyone else.He tipped his hat to women on the street. He firmly shook the hands of men. He opened doors. He gave what he had to help others, and he kept his word. He pressed and polished our cheap clothes and shoes to make us look as nice as possible. He didn’t smoke, drink or do drugs. He paid his taxes on time.My grandfather wanted what all good, decent and loving fathers want for their daughters — the best, safest and most dignified life. While he’d have to save up for a few months to buy me a new dress at Sears in order to see the bright surprise flash across my face, I believe we were rich. Very few children enjoyed the conversation, love, companionship and connection we had. Having a hamburger and slice of pie once a week was our “big date” when we could afford it and believe me when I tell you that there is still no better “date” for me today.I was raised to believe in hard work, the value of education, human interaction, honoring your word, equality and making your own way in this world and helping others. When he passed away, everything beautiful in my world went with him.I was bounced from home to home and turned to the system only once when I was cold and needed somewhere to sleep over Thanksgiving. I walked into Juvenile Hall and asked to stay there. Those two days were enough time for me to realize that I needed to stay under the radar. God knows it would have been easier to have food stamps or medical insurance to offer someone to take me in, but I had to make due without both. On the occasion that I needed to go to the doctor, I went to Planned Parenthood —not to exercise my right to choose, but for breast exams and free medical attention in a facility that treated me like a human being.When I tried to work at 14, I was told I wasn’t old enough to get a full-time job so I worked under the table when I could and accepted food, clothes and shelter from those who felt sorry for me. Equally humiliating.When it was time to go to college, I had the grades and essays to get in, but I was under 24 and that meant that I needed a parental signature.I was on my own and never a ward of the court, a painful purgatory for someone who ached to just get to the starting line like everyone else.More from YourTango: I Was Abused As A Child, And This Is My StoryWelfare literally saved my life Thanks to President Clinton, an amendment was made making it possible for kids who had been on their own and who had stayed out of the system (i.e., bounced from home to home or on the streets) to apply for loans on their own and go to school. With that, a scholarship and loans, I attended American University and eventually, interned at the White House.In the time since childhood and now, I have made an incredible family of friends who are on both sides of the political fence. Some of my friends feel very strongly about helping others whereas others feel we should all be responsible only for helping ourselves. I personally believe in God and God said that we should stear clear of judging others unless we want to be judged ourselves. I believe God judges deception, bigotry, cruelty and those who live their lives in ways that bring pain to others.You may not agree with me and that’s okay; we don’t have to. But I will still show you respect, not only because that’s how I was raised but because it feels right on a deep and human level.I am writing this because I want to say that I was one of those “welfare” people so many people callously group into the “lazy” section of the room. While I’m now often told by these same people that I am one of the hardest working people they know, the reality is that there is no way I would be where I am today without the help I received in my past. Some tell me, “Yeah, but you are an exception.”No, I am not.I’m just one of the many people born under difficult circumstances who wanted to do better and needed a little help getting onto my feet. Now that I am on them, I do my best not to forget what it felt like when I was not. If anything, my past has benefited me in that it has served as a strong warning not to play the “we vs. them” game as one day you might be the “them.”More from YourTango: Do You Have What It Takes To Be Happy?

The head of the city's police union said de Blasio's statement "threw cops under the bus."Speaking on ABC's "This Week" with George Stephanopoulos on Sunday, de Blasio said there was "so much misunderstanding" about what he meant."What parents have done for decades who have children of color, especially young men of color, is train them to be very careful when they have a connection with a police officer," de Blasio said."It's different for a white child. That's just the reality in this country," de Blasio went on. "And with Dante, very early on with my son, we said, look, if a police officer stops you, do everything he tells you to do, don't move suddenly, don't reach for your cell phone, because we knew, sadly, there's a greater chance it might be misinterpreted if it was a young man of color."The lack of indictments in the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner has led to widespread protests and sparked a national conversation on police use of force, particularly when it comes to African-American men."I'm just saying what people are actually experiencing and have been for decades," de Blasio said Sunday. "I've talked to a lot of families of color, well before this time, because I've said things like this before. And they've said to me over and over and over again that they appreciate someone finally acknowledging that they have that conversation with their sons. It's a painful conversation. You can sense there's a contradiction in that conversation."
http://gma.yahoo.com/jet-carrying-myles-munroe-struck-shipyard-crane-bahamas-221400227--abc-news-topstories.html	Jet Carrying Myles Munroe Struck Shipyard Crane Before Bahamas Crash	A private jet carrying a prominent Bahamian pastor and eight others en route to a religious conference struck a shipyard crane and crashed into a recycling center about 4 miles from the airport, a top Bahamian official said.Dr. Myles Munroe and his wife Ruth, who were the co-leaders of the Bahamas Faith Ministries, were two of the nine people on board the plane that crashed Sunday evening. It appears that they were making their descent around the time of the crash.The private Lear Jet plane struck a shipping container crane as it tried to land in heavy rain, Foreign Minister Fred Mitchell told the Associated Pres today. Mitchell said that a commercial airline taking the same route as the private plane had turned back shortly before the accident because severe weather and heavy rain made it too dangerous for them to continue.The investigation into the fatal crash started this morning, but the Grand Bahamas Shipyard confirmed the site of the crash in a statement released this afternoon. It said the plane crashed at a recycling facility just east of the shipyard that is used to collect "recycled waste material, scrap metal and construction debris," the shipyard said in a statement.Bahamas Faith Ministries International released the identities of six of the other fatalities, three of whom were leaders in the church. The group's senior vice president Dr. Richard Pinder and two newly installed youth ministers -- Pastors Lavard and Radel Parks and their son, Johannan-- died in the crash. There was one other passenger who has still not been named. Other victims included pilot Frakhan Cooper and Munroe's longtime personal pilot Stanley Thurston and Farkhan Cooper."Words cannot express our profound sense of loss for all of the team members on this tragic flight," the group said in a statement. "Dr. Munroe was our visionary, our founder, our mentor, adviser, father figure and friend. He was a global leader and icon and was respected worldwide."Munroe was scheduled to give the opening address at the conference and Pinder was also slated to speak to the hundreds of followers gathered in Freeport for the four-day event."As a Church body and organization we will move forward as Dr. Munroe would have wanted us to. We recognize that there will be challenges but we have full confidence that God will see us through and we intend to make our founding leaders proud," Bahamas Faith Ministries International said in their new statement.Condolences poured in from Bahamian politicians and religious leaders, including Pat Robertson, the host of The 700 Club who had Munroe and his wife as guests on the show over the years."Myles Munroe was a great spiritual leader in the Bahamas, a gifted teacher, and we are saddened by his passing," Robertson said in a statement to ABC News.
http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2014/12/nasa-delays-orion-mars-capsule-launch-20141241301671775.html	NASA delays Orion spacecraft launch	The space capsule is aiming to travel for a distance of 57,800km [AP]NASA has postponed the launch of an unmanned spacecraft that is designed to help get humans to Mars, a mission touted as the first step in deep space exploration.The tiny Orion spacecraft was scheduled to blast off at 12:05 GMT on Thursday with the help of a Delta 4 Heavy rocket, known as the biggest booster rocket in the US fleet. However, weather condition and technical issues prompted several delays and final decision to reschedule the launch for 12:05 GMT on Friday."Today's planned launch of #Orion is postponed due to valve issue. Our next possible launch window opens at 7:05am ET Friday," NASA announced on its Twitter account on Thursday.Al Jazeera's Andy Gallacher, reporting from Kennedy Space Centre in Cape Canaveral, said that the delay was more of a frustrating start to Orion's historic launch than a disappointment."Technical issues, high winds and stray boats aside safety is a top proirity for the space agency and there is still a 25-day launch window for NASA's best new hope," said Gallacher.He said that at the Kennedy Space Center there was "a palpable sense of anticipation for what Orion could achieve and a sense that pride is back in the US space programme".The conical spacecraft looks similar to the Apollo capsule that took astronauts to the Moon in the 1960s and 1970s, but slightly larger and with modern electronics.NASA hopes to send an Orion crew to an asteroid corralled in lunar orbit in the 2020s and to Mars in the 2030s.'Exploring deep space'Earlier on Thursday, Mike Sarafin, the lead flight director stationed at Mission Control in Houston, Texas said:"We haven't had this feeling in a while, since the end of the shuttle programme. Launching an American spacecraft from American soil and beginning something new, in this case exploring deep space."The space capsule is aiming to travel for a distance of 57,800km, 14 times higher than the International Space Station.This high altitude will give it the momentum it needs for a 32,200-kph, 4,000-degree entry over the Pacific. Those crucial 11 minutes to splashdown is the critical part NASA calls the "trial by fire".The heat shield at Orion's base, at five metres across, is the largest of its kind ever built. Orion will land in the Pacific Ocean, 1,000km off the coast of Baja, California where recovery teams will retrieve the shuttle.NASA wants to experiment with the capsule’s most critical parts before it carries out astronauts.This $370m trial includes the heat shield, parachutes and all the sections jettisoned during ascent and entry.The capsule will also pass through extreme radiation in the Van Allen belts surrounding Earth, as engineers want to estimate the effects on the on-board computers.Lockheed Martin Corporation is managing the test flight for NASA.Sarafin's entire team at Johnson Space Center in Houston is comprised of former shuttle flight controllers.Gene Kranz, known as the legendary flight director of Apollo 11 and more, will be on hand in Mission Control on Friday.
http://www.cnet.com/news/happy-100th-birthday-hedy-lamarr-movie-star-and-wi-fi-inventor/#ftag=YHF65cbda0	Happy 100th birthday, Hedy Lamarr, movie star who paved way for Wi-Fi	This actress from Hollywood's Golden Age reminds us of a time when women were some of the leading unsung tech innovators.Hedy Lamarr, shown in this studio publicity still for the 1938 movie "Algiers," developed wireless technology still in use today.Hedy Lamarr, a Hollywood actress known for her good looks and classic come-hither bedroom gaze, also played a key role in developing cell phone technology widely used today.Born 100 years ago today in Vienna, the actress made a lesser-known contribution to wireless communication when she tried to defuse a potential military threat during World War II. To prevent remote-controlled torpedoes from being hijacked, she helped develop an early version of spread spectrum communication, which is part of the basis for wireless technologies such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.Her successes remind us that women were central to the invention of many technologies we appreciate today. Over the past year, many tech giants have released demographic figures showing just how few women, and minorities, are among their collective workforce. Changing those trends has become a central issue, particularly among educators and industry critics.Some of the debate has focused on convincing women to focus their time on STEM education, earning degrees in science, technology, engineering and math. But Lamarr is a reminder you don't have to be a tech whiz to change technology.Already a screen actress in Europe at age 18, Lamarr got her first exposure to applied science when she married Friedrich Mandl, an armaments manufacturer 14 years her senior. He was said to be extremely possessive and controlling of his younger bride. Mandl was reportedly so controlling that he forbade her from pursuing her film career and kept her a virtual prisoner in their home. It was during this time that Mandl demanded Lamarr accompany him to meetings with business associates where military technologies were discussed.After divorcing Mandl, Lamarr moved to Hollywood to resume her acting career, working with the likes of Clark Gable, Spencer Tracy and Lana Turner during MGM's "Golden Age," according to an "official" fan site biography. It was during this time that Lamarr met George Antheil, a composer, author and inventor Lamarr reportedly consulted on how to improve her figure.The topic of their conversations soon turned to radio-controlled torpedoes, a key WWII weapon that could be easily detected and jammed by broadcasting interference. Harnessing the torpedo knowledge she acquired from the meetings she attended with her former husband, Lamarr began collaborating with Antheil on frequency hopping, a method for rapidly switching among random synchronized frequencies.The pair's plan was to use a piano roll to randomly switch the signal sent from the control center to the torpedo in short bursts among 88 frequencies, much like the 88 keys on a piano's keyboard. The pair's "Secret Communications System" was granted US Patent No. 2,292,387 in 1942, but the technique was never adopted by the military during the war.The patent resurfaced in the 1950s while private companies were developing a wireless technology called CDMA. Lamarr's method is still in use today by cell networks, Bluetooth devices and Wi-Fi.Almost three years before Lamarr died in 2000, the Electronic Frontier Foundation gave her an award for her contribution to wireless communications.
https://www.yahoo.com/tech/s/apple-pay-already-having-significant-impact-one-major-132004691.html	Apple Pay is already having a significant impact at one major retailer	Apple fixed an annoying iPhone 6 bug that was ruining Apple Pay for some usersIf you’re looking for more evidence that Apple Pay is already a big success, look no further than a recent estimate put out by Mike Dudas, the cofounder of mobile payments rewards startup Button and a former executive at Google Wallet. Using data from both regulatory filings and from Whole Foods CIO Jason Buechel, Dudas estimates that Apple Pay has accounted for roughly 1% of all transactions at Whole Foods since its launch three weeks ago.RELATED: It only took Apple Pay a week to become more popular than all other NFC payment platforms combinedWhile 1% may not sound like much, it’s actually a surprisingly strong number given that Apple Pay is less than a month old and that mobile payments have never really made any significant dent in the percentages of total sales at major retailers. The 1% figure translates to roughly 150,000 transactions total, or around $6 million worth of goods if we assume all these transactions average $40 each, which Dudas says happens to be the average basket size of a Whole Foods shopping trip.According to a report by The Financial Times, Apple will make $0.15 for every $100 worth of goods that people buy with Apple Pay — that means that in just the past three or so weeks, Apple has made an estimated $9,000 from Apple Pay transactions from just one retailer alone. When you consider how many more retailers are supporting Apple Pay and the fact that Apple Pay activated more than 1 million credit cards after just one week of launching, you can see that this has the potential to be another major cash cow for the company.More from BGR: This is the real reason you won’t be able to use Apple Pay in Walmart storesThis article was originally published on BGR.com
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/12/04/pantone-picks-marsala-as-top-color-of-the-new-year/21002697/	Pantone picks Marsala as top color of the new year	NEW YORK (AP) - Let's hear it for Marsala, the wine-influenced, red-kissed color of 2015, as chosen by Pantone."Hardy, robust, satisfying, fulfilling. At the same time there's a certain glamour that's attached to this color," offered Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the Pantone Color Institute.Pantone's yearly picks can herald a marked presence of a color in fashion, beauty, housewares, home and industrial design and consumer packaging, though some years the influence is stronger than others.The 2014 color of the year from the forecasters and industry consultants was Radiant Orchid, a deep tropical purple. The year before that it was Emerald green. Tangerine Tango had legs in 2012.The idea, Eiseman explained in a recent interview, is not to choose a color that will necessarily "overtake the world." In Marsala's case, she said, the shade is complex but grounding - brown-red with blue undertones for a dark blush effect.Eiseman and her team travel the world to observe color at play. For Marsala, they see an accent wall in a living room or office, a swipe of eye shadow mixed with bronze for a metallic look, a throw pillow, the exterior of a car or a bit of jewelry evoking the 1950s.There's a natural earthiness to the shade, announced Thursday, a full-bodiness like the cooking wine it is named for, without overpowering."It really does embody a certain amount of confidence and stability," Eiseman said.The hue isn't a risky one, whether in a nail polish, a frock on a runway or a pattern of stripes in a men's tie or florals for table placemats or bedding.Eiseman noted the versatile shade was among colors Pantone flagged as spring/summer trends for 2015 earlier this year, as evidenced on the runways of Herve Leger by Max Azria, Dennis Basso and Creatures of the Wind, among other designers.As they did with Radiant Orchid, the cosmetics giant Sephora plans a limited-edition collection of beauty products based on Pantone and its latest pick, Eiseman said. Marsala has been widely used in lipstick and hair color for years.One of the color's strengths, she said, is the ease in combining it with gray, black, beige and other neutrals."It's a color that you can mix with what you already own," Eiseman said. "You can add just a touch of it. That's the intent and purpose. It is not the color that swallows the world."Also on AOL:

A grand jury last week declined to indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson in the Aug. 9 shooting death of unarmed black teen Michael Brown.Following the grand jury announcement, nights of unrest followed in Ferguson, with violent protests erupting and at least 17 stores vandalized and burned to the ground.Natalie DuBose’s bake shop, “Natalie’s Cakes and More,” was broken into and looted."I didn’t have the extra savings or extra money to replace everything that was destroyed,” she told ABC News following the vandalism. “The threat of not being able to take care of your children makes you feel like less than a human being.”DuBose’s story caught Andrews’ attention. He was watching the news at home 40 miles away.“I can’t even imagine a governor that would leave a woman like this and her business to burn, like they did,” Andrews said. “But I value this woman as much as anything I’ve ever seen in my life.”So Andrews came to Ferguson and put out a call online for more volunteers such as himself. The Oath Keepers’ presence hasn’t been met by full support, Andrews said.“They were calling us the KKK, they were calling us the police. We were saying ‘We’re not the police, we’re here to defend you. We’re here to defend your rights,’” Andrews told ABC News.While the unrest in Ferguson has dissipated since last week, Andrews and his fellow volunteers say they will continue to protect the bake shop, as well as the nearby dentist’s office. Marilyn Crider, who manages Ferguson Dental, is thankful for the support.“I don’t know where they came from, but I have to thank God they showed up,” Crider said. “We wouldn’t be standing here working today. We wouldn’t have a building.”What separates the Oath Keepers from other militia groups is that they recruit men and women of the military and law enforcement – vowing to disobey “unconstitutional orders” from what the group sees as an increasingly tyrannical president and government.Many, including the police, have concerns with the Oath Keepers and their mission. Oren Segal, director of the Anti-Defamation League Center on Extremism, called the Oath keepers an “extremist, anti-government group.”“Everything that they say that stand for is based on this notion that the world and the government is going to become a dictatorship to try to prevent Americans from having their freedoms,” Segal said.Ferguson is not the first time the Oath Keepers have made headlines. This past spring, after federal agents clashed with members of a Nevada cattle ranching family over the removal of a herd from federally-managed land, Oath Keepers and like-minded followers descended on the ranch to show their support.Critics such as Segal have concerns with the group’s structure and viewpoints.“When you believe that you have to arm yourself in order to protect the people from the government, and you’re such a loosely-organized group that anybody can join you, that’s a combination that can potentially create violent incidents in the future,” Segal said.St. Louis County Police declined an interview with ABC News, but confirmed that it is investigating whether the Oath Keepers are breaking the law by providing security without a license.But Andrews says the Oath Keepers plan to stay in Ferguson for the time being. He said hundreds of volunteers – of all races – have passed through the St. Louis suburb in recent weeks. But many of them wish to remain anonymous, preferring not to show their faces.“We will be here just as long as it takes,” he told ABC News. “That is just the way it is.”
http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2015/08/20/the_pope_s_lesson_if_you_re_not_willing_to_work_you_should_not_eat	The Pope's Lesson: If You're Not Willing to Work, You Should Not Eat - The Rush Limbaugh Show	BEGIN TRANSCRIPTRUSH:  Okay.  Who do you think said this:  "Whoever will not work should not eat."  Who said that?  Well, a lot of people said that.  In this case it was Il Papa, Pope Francis said this.  This guy's all over the ballpark.  You never know what he's gonna say one day to the next.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH:  Okay.  So who said it first?  "Whoever will not work should not eat?"  Somebody did say it first.  Snerdley, you are on a roll today.  "It is in the Bible 'somewhere,'" quote, unquote.  St. Paul said it to the Thessalonians, and it is not, "Whoever will not work will not eat." It was, "Whoever will not work should not eat."  Of course, here in the United States we have 94 million not working, and they are all eating.  By the way, folks, I don't have a problem with that per se. Don't misunderstand what I'm saying here.  You people... You know, I get e-mails every time I make that claim. I get these snarky e-mails from people who think, "You really think people should starve, Mr. Limbaugh? Is that your...?" Come on. You people know better than that, you little nattering nabobs.  The fact of the matter is, 94 million Americans are not working and they're all eating. It means they don't have to work, and that's not good for them, and it's not good for us.It's not good for the country, it's not good for the future, it's not good for their families, it's not good for their self-esteem.  It's what everybody was talking about when they were reacting to James Harrison saying that his boys are not gonna get participation trophies.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Speaking of which, you knew it was coming.  There's an op-ed in USA Today (I have it here in the Stack) from somebody who thinks that James Harrison is all wet.That that's just all wrong, that there's nothing at all wrong with kids getting performance trophies, 'cause kids are smarter than we know.  They know.  They're smart.  They know who wins; they know who's losing.  They don't need this kind of education.  They're fully capable of understanding they're getting trophies for nothing, and it doesn't hurt 'em.  Anyway, "In his weekly Angelus message Wednesday, Pope Francis praised the value of hard work and a willingness to do one's part for the common good rather than freeloading off society. "Citing Saint Paul, Francis said that 'anyone unwilling to work should not eat' and added that being called a hard worker is the highest form of praise for a 'serious, honest person.'"  Now, quite understandably, the left is gonna have problems with this, given that the cited source is the Bible.  'Cause that's for religious fanatics and pro-lifers and Southerners, and therefore it's kookery. It's quackery. "To call someone a worker, the Pope said, means that he is a member of the community who does his part and doesn't 'live off others.'"  This lesson has been taught so many times in the course of human history, it's amazing that it never is learned.  If it were learned, the Democrat Party wouldn't be nearly the success that it is.  But even though it's understood, even though philosophically people say, "Oh, yeah, yeah. Everybody should work. Oh, yeah, everybody should participate. Oh, yeah, everybody needs to contribute. Oh, there's universal agreement with that!"And then it all down and falls apart.  When you've got 94 million Americans not working, many of whom want to -- a slew of them want to. But 94 million Americans are not working but they're all eating.  And let's not just stop there.  They probably all have transportation.  Many of them, we know, have air-conditioning.  Many of them have big-screen or some kind of TV.  Many of them have cable. (interruption) Obama phones, yeah. A lot of Obama phones out there.  Many of them may now be cord cutters.  You know, there is a...Speaking of cord cutting, there is a serious and dramatic cultural shift taking place in the American pop culture, and it is this.  The numbers of people who are abandoning traditional sources for television is rapidly increasing.  Pretty soon, it's gonna change the face of entertainment, the way content is delivered.  Cable TV subscriptions are down; satellite subscriptions are down.  In some cases, it's at a pretty rapid clip, and people are more and more content oriented.So they don't even know or care, for example, what network the shows they like are on.  They just want the shows, wherever they have to go to get the shows. Among the Millennials, it stands to reason. They don't want to pay for it.  Somebody offers this stuff for nothing and they are there, even piracy.  As you know, I study the tech blogs.  I don't just read them; I study them.  There is an abject hatred for cable companies.  There's an abject hatred for telecoms. Now, the tech blogs are a bunch of leftists. They're a bunch of high-tech nerd geek leftists.  It's understandable they'd be anti-corporate, but it's really pronounced, and it's almost universal.  And whenever there is a story of a cable company here or a cable company or telecom over there getting punished, losing customers, losing money, they are happy. They love it.  There is a resentment along with the hatred, and I think it's like many things are. It's rooted in money and the fact that these people just...They're not making much.  They're not earning very much money.  It's the Obama economy, after all.  And they just are on a quest to find as much as they can for nothing.  It's the same concept, though, as eating.  I mean, there's no free lunch.  Somebody's paying for it.  You know, if you're assessing cable TV, satellite TV, or whatever, and you're not paying for it because you don't think you should have to, somebody is.  The idea that you can continue to get it if you don't pay for it and nobody pays for it?How can it survive?  But people who look at the federal government as never ending no matter what happens to it, people who believe in big government, they have this belief that the golden goose never dies.  "The golden goose, the producers, they're always gonna be there.  They're never gonna go away. They're never gonna have any real harm come to them. Don't let them fool you."  This is what they believe.  But this shift in television content particularly... It's not just Netflix, although Netflix is big.You have Amazon and Roku and all these things. It's getting significant now, and there's always massive change in every culture, every generation, every society. But there are so many systems in place, deeply embedded in terms of the operational structure that this change is profound. It's gonna catch a lot of these corporate entities flat-footed.  ESPN! ESPN is in some serious... They're not in serious financial trouble, but ESPN is probably the richest cable company because they are paid the most per subscriber by cable companies. ESPN was just rolling in money.  They were printing it.  Can you imagine number of people who subscribe to cable and imagine every one of those people paying ESPN $5 a month through the cable company?  The cable company gets it, but when you pay the cable company, you're paying ESPN that much even though your bill goes to the cable company.  All of that is dependent on the number of subscribers, and if the cable companies/satellite companies start losing subscribers, so do all of these networks and content providers. And it is going to change the way content's produced and provided, paid for, delivered. I mean, it's exciting in one sense.  And where it looks like it's heading is an a la carte way down the road, meaning you turn on your TV and you'll be able to tell Siri, "I want to watch Cheers," and you're given a list of episodes, and you pick the one you want to watch.  You haven't accessed a network.  You don't know that it's NBC.  You don't know that it's CBS.  It may not be either one. You're just going someplace that you're paying for that has this content. You tell Siri you want to watch this, and there it is on the screen. You choose the episode you want to watch, hit the "play" button, and you're off.  This is the dream and has been the dream for a lot of people.  At the root of this is the tiered structure of the cable bills, people being forced to pay for 250 channels when they watch five.  Therein lies some of the resentment and where this robust change is taking place. To me, it's fascinating to watch.  I'm a content believer.  Content, content, content.  I've always... You know, people say to me and have been saying to me more than 28 years, "Rush, are you worried what's gonna happen to AM radio?"  Nothing as long as I'm on it.  "Well, that's really a braggadocios."  No, no, no, no.  I'm speaking of pure business.  I believe in content, content, content.  People like what they like; they'll go wherever it is to get it, even if it's a couple of tin cans and a piece of string. That's why I've always believed in content as the way to cut through all the noise.  You know, so much to choose from.  Radio, television, online, you name it.  It's where the customer's loyalty lies. Viewers, listeners, where does the loyalty lie? To the network that broadcasts it or to the content itself?  It's obviously to the content.  I think there's lessons there for people in politics.  Is it loyalty to a party or to a particular candidate in the party? How far does it go?The Republicans have learned that party loyalty can't be counted on.  They learned it in 2012 when four million people stayed home, according to the statistics.  But, you know, content to me has always been king, and it's not to many people.  There are other factors that are just as important.  I don't think there's any question now that content, content, content is always going to be the concerning factor in whether something's popular or not.  I don't know how it can be otherwise. There are rare exceptions, loss leader-type programming.  But, as I say, that's not a profit center anyway. So it's not included in the equation.  Now, back to Il Papa.  Pope Francis is all over the place.  One day he sounds like a standard, ordinary, right-down-the-middle conservative.  The next day, you would swear the guy's got ties to the deepest socialism in the world.  Here he is standing up for work and talking about the value of work, and the value of work to a person's psyche, not just to the community. And I don't hear this much.  You hear it in the context of jobs. "We need to provide jobs this, jobs that." But actual work and the self-worth that comes from a job well done?  You know, these people that proselytize on self-esteem could learn a lot about the kind of self-esteem that results from doing good work, doing great work -- and not work acknowledged by others that's great.  You know whether you've done a good job or not. The pope said that work is "'is needed to support one's family, raise children and ensure a decent life to loved ones.' This habit of hard work, he added, is learned in the home, from one's parents who support their family and in this way contribute to the common good.  Christians can find a great example of industriousness in the life of Jesus himself, Francis said. In the Gospel, 'the Holy Family of Nazareth appears as a working family, and Jesus himself is called a "carpenter's son" or even "the carpenter."' "Saint Paul's injunction that people who don't want to work shouldn't eat is a 'good recipe for losing weight,' he quipped." A little stab of humor there. "Paul's denunciation of idleness, Francis continued, 'refers explicitly to a false spiritualism of some who lived off the backs of their brothers and sisters while 'doing nothing.'' In the Christian outlook, a commitment of hard work is not opposed to a deep spiritual life, Francis said, referencing the example of Saint Benedict who taught that 'prayer and work can and should be found together in harmony.' "'A lack of work is bad for the spirit,' the Pope said...  Work, he said, 'expresses the dignity of being created in the image of God. That is why it is said that work is sacred.'" Okay.  Next time you run into a homeless guy (the odds of that are good in New York City near the United Nations), make sure you encounter this homeless person with a liberal buddy.  Encounter the homeless person, stand there, study the situation, and say, "Boy, man, this guy just needs to get a job," and watch what happens to you. Gauge the reaction from your liberal buddy.  He will react to your expressed desire -- the homeless person get a job and start working -- with disdain and will say something like, "Oh, easy for you to say!" as though it's discriminatory and bigoted to suggest that there are routes out of idleness that one can take themselves without the any assistance.  That's why the pope... I mean, this is as down-the-middle...Call it, "conservative," but this is just plain, good old-fashioned common sense.  But it isn't at all compatible with socialism.  Because socialism is created around the common denominator of sameness and failure and accommodating it and treating it and being nice to it and being understanding of it.  Some days, the pope gives off that impression.  This day he didn't.  
http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/controversial-penalty-call-could-result-in-rules-change-in-2015-051341620.html	Controversial penalty call could result in rules change in 2015	Midway through the third quarter, his team leading 14-13, San Diego Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers lofted a pass to Ladarius Green. The New England Patriots' Brandon Browner hit Green hard – hard enough to pop Green's head back (and, the team later revealed, give him a concussion) – and the ball popped up into the air. New England's Devin McCourty snagged it and ran it back for what appeared to be a go-ahead touchdown.Not so fast. Refs threw a flag on the play, and the result might be a rules change in 2015.The referees contended that Browner had gone helmet-to-helmet on Green, and in the lightning-quick environment of real life, it certainly appeared that way. The flag wiped six New England points off the board and resulted in a 15-yard unnecessary roughness penalty.It was a potential game-changing play ... and it was a completely wrong call.As the game progressed, it turned out the penalty wasn't a decisive one; New England would go on to score 10 more unanswered points and win going away. But replays demonstrated that Browner did indeed lead with his shoulder rather than his head. He did everything right, and still got nailed for the penalty.As a result of increased concussion awareness, the penalty for a helmet-to-helmet hit is so severe that defensive players have taken to hitting lower on the body to avoid any possibility of a penalty. That, in turn, has led to a greater risk of knee injuries. No good deed goes unpunished.However, the rule change that this play could enact has to do with the replay aspect. The helmet-to-helmet play is not reviewable, despite the fact that many, including Patriots coach Bill Belichick, have lobbied for change. A simple review would have shown Browner's intention and split-second correct decision-making.A review of helmet-to-helmet hits is an easy enough rule to implement for the 2015 season. And if it cuts down on confusion about how players are making tackles, so much the better.____ Jay Busbee is a writer for Yahoo Sports.

http://www.voanews.com/content/farming-with-salty-water-is-possible/2510044.html	Dutch Experiment Shows Farming With Salty Water Possible	One of the many adverse effects of global climate change is the rise of sea levels, which scientists say can increase the salinity level of fresh water reserves. As saline water cannot be used for irrigation, farm fields close to the seashore are lost to agriculture. But a farm in Netherlands has managed to grow healthy and tasty vegetables in soil irrigated with salt water.Salinization is reducing the world’s irrigated lands by 1 to 2 percent annually, according to the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization.But that doesn't faze Dutch farmer Marc Van Rijsselberghe, who has used saline water to kill some plants in order to identify which ones are able to thrive.“We put a lot of plants in the field and then we put them in fresh water and in sea water and all varieties between it, and then we see which variety is surviving and which variety is dying,” he said.Working with scientists from the Free University of Amsterdam, Van Rijsselberghe and his team divided a farm into eight plots covered with a network of irrigation pipes.Separate pipes bring fresh water and sea water to a distribution center where a computer-controlled system mixes irrigation water with eight different degrees of salinity.“And then computer says 'go' and then it goes to the fields and dripping irrigation starts to work and we are going to kill plants. That's it,” said Van Rijsselberghe.Numerous sensors continuously control soil salinity and moisture. Van Rijsselberghe said they were able to harvest vegetables from most of the test plots. Although they were smaller than normal, he said they contain more sugar and salt, so they taste better.“It's a miracle. It shouldn't be a carrot, it should be dying if we look at the data that are available in the world at the moment,” he said.The farm managed to grow carrots, cabbage, onions and beetroot, but potatoes proved to be the most tolerant to saline water. Van Rijsselberghe said four varieties of salt-tolerant potatoes recently were shipped to Pakistan where thousands of hectares of land damaged by salinization are being prepared for testing the Dutch potatoes.

http://www.wired.com/2015/08/nasas-logo-70s-ridiculously-cool/	NASA’s Logo From The ’70s Was Ridiculously Cool	Tokyo has a logo for its 2020 Olympic games, and what a confusing one it is.The flat symbol, unveiled by the Tokyo 2020 Organizing Committee, comprises four geometric shapes—a red circle, a black rectangle, and gold and silver triangles, each with a concave hypotenuse—forming a “T,” and “L,” and an “r.” We can assume that “T” stands for Tokyo, and that the red circle is a reference to Japan’s rising sun, also pictured on the country’s flag. The significance and symbolism behind the rest of the imagery prove baffling.The insignia is by Kenjiro Sano, whose design résumé includes local packaging and product designs, and it’s radically different from the frenetic, zany, and script-like logos we’ve seen for recent Olympic games in Rio de Janeiro, London, and Beijing. Instead, Sano’s buttoned-up logo is a throwback to logos from the 1960s and 1970s, like the simple gold-and-red icon for the Tokyo games in 1964, and the rising sun and snowflake combo used for the Sapporo games in 1972.Japanese designers are renowned for elegant, efficient, minimalism. Consider Muji’s restrained approach to homewares, Uniqlo’s consistently pared down fashions, and the simple ingenuity of Shigeru Ban’s architecture. Unlike Japan’s other design exports, Sano’s logo for Tokyo is less but not more.

http://www.inquisitr.com/1657624/halle-berry-to-gabriel-aubry-proof-hair-bleaching-straightening-lightening-hair-nahla/	Halle Berry To Gabriel Aubry: ‘Proof You’re Bleaching Nahla’s Hair!’ ‘She’s Crazy,’ Fans Say	Halle Berry is acting up again. This time the battle with ex Gabriel Aubry is over Nahla’s natural hair. TMZ reported earlier that Berry was back in court because she believes that model Gabriel Aubry bleached and used chemical straighteners in their daughter Nahla’s hair to make her appear more white, according to Just Jared. Now, the actress claims that she has the proof.According to court records, Halle is also concerned that the chemicals could potentially damage the young child’s hair. A judge ruled last week that both Halle Berry and Gabriel Aubry should leave Nahla’s hair alone. Gabriel Aubry has denied using any type of chemical in the girl’s hair, stating that the bleaching happened naturally from being out in the sun, and that her hair was straightened with a blow out technique, using a hair dryer.But records submitted to court recently contain a statement from Microtrace lab, where they say the hairs extracted from Nahla’s hair brush have undergone chemical treatment. The lab also reported “extensive” damage to the hair.With the slew of news article about Halle Berry in the media lately, and her ongoing public fights with Gabriel in court, fans have stamped Berry with the “crazy” label.For the past several years, since the birth of her child, fans have noticed a continuous change in Halle’s personality from a once vibrant, happy, smiling, and beautiful actress to a bitter middle-aged actress who wears a constant look of disdain on her face, mixed with a bit of sadness at times.Some attribute the stress of family life at her age to her emotional state. Mostly white fans are critical of Berry’s stance that Nahla is black and should not be made to look white, arguing that the child is most likely 75 percent white since Halle herself is biracial.Some of the other grumblings about the Dorothy Dandridge actress read this way.“Are you kidding me? What is wrong with this woman?” “She is a mentally disturbed. There is a reason no man will stay with her for any amount of time. She should spend more time with her psychiatrist than her attorneys. By all accounts Gabriel Aubrey is a wonderful father and the only stable parent in the child’s life.” “This confirms she’s a nut job.” “Halle ‘s Mom is white. Gabriel is white. Sorry Halle, but Nala has white in her.”African-American fans say that it is Halle’s right to choose what is best for her daughter’s hair, and that if Halle wants her child’s hair to be free of chemicals and sport her natural hair, so be it.“1st off any chemicals in a childs hair especially at that age is damaging…. Just like a perm or color….too much damage will prevent the hair from growing permanently.. “Seriously she’s too young.” “I agree with Halle. I’m a hairdresser and its way to young to process the hair. Black or white.”And the rest are sick and tired of race being brought into every single conversation in the news media. The Inquisitr reported in October that Halle Berry tried to have child support payments to Aubry drastically reduced. The former couple, who separated in 2010, have been battling over child custody and child issues ever since.
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/07/texas-voter-id_n_6117742.html?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000592	Texans Slam Voter ID Law: 'Now That It's Happened To Me, I'm Devastated'	Betty Thorn, an 84-year-old grandmother who lives in an assisted-living facility in Austin, Texas, has voted in every major election in her life since she became eligible. But Thorn didn't vote this year, her granddaughter says. Thanks to Texas's new voter ID law, considered one of the strictest in the country, she couldn't get the right identification.Amy Gautreaux, Thorn's granddaughter, told The Huffington Post that Thorn's driver's license had lapsed because she doesn't drive anymore. Gautreaux found time a few days before the election to take Thorn to the driver’s license office to get a regular ID, but her proof-of-address documents weren’t sufficient. The two asked for an election identification certificate, but Thorn didn't have her birth certificate, so she couldn't get that either. (The Austin North Lamar driver's license office could not be reached for comment.)“When the voter ID law was announced, I didn't understand the big deal. I figured most people have ID,” Gautreaux said. “Now that it's happened to me, I'm devastated. This is what happened to an elderly person who has family to help her. I can only imagine how many don't have any help.”Thorn is one of the hundreds of thousands of Texans whom Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg predicted might have trouble voting after the Supreme Court ruled that Texas could implement a restrictive voter ID law in this year’s midterm elections. The law has strict identification requirements, allowing concealed carry permits and election identification certificates to serve as voting documents, but not out-of-state or student IDs. The Supreme Court didn’t rule on whether the law was constitutional, a question that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is now expected to take up.Whether or not the Texas law is allowed to stand could have major ramifications for voters in the rest of the United States. The Justice Department is challenging the law under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, a provision that prohibits governments from passing laws that discriminate against minorities. This is a section that survived after the Supreme Court gutted the law last year. But the Texas case will test how strong this provision is, and could determine how it will be applied to voting laws in other states in the future.In this week's election, Texas served as a case study for what happens when a state passes voter ID laws without federal permission. In some cases, the law deterred people from going to vote at all.Brenda Lauw, a 62-year-old great-grandmother and former teacher, has spent almost two decades in Texas, including a 14-year stretch from 1978 to 1992. In the late '70s, she worked on the campaign of famous Texan George H.W. Bush, who was then running for the Republican presidential nomination. But this year, Lauw didn't vote.Lauw moved back to Texas in 2008 from Louisiana, hoping that her 30 years of experience teaching art and special education would help her find a job. But thanks in part to the financial crisis and subsequent recession, schools weren’t hiring. She did find a job at a school, but was later laid off and worked at a call center. She decided to move into an RV to save money. She now lives in her RV in Crystal Beach, Texas, which she said is “cool as heck” because she doesn’t have to rely on government housing. But it makes proving her residency difficult.Though she's now based in Texas, Lauw still has a Louisiana driver’s license. She has tried to get one from Texas, but all the documentation she provided to The Huffington Post -- including her teaching certificate and her honorable military discharge from her time in the Army -- is under her married name. Lauw, who is divorced, has her birth certificate but not her marriage and divorce certificates or two proofs-of-residency, all of which she needs in order to get a Texas driver’s license.Lauw didn’t bother trying to register or get an election identification certificate for this election, because she was discouraged by the new law and she thought she wouldn't meet the requirements. She was partially right: While a proof of residence isn’t needed for the voting card, Lauw would have needed to show a marriage or divorce certificate."Isn't that a part of being disenfranchised? Laws so complicated that a college grad can't figure them out," she said. "I shouldn't have to hunt for a 40-year-old document."Madeleine Pearsall, 61, also ran into trouble with the new law. She moved to Austin, Texas when she was just five weeks old. “I never put my feet down anywhere but Austin,” she told The Huffington Post. She’s a Democrat, but keeps a framed picture of former President Richard Nixon on her wall because he signed the 26th Amendment as a witness after it was ratified by the states, giving her the right to vote the year she turned 18.Last month, when Pearsall first tried to vote early, she learned she was unable to do so. She was on a payment plan to pay off parking tickets, and her license had been expired for too long, rendering it unfit under Texas’ new law.“Driving is a privilege, but voting is a right,” she said. “I’ve always been so proud to vote, because I have friends who went to Vietnam and didn’t come back, and they couldn’t vote.”Last Friday, Pearsall went to a driver’s license office on South Interstate 35 to get an election identification certificate. She was told she couldn’t get one because she didn’t have the right documentation, she said. When she realized she might not be able to vote this year, she raised a fuss. “I didn’t cuss, but I’m loud,” she told HuffPost.Officers were called to address the disturbance, the Austin Police Department confirmed. It turned out that Pearsall did still qualify for a regular Texas identification card, which cost money. Pearsall said a trooper offered to help pay for it. The cops “got it," she said, "how wrong this was."Tom Vinger, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, confirmed that a “trooper kindly offered the patron a few dollars,” which she ended up not needing because she qualified for the senior $6 rate. So Pearsall got her ID.But many others were probably not so lucky. Prior to Tuesday's election, critics of the law estimated that up to 750,000 people in Texas wouldn’t have sufficient ID and would need to get an election certificate to vote. Yet between June 2013 and the week leading up to Tuesday's midterms, only 371 certificates had been issued, the Houston Chronicle reported.“The new voter ID laws are ridiculous,” said Lauw, who said she has been politically active her whole life. Though she once served as vice president of a local Republican women’s club, she now considers herself a liberal.“Back then, I really was a Republican," Lauw told HuffPost. "But they weren’t like they are now.”

According to Mail Online, the former couple kept the holiday as normal as possible, likely to ensure that their kids were able to be with both of their parents. While Carey and Cannon might not be getting back together, they both seem to be on the same page when it comes to raising their children, and being together as a family when they should be.“Gotta keep that going. I want to make sure we have a wonderful holiday together. Somewhere cold and snowy, like Aspen [Colorado],” Nick recently said about spending Christmas with Mariah and the twins. “Everything I do is for [my kids]. I just want to be the best father I can possibly be.”Carey and Cannon spent Thanksgiving at Cannon’s home. According to Rolling Out, the couple has not been spending time with Moroccan and Monroe as a couple, but were able to put their differences aside for the holiday. After their family dinner, however, Mariah left Nick’s place, and checked into a hotel. This strongly suggests that the two don’t have any plans of getting back together. It is clear that everything they are doing now is meant to keep their children happy, and a part of the loving environment that they deserve.As previously reported by the Inquisitr, Nick and Mariah have not said too much about their split. They have confirmed that they are no longer together, but neither one has bad-mouthed the other. Cannon has been a bit more candid about his current marital status, but he says that he’s kept it classy.“Being a public figure, of course you don’t ever want to deal with your personal life in the public, but I’m the type of dude I deal with everything head-on. I’m not a hider, I never hold punches, hold my tongue. I’m as candid as I can possibly be, but I try and be as respectful, as classy and the best human being I possibly can be.”Carey and Cannon’s Thanksgiving was quiet, but many were thrilled to see the two together again with their 3-year-old twins. Going through a divorce is never easy, but when two people are able to see the big picture, and remember that the most important thing is their children, it’s quite refreshing.Do you think Nick and Mariah are doing the right thing by spending the holidays together as a family even though their marriage is over?[Photo courtesy of Disney Parks]

Dillashaw (9-2, 5-2) in the main event at Las Vegas' MGM Grand Garden Arena.The Barao-Dillashaw bout replaces the original main event between Weidman, the middleweight title holder, and former light heavyweight champ Lyoto Machida. That bout has been pushed back to UFC 175 on July 5 due to Weidman's injury.The Barao-Dillashaw title fight headlines the evening's five-bout pay-per-view main card, which follows preliminary bouts on FOX Sports 1 and UFC Fight Pass.Barao looks to defend the undisputed bantamweight title for a second time. The Brazilian, 27, who boasts an amazing 32-fight unbeaten streak, claimed the promotion's interim title in 2012 when then-champ Dominick Cruz was forced to the sidelines.He defended the temporary title twice before Cruz's extended layoff forced the promotion to grant Barao full championship status. Barao answered in style, downing Dillashaw's teammate, Urijah Faber, in the first round at February's UFC 169, giving the champ his first defense of the undisputed title.TORN ACL: Georges St-Pierre will undergo surgery for injuryMeanwhile, Dillashaw fought most recently in January, earning a convincing decision win against Mike Easton. A finalist on The Ultimate Fighter 14, Dillashaw, 28, fell short in his bid for the season's tournament win in a TKO loss to John Dodson.Since that defeat, however, Dillashaw has gone 5-1 in six UFC contests. The loss came in a contentious split decision to Raphael Assuncao in a hard-fought October 2013 matchup.EPIC BATTLES: The hidden costs and benefitsBarao told MMAjunkie this week that he expected Assuncao to be named as his next challenger.

Andy has long been on the other side of the hot seat so we decided to turn the tables on him and have him grilled by his best friend, Graciela Meltzer. And no question was off limits!Andy is the mastermind behind the wildly popular Real Housewives franchise and he admits, "what goes on behind the scenes is as dramatic as what goes on in front of the camera."WATCH: Andy Cohen Weighs In On How Jail Will Affect Joe & Teresa GiudiceThe first version, The Real Housewives of Orange County, premiered in 2006. Since then, the franchise has had its fair share of tragic story lines, from lawsuits, divorces, custody battles and suicide, that have continued long after the cameras stopped rolling.When asked whether he feels partly responsible for the drama, including Teresa Giudice's recent sentence to 15-months in jail for fraud charges, Andy told ET, "I don't.""I think what we're seeing is a reflection of life," he says. "The Housewives is a voluntary show, no one is forced to be on the Housewives."The 46-year-old is enjoying the single life in NYC and is very candid about dating in the world of social media and online dating apps.WATCH: Which Celebs Have Joined the Dating Crazy Tinder?"I went on Tinder this year, and I write a lot about that [in the book]," he says. "It's amusing and fascinating and scientific and weird, and I love a good dating story, and I have plenty in the book."But Andy says he's very patient when it comes to finding Mr. Right. He tells ET, "I need a man, I need some love, but until I find the right guy, I'm having a pretty great time."Andy's famous for playing games with guests such as "Plead The Fifth," on his hit Bravo series, Watch What Happens Live but here's what happens when Grace played the games on him! Andy left no stone unturned and some of his answers may surprise you.Which celeb does he still get starstruck by? Madonna: "I was on an airplane with her. She comes to a party that I had, but I'm still totally gobsmacked by her and completely starstruck." He later added, "I think [16-year-old Andy Cohen's] braces would come flying off if he knew that someday he would have met Madonna."Most uncomfortable guest on 'Watch What Happens Live?' "Maybe Scott Baio because he didn't seem like he was having fun."
http://nesn.com/2014/10/bill-belichick-patriots-havent-decided-to-make-roster-moves-before-thursday/	Bill Belichick: Patriots Haven't Decided To Make Roster Moves Before Thursday	FOXBORO, Mass. — The New England Patriots might wait until after Thursday night’s game against the New York Jets to place linebacker Jerod Mayo and running back Stevan Ridley on injured reserve.The Patriots have a short week, with just one day of regular practice, so there likely isn’t enough time to get a new player acclimated to the system before facing the Jets.“I think that’s something that we’re just going to have to evaluate here in the next day or two,” Belichick said Tuesday on a conference call about making a roster move. “I’ve talked with (Patriots director of player personnel) Nick Caserio and our coaching staff and Nick’s staff and we’ll just have to try to figure it all out here.“Like you said, it’s a real short week. So, we’ll just have to take all those things into consideration and try to figure out what we’re going to do — if we would make one and who it would be and so forth. We haven’t decided that yet. We’ll see how it goes here.”The Patriots worked out five linebackers on Monday, but according to multiple sources, the Patriots are waiting until Friday to add anyone from outside the organization. The Patriots could look to sign a player from the practice squad as late as Wednesday, however.“Look, we tell the practice squad, all those players every week, that they’re one sprained ankle or one day away from being active,” Belichick said when asked if the Patriots could promote running back Jonas Gray. “We’ve made those moves as late as the day before the game — Saturdays on a Sunday game and things like that. Those players prepare every week to be ready to play both on offense or defense and in the kicking game. As you know, we’ve done that before. That’s the same for them every week. There’s no difference for them this week or from any other week. They’re on the roster, on the practice squad, they’re potentially on the roster for the game. So, they prepare for the game as if they are on the roster. If that happens, it happens. If it doesn’t, then we go to next week.”Gray and linebacker Darius Fleming are the obvious choices to sign off the practice squad, but the Patriots also could elect to roll with who they already have on their 53-man roster Thursday night. Rookie James White has been inactive in five of six games this season, so he likely will see an increase in reps this week with Ridley out. The Patriots’ depth at linebacker depends on whether Dont’a Hightower, who has missed two straight games, can play.
http://www.newser.com/story/211623/inside-the-insanely-tricky-process-of-breeding-pandas.html	Inside the Insanely Tricky Process of Breeding Pandas	(Newser) – Congratulations are in order for the National Zoo's female giant panda—or so veterinarians hope based on an ultrasound yesterday: Mei Xiang is presumably pregnant. Experts are cautious as the 1.5-inch-long fetus could still be reabsorbed or the panda could miscarry. Research vet Pierre Comizzoli says the ultrasound may even have detected bamboo fiber. But a baby for Mei Xiang, who's given birth to just two healthy cubs in the last decade, would be big news, reports Smithsonian. As researchers have been detailing over months using #PandaStory, the artificial insemination of a giant panda is incredibly difficult and frustrating. Female giant pandas have just 36 hours per year to be impregnated. Should a pregnancy occur, a panda embryo stalls its development for three to five months so it can be delivered at the ideal time, a process known as embryonic dispausal or delayed implantation.Afterward, it spends 45 to 50 days in the womb. During that time, experts usually identify a pregnancy by a spike in the mother's progesterone levels. Vets confirmed earlier this month that Mei Xiang—artificially inseminated in April with fresh and frozen semen, reports Phys.org—has high levels. "So she's going to start to build a nest and she's going to start to stay in her den for longer periods of time," says Comizzoli. But pandas also have phantom pregnancies—Mei Xiang has had six—meaning when progesterone levels decrease, indicating a baby should be born within days, no cub appears. Ultrasounds, if pandas allow them, are also unreliable because cubs are so small—less than a pound—at birth. The ultrasound yesterday has experts crossing their fingers. The zoo says Mei Xiang "could give birth early next week, or possibly in early September," per NBC News. (One crafty panda faked a pregnancy for extra food.)
http://www.voanews.com/content/john-kerry-irans-zarif-in-vienne-for-nuclear-talks/2484277.html	US: Nuclear Talks With Iranian FM Zarif 'Very Concrete'	U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif met Wednesday in Vienna for talks on international efforts to limit Iran’s nuclear program.Kerry and Zarif were joined by European Union representative Catherine Ashton, who has been leading efforts by Germany, Russia, Britain, France, China and the United States to convince Iran to roll back its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of some economic sanctions.   After more than six hours of talks, a senior State Department official said they are “deliberately working through the technical issues” in “very intense, very focused, very concrete” efforts to reach an agreement by next month’s deadline.   “We have not discussed an extension because we believe in keeping the pressure on,” the official said, but we “know enough about negotiations to never say never.”   In a televised address late Monday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said a settlement “can be achieved” in the next five weeks.   “Step by step,” Secretary Kerry said at the start of Wednesday’s talks.   Among the significant gaps that remain are questions of how much uranium Iran will be allowed to enrich to what level of purity. That would determine how long it would take Iran to develop a nuclear weapon should it decide to do so.A senior U.S. diplomat says Iran and six world powers still aim to meet a self-imposed Nov. 24 deadline to end a decade-old nuclear standoff, although both Tehran and Moscow have indicated that more time may be required.Iran has long said its nuclear program is for peaceful civilian purposes, and it does not intend to build atomic weapons. U.S. and European leaders believe Tehran has engaged in a covert program, however, to build such devices.   The senior State Department official said, “What these negotiations are about is whether Iran is willing to take verifiable actions to show that their program is for peaceful purposes,” and the Obama administration is hopeful that Iran will decide to take advantage of this “historic opportunity.”   Zarif and Ashton remained in Vienna for talks Thursday with political directors from the six countries negotiating this deal. It is there they are expected to decide how best to move forward in the next five weeks.

It follows three best friends -- Joaquin (Channing Tatum, left), Manolo (Diego Luna) and Maria (Zoe Saldana). "It's a romance, it's a comedy, it's full of action," says Gutierrez, who worked for 14 years to bring it to the screen. "The movie has a ton of heart."  (Photo: Twentieth Century Fox & Reel FX)The movie focuses on the journey of Manolo (Diego Luna), who woos the independent and strong-willed Maria (Zoe Saldana). Manolo comes from a family of bullfighters, but he wants to spend his life playing the guitar. "It's this magic journey about this guy who has to come to terms with who he is," says Gutierrez.  (Photo: Twentieth Century Fox & Reel FX)Tatum's Joaquin is the town hero who competes with his best friend for the hand of Maria. The film was his first opportunity to voice a major animated character. "I have never been part of an animated film like this and I've always loved them," says Tatum. "This is such an amazing story."  (Photo: Twentieth Century Fox & Reel FX)Manolo (Diego Luna) serenades Maria (Zoe Saldana), the woman with whom he has long been in love. Luna took special classes to learn how to sing specifically for the movie part. "I got this call from Diego before we began, and he said, 'Guess what? I can sing!' " says director Jorge Gutierrez. "Sure enough, he can.''  (Photo: Twentieth Century Fox & Reel FX)Tatum was very proud to have a mustachioed character on film with Joaquin. "I was fighting for an even bigger mustache. We compromised," says Tatum. "I love it in the movie. Joaquin talks about it all the time."  (Photo: Twentieth Century Fox & Reel FX)Like this topic? You may also like these photo galleries:G.I. Joe star Channing Tatum has played his share of war heroes, but never one as animated or macho as his mustachioed Joaquin in the fantastical The Book of Life.The wild, 3-D animated tale (due out Oct. 17) features a love triangle among three childhood friends, Manolo (voice by Diego Luna), Maria (Zoe Saldana) and Tatum's Joaquin, who are stirred up after the unpredictable gods wager on which man will win Maria's heart."Manolo and my character Joaquin were best friends, we were all like the Three Musketeers," says Tatum, discussing his first major animated role. "But craziness ensues as the gods wager. Things happen that people won't expect, I can guarantee that."Best to expect the unexpected in the story by director Jorge Gutierrez and producer Guillermo del Toro, as the three characters deal with their interweaving struggles.The story focuses on the romantic, strong-jawed Manolo, who has big problems besides the growing competition with his best friend. Manolo dreams of breaking away from his family's rich history of bullfighting to play the guitar, much to the dismay of his father, the world's greatest matador (Hector Elizondo) and super-macho grandfather (Danny Trejo)."Much of this is Manolo's magic journey. He has to come to terms with who he is," says Gutierrez.This journey takes him from the Land of the Living to the Land of the Remembered, where people who have lived complete lives, and are remembered among the living, go after they die. A final, daunting destination is The Land of the Forgotten, where those who have died with unfulfilled lives dwell.Along the way Manolo meets his bullfighter great-grandfather, who always wanted to be an opera singer (Placido Domingo) but never followed his dream. There are also wild characters including Candle Maker (rapper Ice Cube), an ancient god with a body of wax and a beard made of clouds."Who better than Ice Cube?" asks Gutierrez. "He turned out to be really funny."The stylized look in many scenes is inspired by a Mexican holiday dear to Gutierrez's heart: Day of the Dead (which culminates Nov. 2, shortly after the film's release). It took 14 years to get the film made after he found a receptive ear with idiosyncratic producer Del Toro."I have been pitching the story and people have been saying, 'This is cool, but you're never going to get it made,' " says Gutierrez. "To other cultures it might seem dark, but the Day of the Dead is actually a very positive thing. It's about joyfully remembering the people no longer with us."The Alabama-born Tatum learned about this world on the job."When this was pitched to me, it was like, 'How does this work? I don't know much about the holiday.' But this movie is a mirror of the director. It's hilarious and crazy."There's also heart, even in Manolo's battle with his best friend."It goes to a place of sour grapes and deep hurt to the point of losing their friendship," says Tatum. "But friendship always wins. That's the message of this story: love and friendship and what you're willing to sacrifice for these ideas."Read or Share this story: http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/05/27/book-of-life-channing-tatum-jorge-gutierrez/9304799/
http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/golf-devil-ball-golf/how-did-tiger-woods--new-but-old-swing-look-in-his-return-001927842.html	How did Tiger Woods' new-but-old swing look in his return?	Alright, Tiger Woods finished tied for last in his return to competitive golf at the Hero World Challenge.Despite that, there's plenty to like about what the 14-time major champion showed at his former home club, Isleworth, near Orlando. In particular, Woods' golf swing looked more reminiscent of the guy who won all of those majors from 1997-2008, not the swing from the last four years that let him down at times and physically hurt him at others.Start with the stance. Woods looks like he has a wider base and more weight shifted toward his right side, a better position than where he was under Sean Foley, where he was setting up to load his left side to compress the ball at impact. His posture is also a little more upright, which is key to the entire motion.The takeaway is longer, which does a couple of things for Woods. It allows him a chance to generate more power by feeling comfortable enough to take his swing to and past parallel at the top. It also buys him some time on the downswing, as well, giving the club a longer path back to the ball and more time to square the clubface. The path to the top is also more upright, leading to a higher ball flight, the ideal trajectory for the modern game. At the top of the swing, Woods seems to be fighting a closed ("shut") clubface, meaning that the face of the club is pointing toward the sky, as opposed to ideally at the back of his head. That leaves him open to a miss on the right -- the Hank Haney miss -- as an over-correction, but can lead to a snap hook, like Woods hit on the first hole of the tournament. This was arguably Woods' largest swing flaw on display this week.On the downswing, there's a lot to like.First, there is a clear shift of weight from Woods' right side toward his left. Every great golf swing has that. A lot of modern instructors are advising players to utilize the ground to create force instead of the lateral shift, and Woods still does this to some extent with this new-ish swing. However, since Woods no longer loads on the left side to build that power against the ground, he can clear his hips sooner, freeing his arms to get back to the ball with a square clubface and a full release of power at impact. He's not swinging harder, but more efficiently. Woods will still fight some head-bobbing, as he's done for several years now. But, Woods' posture seems more consistent through the swing, which should lead to more consistent results.All told, Woods' changes have been met with almost universal approval, from Haney, to friend Steve Stricker, to Golf Channel analyst Brandel Chamblee, who was no fan of Foley and his methods. While this all isn't to say Woods is fixed technically -- there's still work to do -- it is to say he's on the right path, in a figurative and literal sense, heading into 2015.Now, to work on that short game.Ryan Ballengee is a Yahoo Sports contributor.

"Indications are that airstrikes have slowed ISIL advances. However, the security situation on the ground there remains fluid, with ISIL attempting to gain territory and Kurdish militia continuing to hold out."The US said Saudi Arabia also participated in the airstrikes.The US and its coalition partners have warned of a potential massacre if ISIS successfully takes control of the town.

"Undoubtedly, scientific centers that embrace all peoples are the first line of defense against extremists. And today this university will become a house of wisdom ... a beacon of tolerance."Oil Minister Ali Naimi hailed the university's opening as a pivotal step forward in the oil-rich kingdom's quest to strengthen its economic base."With all the natural resources that God has endowed us, the kingdom is keen to diversify its sources of income for the future," Naimi said in remarks carried by state media.So far 817 students representing 61 different countries are currently enrolled, with 314 beginning classes this month while the rest are scheduled to start in the beginning of 2010. The aim is to expand to 2,000 students within eight to 10 years.Of that total, 15 percent are Saudi, say university officials.The university's financial backing will allow all the students to receive full scholarships covering their tuition plus a stipend.Naimi said environmental research will be a priority at the university where more than 70 international faculty are on board.

She Knows Soaps reported on Nov. 11, Sharon's world starts to crumble all around her. Wednesday's episode preview shows Nick and Sharon telling Faith that they are not getting married. Faith screams at her dad, “You're a liar.” And, he hasn't told her the best part of the news- she is moving out of her mom's house to his tack house. Oh boy, Faith is not going to be a happy girl.They really need to do another paternity test. It is speculation at this point that Faith never used the brush. The hair in the brush could have been all Faith's. No one has addressed if Faith used the hairbrush. Victor is taking the lab technician word that the hair was from one person. Could the one person have been Faith? Fans can dislike Sharon or Phyllis all they want, but Summer and Faith do not deserve all the drama.Is there anything that can be done to salvage Sharon and Nick relationship? According to Soap in Depth, Sharon Case said their relationship is tested, but not completely over. Right now, Nick is extremely hurt. Can they pick up the pieces after this mess, or is he completely washing his hands of Sharon forever? Only time will tell.Mariah brought up a very interesting point in her talk with Victor a couple weeks ago. Nick is not like him at all, perhaps Nick is not his son. He is much more like Jack. According to She Knows Soaps forums, many speculate the real paternity mix up is Nick. Victor told Mariah that Nick is his son. He mentioned having a test to verify. The DNA test back when Nick was a child was not as precise as they are today. Is it possible there was a mistake? Could Jack be Nick's father? The fall out would be huge. It would greatly impact both families. Watch it all unfold on the “Young and the Restless” weekdays on CBS.

We call these fun little cameos "Easter eggs" because, like an Easter egg, they're usually hidden somewhere in the film and it's up to you to find them. You've probably watched Frozen a gazillion times by this point, but did you know the film featured hidden cameos from Mickey Mouse, Rapunzel and more? Disney's Big Hero 6 is no different, as the film is littered with tiny, hidden gems that are difficult to find. Here are a few of them, via Yahoo.Hey, look -- it's Hans from Frozen! The character has a cameo in the film as a statue that Hiro and Baymax blast through while testing out the robot's rocket capabilities for the first time.Since Big Hero 6 is based on a Marvel comic, and since Marvel's Stan Lee is a living legend who cameos in almost every Marvel movie, he gets his Big Hero 6 cameo in this painting hung inside Fred's decked-out mansion.And there's our man Ralph, looking to wreck things as an action figure perched atop Hiro's computer monitor.There are tons of little pictures and notes in the scene where Hiro visits a police officer, including a framed image of a dog on the officer's desk. That dog? It's Bolt! Check out more fun Big Hero 6 cameos over at Yahoo, and tell us if you caught any that we missed.MORE FROM AROUND THE WEB:

The actress tweeted that she got drunk before her interview with the magazine. So what does drunk Anna Kendrick say in an interview?Pretty much the same type of things that sober Anna Kendrick says — unless she's drunk 100% of the time in interviews.

Here are a few highlights:On having her looks scrutinized: "The most common thing that I get is, 'Am I the only one who doesn't think that Anna Kendrick is pretty?' And you're like, 'No, you're not the only one. Arguably, all of the boys in my high school agree with you.'"On taking a short break: "The whole going-movie-to-movie-to-movie thing, I've been living that way for three years. Like I need to be a person and, you know, maintain relationships."On her role as Cinderella in Into the Woods: "The character is thoughtful and complicated. You see what happens after she marries the prince, when you start to face problems in seemingly perfect situations. The interesting thing about her is she overthinks things, she's uncertain – we don't see that in most versions. In a lot of ways, I think it's this incredibly brave story.

http://www.examiner.com/article/wwe-news-ric-flair-claims-daughter-charlotte-has-surpassed-him-talent	WWE news: Ric Flair claims daughter Charlotte has surpassed him in talent	Play WWE news: Ric Flair claims daughter Charlotte has already surpassed him in talent YouTubeMany wrestling fans consider “Nature Boy” Ric Flair the greatest professional wrestler of all time. However, PWS reported on Tuesday that Flair said in an interview that his daughter Charlotte has already surpassed him as a wrestler. Charlotte is the current WWE NXT Divas champion and is expected to join the main WWE roster in a short time.Photo from TwitterCharlotte isn’t the first Flair child to enter the wrestling business, but she is by far the most talented. His son David Flair wrestled in WCW, and while he held titles in WCW and the NWA, he was never that good and always looked awkward in the ring. Reid Flair made his debut in 2008 after being trained by Harley Race. Reid passed away in 2013 after an accidental drug overdose.Charlotte, whose real name is Ashley, signed a deal with WWE NXT in 2012 and began training for her professional wrestling career. It seemed at first that this was just another Flair trying to make it in the wrestling business, but she improved by leaps and bounds. Despite suffering an injury early on, she worked hard to come back and ended up developing into one of the best female wrestlers in NXT, winning the WWE NXT women's title tournament after Paige won the WWE Divas title and surrendered the NXT belt.In the interview, Ric Flair said that Charlotte is more than just an up-and-coming wrestler at this point in her career. He called her the best female wrestler the WWE has ever had. Of course, he is saying this as her father, but he said she has the beauty and the athletic talent to be one of the best of all time and has already surpassed him in wrestling talent. Currently, WWE rumors indicate that Charlotte will be called up to the main roster sometime in 2015.
http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2014/02/19/brett-favre-johnny-manziel-mike-mayock-tony-gonzalez/5609639/	Brett Favre thinks Johnny Manziel may be 'young Brett Favre'	Brett Favre was aware of the chatter. He'd heard people say that the frenetic, go-for-broke, Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback from Texas A&M had a whole lot of Brett Favre in his game.When he finally saw Johnny Manziel play, Favre understood the comparisons."I haven't watched him much," Favre told USA TODAY Sports recently, "but one game I watched, for like three quarters, was the Ole Miss game."Manziel passed for 346 yards and ran for 124 more (plus two TDs) while engineering a 41-38 comeback win for the Aggies in Oxford, Miss., on Oct. 12, 2013."I almost thought I was watching film of a young Brett Favre," said the current Favre, who is 44 and spent 20 years in the NFL."I didn't think I did a lot of things well (in college at Southern Miss), but he did. And and I liked the attitude of 'whatever it takes' — from that standpoint, I liked him."BRIDGEWATER: Should Louisville QB be top pick?TEAMMATE: Manziel not a prima donnaSOE: Your guide to 2014 combineManziel will be one of the major stories at this week's NFL scouting combine, though he doesn't plan to throw for scouts and personnel executives until March 27.He's sure to be a tricky evaluation. Despite some similarities to Favre, who was a decent scrambler as a youth but not an electric open-field runner, it's hard to find any NFL quarterback — past or present — with a skill set congruent to Manziel's."He was like a combination of Fran Tarkenton and Doug Flutie," says NFL Network chief draft analyst Mike Mayock, citing two scramblers closer in stature to Manziel's 6-0, 210-pound frame.Mayock is among those who love Manziel's arm, athleticism and improvisational skills but worry about his accuracy and ability to operate from the pocket. But he believes Johnny Football could be a top-five pick in May even if he doesn't even truly emulate new wave NFL quarterbacks such as Andrew Luck, Robert Griffin III or Russell Wilson."He's different than any quarterback I've (studied) before," said Mayock. "But I believe in the kid."So does new CBS analyst and longtime NFL tight end Tony Gonzalez, who does see a current (and cautionary) comparison."Johnny's more along the lines of RG3, which could hurt him," Gonzalez told USA TODAY Sports. "He'll make a good transition to the NFL but, for me, he needs to work on that pocket passing. There's such a thing as young running quarterbacks, but not old running quarterbacks."Manziel might be wise to heed the example of Wilson, who can make plays with his legs but always keeps his eyes downfield and only takes off as a runner as a last resort. Griffin's willingness to pull the ball down and use his world-class speed has produced big plays for the Washington Redskins, but the injuries he's already absorbed create concerns about his longevity if he doesn't evolve as a more effective pocket passer.But Favre, who owns most of the NFL's major passing records, thinks Manziel is already further along than he was when he entered the league as a second-round pick in 1991."I didn't throw near as well as him," said Favre. "He may have that capability — unbelievable throws and can makes plays with his feet."I was impressed."***Follow Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavisPHOTOS: 14 offensive players to monitor at '14 scouting combine

http://news.yahoo.com/russian-bomber-patrols-reach-gulf-mexico-140508309.html	Russian bomber patrols to reach Gulf of Mexico	MOSCOW (AP) — Russia's long-range bombers will conduct regular patrol missions from the Arctic Ocean to the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico, the military said Wednesday, a show of muscle reflecting tensions with the West over Ukraine.A statement from Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu came as NATO's chief commander accused Moscow of sending new troops and tanks into Ukraine — a claim quickly rejected by Russia.Shoigu said the tensions with the West over Ukraine would require Russia to also beef up its forces in the Crimea, the Black Sea Peninsula that Russia annexed in March.He said Russian long-range bombers will conduct flights along Russian borders and over the Arctic Ocean. He added that "in the current situation we have to maintain military presence in the western Atlantic and eastern Pacific, as well as the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico."He said that the increasing pace and duration of flights would require stronger maintenance efforts and relevant directives have been issued to industries.Russian nuclear-capable strategic bombers were making regular patrols across the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans during Cold War times, but the post-Soviet money crunch forced the military to cut back. The bomber patrol flights have resumed under President Vladimir Putin's tenure.View gallery In this Tuesday, Aug. 16, 2005 file photo, wearing a flying gear Russian President Vladimir Putin ho …The patrols have become even more frequent in recent weeks with NATO reporting a spike in Russian military flights over the Black, Baltic and North seas as well as the Atlantic Ocean.Earlier this year, Shoigu said that Russia plans to expand its worldwide military presence by seeking permission for navy ships to use ports in Latin America, Asia and elsewhere for replenishing supplies and doing maintenance. He said the military was conducting talks with Algeria, Cyprus, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Cuba, Seychelles, Vietnam and Singapore.Shoigu said Russia was also talking to some of those countries about allowing long-range bombers to use their air bases for refueling.A senior U.S. military official said that Russia has not previously flown actual bomber patrols over the Gulf of Mexico, including during the Cold War.Long-range bombers have been in the area before, but only to participate in various visits to the region when the aircraft stopped over night at locations in South or Central America. During the Cold War, other types of Russian aircraft flew patrols there, including surveillance flights and anti-submarine aircraft.View gallery In this Wednesday, May 7, 2014 file photo Russian Air Force strategic bombers, Tu-95, fly in formati …The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to discuss the flights publicly, also said that the pace of Russian flights around North America, including the Arctic, have largely remained steady, with about five incidents per year.Col. Steve Warren, a Pentagon spokesman, declined to call this a Russian provocation. He said the Russians have a right, like any other nation, to operate in international airspace and in international waters. The important thing, Warren said, is for such exercises to be carried out safely and in accordance with international standards.Ian Kearns, director of the European Leadership Network, a London-based think tank, said the bomber patrols were part of Kremlin's efforts to make the Russian military "more visible and more assertive in its actions."The new bomber flights "aren't necessarily presaging a threat," Kearns said. "They are just part of a general ramping-up of activities."But he said "the more instances you have of NATO and Russian forces coming close together, the more chance there is of having something bad happening, even if it's not intentional."View gallery This Thursday, Sept. 28, 2006 file photo provided by the U.S. Air Force shows an F-15C Eagle from th …On Monday, the European Leadership Network issued a report that found a sharp rise in Russian-NATO military encounters since the Kremlin's annexation of Crimea, including violations of national airspace, narrowly avoided mid-air collisions, close encounters at sea, harassment of reconnaissance planes, close overflights over warships and Russian mock bombing raid missions.Three of the nearly 40 incidents, the think tank said, carried a "high probability" of causing casualties or triggering a direct military confrontation: a narrowly avoided collision between a civilian airliner and a Russian surveillance plane, the abduction of an Estonian intelligence officer and a large-scale Swedish hunt for a suspected Russian submarine that yielded no result.In September, the report said, Russian strategic bombers in the Labrador Sea off Canada practiced cruise missile strikes on the U.S. Earlier this year, in May, the report said, Russian military aircraft approached within 50 miles (80 kilometers) of the California coast, the closest such Russian military flight reported since the end of the Cold War.Russia-West ties have dipped to their lowest point since Cold War times over the Kremlin's annexation of Crimea and support for pro-Russia insurgents in Ukraine. The West and Ukraine have continuously accused Moscow of fueling the rebellion in eastern Ukraine with troops and weapons — claims Russia has rejected.Fighting has continued in the east despite a cease-fire agreement between Ukraine and the rebels signed in September, and Ukraine and the West accused Russia recently of sending in new troops and weapons.U.S. Gen. Philip Breedlove said Wednesday that in the last two days "we have seen columns of Russian equipment, primarily Russian tanks, Russian artillery, Russian air defense systems and Russian combat troops entering into Ukraine."Breedlove, who spoke in Sofia, Bulgaria, wouldn't say how many new troops and weapons have moved into Ukraine and wouldn't specify how the alliance obtained the information. The Russian Defense Ministry quickly rejected Breedlove's statement as groundless.Breedlove said that the Russia-Ukraine border is "completely wide open," and "forces, money, support, supplies, weapons are flowing back and forth across this border completely at will.""We need to get back to a situation where this international border is respected," he said.___John-Thor Dahlburg in Brussels, Veselin Toshkov in Sofia, Bulgaria, and Lolita C.

http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-12-08/deltas-new-seating-arrangement-somehow-makes-coach-even-worse?campaign_id=yhoo	Delta's New Seating Arrangement Somehow Makes Coach Even Worse	Delta Air Lines has a request for the traveling public: Please don't confuse the bespoke airfares available on our airplanes as anything like what our rivals have to offer. Starting next year, Delta plans to segment its airplane cabins into five sections based on price and service, with three flavors of economy and two premium cabins. The marketing scheme announced on Monday is aimed at identifying certain products and services with particular fare classes, an attempt at creating brand recognition inside the airplane cabin. Coach is so generic, a bland catch-all commodity. Delta wants travelers to instead weigh the distinctions between Main Cabin and Basic Economy, while perhaps considering a splurge on Delta Comfort+, where you'll get extra legroom and a free alcoholic beverage.Delta isn't alone in focusing on in-flight amenities. American Airlines announced plans on Monday to spend $2 billion to bring its fleet up to the same standard as its domestic rivals. The money will bring new seats, Wi-Fi, and electrical power outlets at seats across American's fleet. The giant airline, which merged with US Airways in December, is eager to ditch the 1980s-era MD-80 airplanes that have served as the workhorse of its domestic fleet for three decades.Part of the change at Delta, the third-largest airline in the U.S, means rewriting the vocabulary of status. Business Elite, the old name for Delta's top-of-the-line cabin for long-haul international and cross-country flights, will be replaced by Delta One, which is meant to evoke seats that go flat with linens from the Westin hotel chain. The second-highest service tier, First Class, will be available only on domestic flights.Related: Bloomberg Businessweek's Airport Frustration IndexDelta's news release announcing the five-tier system, which goes into effect on March 1, could have easily been titled: "We Are Not All the Same, Folks." The remaining Big Three global carriers in the U.S. are all deeply committed to creating differences passengers will notice—the starker, the better—as the airline giants battle the commodification of travel. The majority of people see little to differentiate a Delta flight from one on United or American, with the vast majority of travelers making choices according to price and travel times.Airlines hate that particular generic framework. They argue that their investments in Wi-Fi service, streaming entertainment, newer seats, and larger overhead bins, among other marginal amenities, should make it clear to savvy travelers that not all carriers are created equal. Delta and United, for example, both allow passengers to stream music, movies, and television shows on personal Wi-Fi-enabled devices without buying Internet access; so far, at least, there's no evidence that it has affected the way we book tickets.On all three airlines, over time, economy will come in a variety of flavors that are based on how much you paid for your ticket. If you pay more or become an elite member of the airline's frequent-flier program, the airline will let you sit in an economy seat with extra leg room. "When a carrier says it is 'refreshing' coach cabin, that's weasel jargon for cutting legroom," travel columnist Joe Brancatelli observed on Twitter. This broad industry effort is likely to make cramped leg room even worse for those sitting in the cheapest seats, although Delta says its new cabin names won't involve any seat reconfigurations.If price trumps all, Delta's cheapest tier, "Basic Economy," will draw most of the attention—even with a long list of restrictions that take effect on Feb. 1—including no advanced seat assignments or the chance to upgrade. That fare is currently offered to only 33 cities from four Delta hubs, mainly on routes where the company competes with Spirit Airlines. But the basic fare is understandably popular, and Delta spokesman Paul Skrbec says it could expand to more cities next year. Still, Delta would much prefer that you splurge on a fancier, pricier ticket.

(AP) — One of two Brown University students who reported rapid intoxication followed by memory loss after drinking punch at a fraternity party tested positive for a date-rape drug, a university official announced in a campus-wide email.The email sent late Saturday by Margaret Klawunn, vice president for campus life and student services at Brown, said tests on the other student remain pending, The Providence Journal reported (http://bit.ly/1snd2T3 ). One of the students also reported being sexually assaulted.The student tested positive for gamma hydroxybutyrate, a date-rape drug also known as GHB, Klawunn wrote."GHB is a colorless, odorless drug that can be hard to detect in a drink," the email said, "but has a strong sedative effect that is incapacitating."The two students reported they experienced "a rapid onset of intoxication" beyond what they expected from the amount they drank, and "memory loss for a significant period of time" after drinking the punch, Klawunn wrote.University officials suspended the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, which hosted the Oct. 17 event at a residential hall.Members of the fraternity said in a recent letter to The Brown Daily Herald that news involving the two students took them by surprise and they were confident "that in no way did any member of Phi Kappa Psi engage in or perpetrate such atrocious and criminal behavior." They said no members of the fraternity have been accused of or criminally charged with sexual assault.School officials are urging students with information about the date-rape drug or the alleged sexual assault to contact university police.___Information from: The Providence Journal, http://www.providencejournal.com

Early results showed that 60 percent of patients experienced some cough relief from after taking the cocoa-based treatment.More from Everyday Health: Mobile Tracking Boosts Weight Loss by 15 Pounds Salty Foods Make Kids Want Sugary Drinks How Much For An MRI? $500? $5,000?The dosage of theobromine used in the trial was 1,000 mg. Unsweetened dark chocolate has about 450 mg of theobromine per ounce, sweet dark chocolate has about 150 mg, and milk chocolate has about 60mg, according to the Daily Mail.While a daily bar of dark chocolate may contain enough theobromine to have an effect on a chronic cough, researcher said, cough symptoms returned in patients who were treated in the study once theobromine treatment ended.Another study, done at the National Heart and Lung Institute in London, showed that theobromine can block the action of the sensory nerves, which halts the cough reflex. That study found theobromine to be more effective than codeine, which is widely used to treat chronic cough.Researchers warned, however, that just because chocolate might have a clinical application doesn’t exempt it from unwanted side effects.“Eating a bar of dark chocolate a day which has high levels of the compound may also be effective for people with diagnosed persistent cough, although eating chocolate on a daily basis may have other unwanted effects, including weight gain and so on,” said study leader Alyn Morice, MD, head of the Hull Cough Clinic in Britain, in the Daily Mail."Chocolate: A Cure For The Common Cough?" originally appeared on Everyday Health.
http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/04/06/drugmaker-spends-millions-fighting-fake-pharmaceuticals/7357799/	Lilly spends millions fighting fake pharmaceuticals	INDIANAPOLIS -- The drug fakery came to the attention of Eli Lilly and Co. in 2007, when a British packager noticed upside-down batch numbers on blister packs of Zyprexa, a popular medicine to treat schizophrenia.Lilly confirmed the foil packs held illegal knockoffs, filled with impurities and containing only 55 to 80 percent of the active ingredient in real Zyprexa. The hunt was on for the counterfeiter.British investigators soon found him: Kevin Xu, a then 37-year-old Chinese national who was shipping the fake Zyprexa to Brussels in drums labeled "carmel colouring." From there, the drugs were moved to Great Britain by a distributor who resold them as legitimate French stock.Arrested and put on trial in the United States in 2008, Xu received a six-year prison term for misbranding and trafficking in counterfeit drugs.Xu's case ranks as one of the most sophisticated illegal drug operations that Lilly's anti-counterfeiting team has helped crack."His packaging was very good. You had a guy with a lot of panache, operating on an international scale," said Michael Russo, Lilly's director of global security for product and asset protection.Lilly has been engaged in anti-counterfeiting efforts for more than 10 years, but thanks to operators like Xu, the Indianapolis drug maker has had to up its game. The best counterfeiters can reproduce Lilly's packaging down to the tiniest of lettering and even product bar codes. They can duplicate the precise shapes and color shades of pills.Lilly's latest move to counter counterfeiters is it's most complex and expensive yet: finding a way to stamp unique codes and serial numbers on every drug package it sells worldwide, so each shipment can be tracked and verified as genuine as it moves from plant to patient. The hope is to weed counterfeit product out of legitimate drug distribution channels, since counterfeiters won't know the right serial numbers to stamp on their fake goods.The serialization program will cost Lilly $110 million, with most of that spent over the next two years.Lilly already was spending millions on anti-counterfeiting. The company keeps a team of seven drug investigators posted on three continents and has built a drug authentication lab in Indianapolis that tests hundreds of suspect drugs a year using a staff of six chemists and others.Lilly has made anti-counterfeiting a priority under its current president, chairman and CEO John Lechleiter. It was one of four founding members of the Alliance for Safe Online Pharmacies, started in 2009 to combat the 50,000 online pharmacies that peddle illicit drugs without prescriptions. The shady world of online pharmacies gives counterfeiters easy entree to patients and enables them to rack up worldwide profits that some estimates put as high as $200 billion a year — nine times the annual sales of Eli Lilly.Lilly "is driving the conversation to get people to pay attention to illegal drug sales," said Libby Baney, executive director of the alliance, based in Washington, D.C.For drug companies, the threat from counterfeiting is obvious: Their brand names appear on a product that often doesn't even deserve to be called medicine. The active ingredient is often missing, replaced by medically useless or harmful fillers like talcum powder or brick dust.And while counterfeiters previously focused on selling knockoffs of lifestyle drugs (like Lilly's erectile dysfunction pill Cialis), increasingly they're selling fake antibiotics and drugs for cancer, blood pressure or heart failure."That's very disturbing to us and has really emboldened the company's commitment" to fight counterfeiting, Russo said.Some of the more sophisticated anti-counterfeiting techniques Lilly uses are color-shifting blister packs, hard-to-duplicate printing on packages, and unusual pill colors and shapes, like its mustard-colored, ovalish-shaped Cialis pills. Like other companies, Lilly also uses covert package protections that its officials won't talk about.The drive to put serial numbers on drugs is happening because governments are starting to require it. Their incentive is not only protecting patients but financial, too: Government-run health systems don't want to pay for fake drugs that make their way into pharmacies and the hands of patients.The coming government mandates mean that more than half of the drugs Lilly sells worldwide will be required to contain product serial numbers by 2018, said Bryan Orton, Lilly's director of serialization and product protection. "It's not necessarily something pharma companies are asking to do," he said, "but we certainly see the value in it."Serialization is not cheap. It requires revamping Lilly's 40 packaging lines globally to install computer-controlled, high-speed stamping equipment. The custom machinery is not exactly off-the-shelf stuff, so Lilly had to design it and test it on a mock packaging line built for $5 million in a warehouse near Indianapolis International Airport.Lilly officials must design their serialization system to mesh with the different standards outlined by European and U.S. drug regulators and also to protect patient privacy, which is a must under federal law.How drug companies will protect patient privacy while they are stamping unique serial numbers on individual drug packs is something that has Larry Ponemon, chairman and founder of the Michigan-based Ponemon Institute, which studies privacy issues, concerned."There's that creepiness factor — this package knows me," Ponemon said. "This has the potential to create some privacy issues down the road."Orton said he's confident that serial numbers can be put on drug packages without breaching patient privacy.Even before serial numbers become commonplace, Lilly officials and others think that counterfeiters are on the run.One reason: Internet search engines such as Google and Bing — under government legal pressure in some cases — have hindered illegal online pharmacies from advertising online, while credit-card companies have blocked their ability to do credit-card transactions, Baney said.There is a problem: New online sales sites keep popping up under new names.John Horton, president of LegitScript, a Portland, Ore., company that rates online pharmacies for their credibility and legitimacy, said most of the 600 to 700 website registrars in the world refuse to grant web names to what he calls "rogue" pharmacies. So most rogue pharmacies now must rely on only a dozen or so such registrars to give them website names, he said."The weakness of rogue Internet pharmacies," Horton said, "is they need to be found."As more of the illegal Internet pharmacies find the web an unwelcome place to do business, Horton predicts the world of counterfeiters will be forced to turn to an old-fashioned way to market their product directly to consumers: telephones.William Reid, senior director of Lilly's global anti-counterfeiting operations, agrees that counterfeiters are being cornered. He credits the drug industry's "holistic strategy" of fighting counterfeiters on several fronts at once."We know the counterfeiters are out there ... and we'll be as vigilant as they are. I'm optimistic ... we will get to a place where we will beat back the counterfeiters."But there is at least one very skilled counterfeiter back on the streets. Xu, who counterfeited Zyprexa and more than 20 other name-brand drugs from his Chinese factory, recently was released from a U.S. prison after serving his sentence."I don't know where he is," Russo said of his old nemesis. "I would be worried his future actions might mimic his past."Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/PAjXMX

http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/576656/20141220/miley-cyrus.org	Miley Cyrus 'Banned' From Patrick Schwarzenegger's Family Christmas Dinner—Report	Miley Cyrus is reportedly causing a major rift within the Kennedy family this festive season, according to a new report. Entertainment outlets have confirmed Cyrus has been on a whirlwind romance with her new found love, Patrick Schwarzenegger, but the singer is purportedly getting the cold shoulder from his mother Maria Shriver.Shriver has reportedly banned the 22-year-old "Wrecking Ball" singer from celebrating Christmas with the Kennedy clan. According to Hollywood Life, the former First Lady of California never approved of her son's attachment with the young singer. Citing Life & Style magazine, the site adds that Shriver allegedly has made it quite clear that Cyrus is not welcome to their house this Christmas.Meanwhile, media reports indicate that Schwarzenegger seems to be smitten by the "Hannah Montana" star. The two, who had reportedly met last Halloween, have been often spotted together at crazy night out parties, with various outlets reporting on supposedly "PDA" photos of the rumoured couple.The photos often give birth to various rumours, ranging from marriage to pregnancy speculations, which reportedly further infuriate Shriver, who allegedly does not want her son to get too attached with the popular teen idol. "She doesn't think it's appropriate to have Miley around the rest of the Kennedy family," an insider tells Life & Style.However, Schwarzenegger is reportedly equally adamant about Cyrus. Hollywood Life reports that he is keen to invite her rumoured lady love to his Massachusetts home for the family's iconic annual Christmas celebration. This issue has supposedly become a big deal in the Kennedy family as the mother–son duo has been reportedly constantly arguing over the same.The Internet is brewing these days with various stories regarding Cyrus' lifestyle. Recently, the singer came down strongly on Life & Style magazine for publishing unverified pregnancy news about her. She slammed the magazine on Instagram. She is also defending herself from those labelling her as a drug addict and alcoholic, after the same publication reported that she needed to go to rehab.Meanwhile, Australian singer and a good friend of Schwarzenegger, Cody Simpson, expressed his support for the young twerking star by claiming that she is a "very sweet and normal" girl, ET Online reported. He had spent a lot of time with the new couple last week and has been quoted as saying Cyrus "impressed" him.To contact the editor, e-mail:
http://nesn.com/2014/10/fantasy-football-brandon-bolden-jace-amaro-among-week-7-waiver-wire-adds/	Fantasy Football: Brandon Bolden, Jace Amaro Among Week 7 Waiver Wire Adds	Don’t think scanning the waiver wire pays off? Let’s take a quick look at Week 6.Who threw the most touchdown passes in the NFL on Sunday? That’d be Joe Flacco, owned in less than 40 percent of ESPN standard leagues. As for the running backs? Three of the league’s six 100-yard rushers in Week 6 — Branden Oliver, Justin Forsett and Ronnie Hillman — went undrafted in virtually all fantasy leagues.OK, we’ll stop rubbing it in. But you get the point. Obviously there’s no way to predict a performance like Flacco’s, but Oliver, Forsett and Hillman all were popular recent waiver wire additions who have validated the hype by producing big dividends.With the rash of injuries that seems to hit the league every week, new opportunities are always popping up. Week 6 certainly was no exception, as a fresh batch of backups could be set for increased production over the next few weeks.Let’s take a look at the latest prospects.Quarterback: Carson Palmer, Arizona Cardinals The great Carson Palmer is back, everybody! OK, so Palmer’s performance against the Washington Redskins wasn’t exactly Hall-of-Fame worthy, but it was serviceable at the very least. The Cardinals have some particularly juicy matchups coming up — at Oakland, vs. Philadelphia, at Dallas, vs. St. Louis — so if you’re hurting at the QB position, Palmer should be a solid source of production over the next month if he can stay healthy.Other quarterbacks to watch: Joe Flacco, Ryan Tannehill, Brian Hoyer, Derek Carr, Jake LockerRunning Back: Brandon Bolden, New England Patriots The Patriots’ big win over the Buffalo Bills on Sunday was tempered by the loss of bell-cow back Stevan Ridley, who could miss the rest of the season after possibly tearing his ACL. The Patriots’ backfield always is a dicey venture, but someone has to fill Ridley’s void, and Shane Vereen has just one rushing touchdown on the season. New England faces a tough matchup against the New York Jets on a short week, but look for the team to turn to Bolden as its goal-line option for the considerable future.Other running backs to watch: Jonathan Stewart, Antone Smith, Jerick McKinnon, Storm Johnson, Isaiah CrowellWide Receiver: Andre Holmes, Oakland Raiders Oakland usually is a Black Hole when it comes to fantasy, but we might have something here with Holmes. The former practice squad player broke out for 121 yards and two touchdowns Sunday and now has three touchdowns in his last two games. He’s clearly Derek Carr’s favorite option, and the Raiders face a Cardinals defense in Week 7 that’s been surprisingly friendly to wide receivers this season. At the very least, he’s worth stashing on your bench as a plug-and-play option.Other wide receivers to watch: Odell Beckham Jr., Cecil Shorts, Brandon LaFell, Mohamed Sanu, Davante AdamsTight End: Jace Amaro, New York Jets After a slow start to his NFL career, Amaro busted out in a big way with 10 receptions for 68 yards and a touchdown Sunday. Geno Smith and the Jets offense are desperately lacking weapons, so the opportunity certainly is there for Amaro to emerge as Smith’s new favorite target. The Jets play a Patriots team that’s without linebacker Jerod Mayo and has been susceptible to big games from tight ends this season, allowing two double-digit performances in the last three weeks.Other tight ends to watch: Scott Chandler, Jordan Reed, Clay Harbor, Jared CookPhoto via Stew Milne/USA TODAY Sports Images

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/kevin-oleary-made-biggest-deal-165848162.html	Kevin O'Leary Made The Biggest Deal In 'Shark Tank' History With This Innovative Wine Company	Shark Tank/ABC Kevin O'Leary toasts Zipz Wine representative Andrew McMurray after striking a deal on "Shark Tank." As soon as Andrew McMurray, chief consultant and representative of Zipz Wine, began presenting his company's line of single-serving wines to the "Shark Tank" investors, they started comparing him to the founder of Zipz competitor Copa Di Vino, James Martin, the only entrepreneur to decline a deal on the show in two appearances.McMurray, however, was more willing to negotiate with the Sharks and was much more comfortable in front of them. He ended up securing the biggest deal in "Shark Tank" history on the most recent episode in the sixth season, landing a $2.5 million investment from Kevin O'Leary in return for 10% equity."I've never been so excited for a #SharkTank deal!" O'Leary, a wine connoisseur and vineyard owner, tweeted after the deal premiered on national television.Zipz sells single servings of wine packaged in sealed, durable plastic glasses. The concept has been around for several years, but McMurray tells the Sharks that the Zipz glass is engineered in a way that allows for a much longer shelf life than its competitors' offerings and is also recyclable, resealable, and incredibly durable. The design is patented.Part of the reason Copa Di Vino's Martin, who's in the same business, is remembered by the Sharks as "obnoxious" and frustrating is that he was unwilling to pursue licensing deals. Zipz Wine, on the other hand, is looking to supplement its own wine offerings with major licensing deals.In its first 16 months, McMurray tells the investors that Zipz made a $130,000 licensing deal with Fetzer Vineyards to get single servings of the wine in six Major League Baseball stadiums. Zipz is also in talks with three of the world's biggest 10 wine producers, including Yellow Tail."In our opinion, our package is going to become to the wine industry what the aluminum can became to the soda industry," McMurray says.He explains that the company already has $8.5 million invested in it over a pool of 25 investors that are primarily Wall Street types and include three owners of professional sports teams. The company has gotten its products into 1,200 US stores, including Wal-Mart locations, and has sold $650,000 of Zipz brand wine since its inception.McMurray says that he's now looking to acquire a Shark for the Zipz board and take it to the next level by securing a distribution deal with the likes of Costco.Eventually, every Shark except for O'Leary declines from making an offer because they don't see eye to eye with McMurray about the direction of the company. But O'Leary, the wine expert, has a connection with Costco, the world's largest wine vendor. In 2013 it sold $1.46 billion worth of wine."Shark Tank"/ABC O'Leary works out a deal while holding a glass of Zipz Wine. O'Leary tells McMurray that he's been in talks with Costco about getting his O'Leary Fine Wines brand into its stores. He said that after first meeting with Costco's wine representative, it took him two years to prove that his name recognition was strong enough to push bottles. But then he needed to determine a way to make the wine more affordable, since 97% of the wine sold in the US is under $10, he explains.He says that the current price of $2.99 for a glass of Zipz wine is simply too expensive. McMurray says he hasn't run into price objections, but O'Leary insists."Everything about selling wine in America is known by their buying team," O'Leary says, referring to Costco. "They know everything. They don't like this price."If McMurray wants Zipz to do $19 million in annual sales through Costco, he's got to get the retail price down to $1.49, O'Leary says, and then he could get Zipz into the wholesale retailer. McMurray says it's possible to reach that point through some package modification and scaling of manufacturing.O'Leary says he'll give McMurray the $2.5 million for a 10% equity stake under the condition that he will be able to buy another $2.5 million of the company at a $25 million valuation in the event of an exit. So if a major corporation buys Zipz down the line for $50 million, for example, O'Leary will be able to own 20% of stock valued at $10 million for a total investment of $5 million.The deal will only go through if O'Leary is able to lock down a contract with Costco.After a call with Zipz partners and some more convincing from O'Leary, McMurray says he's on board.As McMurray spoke with Zipz partners outside of the tank, O'Leary affirmed Lori Greiner's assumption that he plans to use Zipz as his way of getting O'Leary Fine Wines into Costco stores at an affordable price.Following the show's premiere, O'Leary indicated that the Costco deal went through by tweeting this photo of a single serving of O'Leary Cabernet in a Zipz package. While it has yet to be confirmed, the "Shark Tank" deal with Zipz was contingent on a Costco contract.O'Leary's investment outdoes the last biggest "Shark Tank" deal, Mark Cuban's $2 million investment in live horror entertainment company Ten Thirty One Productions, by $500,000. In a recent Bloomberg "Masters in Business" podcast, Cuban explains that as the popularity of "Shark Tank" has exploded over the past couple seasons, the quality of entries and the frequency of relatively big investments has increased as well.You can watch the full episode over at Hulu Plus.More From Business InsiderThe 12 Biggest 'Shark Tank' Success Stories Mark Cuban Explains The Real Reason He Joined The 'Shark Tank' Cast 'Shark Tank' Investors Pick 8 Of The Show's Most Outrageous Pitches
http://www.foxnews.com/science/2014/11/05/balloon-pods-to-bridge-space-tourism-gap/	Balloon ‘pods’ to bridge space tourism gap	After a breakfast of orange juice and strawberry short cake, in a duct-taped pressure suit, Joseph W. Kittinger stepped up onto the back of a flatbed truck and readied himself to take the “longest step in the world.”“Here in the eerie silence of space, I knew that my life depended entirely upon my equipment, my own actions, and the presence of God,” writes the U.S. Air Force captain in a 1960 issue of ‘National Geographic Magazine’.Dangling from a crane, his open gondola hoisted into the air. The assent would take over an hour. If anything failed as he jumped from the high-altitude balloon, he would lose consciousness in 1 to 12 seconds and be dead in 2 minutes. Just months before, the parachute wrapped around his neck at 76,000 feet, sending him spinning, plummeting towards the earth in a free fall before the reserve chute opened at 10,000 feet.He sends a message to the ground. “There is a hostile sky above me. Man will never conquer space. He may live in it, but he will never conquer it. The sky above is void, very black and very hostile."Kittinger’s mission, vital to testing life-support systems in the pre-dawn era of manned spaceflight, laid the foundation for a new segment in the burgeoning space tourism market and two men, each with astrophysicist fathers, are hurtling into the field with high-performance balloon ‘pods’ promising to take tourists to the edge of space.   “The dream is safe, comfortable, without fear or trepidation to float through a starlit sky at dawn watching the light come across the planet with your favorite drink and favorite friend,” says World View Enterprises founder Taber MacCallum. MacCallum, whose father worked on the Wright Brothers’ propellers, was part of the team behind Google executive Alan Eustace’s recent record-setting jump from 135,872 feet. As a longtime space researcher, he even participated in a two-year moon colony isolation experiment in the 1990’s. He envisions one-to-two-hour voyages aboard a luxury capsule equipped with a bar and bathrooms in sail-like journeys for two crew members and six passengers. The $75,000 ticket will strap in passengers for take-off and landing in a Wi-Fi enabled craft for the ultimate selfie. According to the company, several flights are sold out for the 2016 inaugural launch.He says the World View experience will be less for adrenaline junkies but adventure seekers and space enthusiasts looking for a “calmer” ride.In the wake of two commercial space tragedies, particularly the loss of Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo, aerospace engineer and entrepreneur José Mariano López-Urdiales is even more convinced high-altitude balloons are the ideal transition for the industry as the “next feasible cost effective step to bring space closer to people.”“It's a stark reminder that engineering and rigor has to take precedence over public relations and spin if one wants to move beyond selling tickets and into a fully operational industry,” says López-Urdiales. “The opportunity is still there since the Russians still sell tickets at $60 million, and have a three-year waiting list, anything below that price that works has a market but it has to be done in a different way."His company Zero2infinity has been working on high-performance balloon rides since 2009 for an experience which will take tourists to a height of 22 miles for $150,000.  The flights will be launched from Spain.Full weightlessness is not an option on balloon capsule voyages. However, when the capsule detaches from the balloon and transitions to the parafoil, passengers will experience a few seconds of reduced gravity.  Both World View Enterprises and Zero2infinity use similar technology, which in essence uses a high-altitude balloon to lift a capsule, equipped with a parachute, or “para-wing,” for the journey along the edge of space.   While full weightlessness is not an option on these trips, when the capsule detaches from the balloon and transitions to the para-wing passengers will experience a few seconds of reduced gravity and see the earth against the blackness of space via 360 degree capsule window seats.A 2012 Tauri Group market analysis on sub-orbital space tourism estimated that 40 percent of the 8,000 high net-worth individuals surveyed would be interested in sub-orbital flights.  However, could offering a “taste” of space bridge the gap between NASA’s human spaceflight launches and the rocket rides being tested by commercial space tourism companies. “That is the hope of the space community,” says John Logsdon, professor emeritus of political science and international affairs at George Washington University's Space Policy Institute. “Are you going to give astronaut wings to every space tourist? It trivializes the definition of the astronaut. I don’t think so.”  MacCallum says his goal is a fundamental change in the perception of the planet. “Not, in a tree-huggy way,” he adds. “Just like those first pictures of the moon and the earth in the 1960’s, space tourism will provide a visceral experience that will change man’s view of our world.”

http://www.refinery29.com/cindy-crawford-daughter-kaia-gerber-instagram-pic	Cindy Crawford's 13-Year-Old Daughter Is The Spitting Image Of Her Mom	For those of us without a supermodel for a mom (and a dad who dabbled in modeling and happens to be besties with George Clooney), 13 was a rough year. You were not a girl, not yet a woman — but not quite human, either, what with all the orthodontia, runaway hygiene issues, and optic and dermatological aids. So, when your parents pulled out the camera to capture a sweet, candid kid-moment to show off to their friends, you likely shielded your face, shrieked "OHMYGOD DAD, STOP" and escaped to your room to collapse dramatically on top of your Avenged Sevenfold duvet.If you're Cindy Crawford and Rande Gerber's spawn, though, you'd flash a practiced smile and show off the contents of your baking dish like it's Chanel's new fragrance. Those brows? Check. That multi-million-dollar-beauty-contract-winning hair? Yep — Kaia Gerber was born with it all right.Rande's truly dad-like caption reads: "Sunday Baking. Brownies with roasted marshmallows," and his commenter-buds were quick to provide exclamation-pointed advice. "Seriously protect her Rande she's too beautiful to let out doors!!!" and "omg rands i'm scared! she is so stunning" and "Keep her in the kitchen because she is way too beautiful to be exposed to all those boys lurking. Wow." Wow, indeed. Note to Rande: Great pic, but get new friends. The good news is Kaia's already an old pro at being scrutinized by the public eye.Keep reading to see her first fashion campaign.Photo: Courtesy of Versace Young.In 2012, a 10-year-old Kaia appeared in Versace Young ads, and some pearl-clutchers called her short skirt and sophisticated pose provocative, criticizing Cindy's parenting in the process. In response to questions about her daughter's potential budding career, Crawford famously told the Daily Mail, "She's too young to pursue a career. There aren't even a handful of jobs for a 10-year-old girl. But, if she's 16 and wants to try it, of course, what can I say?" Remember, Crawford herself was discovered when she was 16.For now, let's all agree that Kaia should just be busying herself with being a kid. Whether she grows up to pursue modeling, computer programming, global health policy, or unicorn wrangling, that's a decision to be made in the future (at least after she's taken Algebra II). Right now, she's probably much more worried about whether those brownies also need a caramel drizzle.Want more of the celeb stuff? Ariana Grande Finally Let Her Hair Down (Literally)

http://www.kansascity.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/barbara-shelly/article31046568.html	Why Kurt Schaefer is the scariest person in Missouri government	If someone were to ask me who is the scariest person in the Missouri government right now, I would say Kurt Schaefer.This is quite a distinction. The state Capitol, as we have learned, has its share of intern harassers and after-hours miscreants. Schaefer, the Republican senator from Columbia, is neither of those.He is a different kind of scary — a politician with the talent and ambition to acquire power and a willingness to misuse it.Schaefer is chairman of the Missouri Senate’s appropriations committee. That gives him an outsized voice in who or what receives state funding. He also is a candidate to be Missouri’s next attorney general. Those two roles have proven to be a dangerous combination.Barely a week goes by any more without Schaefer setting off some type of tremor.There he was on Thursday berating staffers at the state Department of Health and Senior Services at a “sanctity of life committee” hearing, grasping for some kind of irregularity in Planned Parenthood’s application to resume abortion services at its Columbia clinic.There he was last month suggesting that the General Assembly should wipe out Kansas City’s earnings tax in retaliation for the City Council’s ordinance increasing the minimum wage.And the legislature isn’t even in session.Schaefer’s frenetic activity has to do with his attorney general campaign. He has a GOP primary opponent, Josh Hawley, whose impeccable conservative credentials include arguing before the U.S. Supreme Court on behalf of “religious freedom” in the contraceptives case involving the Hobby Lobby stores.Hawley teaches at the University of Missouri School of Law in Columbia, which has granted him a leave of absence without pay in order to campaign. The university is now juggling multiple Sunshine Law requests related to that decision. Schaefer’s allies want to know if Hawley received any undue consideration in obtaining the leave. Hawley’s allies want to know if Schaefer hinted at budgetary consequences if the university granted the leave.So far, there is nothing concrete to confirm either suspicion. But the early nasty tone of the attorney general’s race has put Schaefer in pitbull mode.A lawyer and former Missouri assistant attorney general, he entered political life as a moderate. He gained a reputation for being smart and pragmatic and landed the coveted appropriations chairmanship. He won re-election easily in 2012.Then everything changed. Looking ahead to his statewide race, Schaefer made a hard, screeching turn to the right. And he began using his Senate chairmanship as political muscle.When word got out in 2013 that the Department of Revenue was scanning driver’s license documents, including concealed carry permits, into a database, Schaefer proposed cutting the budget of the motor vehicle division by a third. Better not to issue licenses at all than to violate the privacy of gun owners, he reasoned.This year, Schaefer used the budget process to make Medicaid funding contingent on the state hiring for-profit managed care companies to administer much of the program. Using threats and sheer stamina, Schaefer got the legislature to go along with the dramatic change without hearings or even much information. The state is now trying to figure out how to make the transition work.Schaefer’s power-mongering is another toxic aspect of Missouri government. People inside of government are overly cowed by him. And people outside of government already are weighing the repercussions of donating to Schaefer’s political opponent.If Schaefer wants to make a stand for good government, he’ll resign from his appropriations chairmanship to avoid the appearance of more power plays while he’s running for attorney general.If he won’t — which seems likely — then the Senate’s incoming new leadership should take the decision out of his hands.
http://mashable.com/2014/12/02/conflict-free-minerals-problem/	The human cost of conflict-free minerals	Diggers search for coltan and tourmaline in a mine in Numbi, South KivuElectronics companies funded roughly 15 years of civil wars in Congo by supporting the black market for tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold. Collectively referred to as “3Ts and gold,” the $2 billion conflict mineral market kept guns loaded, boots polished and private armies fed for warlords, prolonging decades of terror within the country.For instance, General Bosco Ntaganda, nicknamed “The Terminator” for an unchecked five-year period of murder and mass rape conducted by his rebel group, supported a taste for fine wines and lavish homes with taxes collected from mines in North and South Kivu. A 2011 United Nations report claimed Ntaganda was making $15,000 per week at just one border crossing alone. (The country's average per capita income is $680, with a 71.3% poverty rate.)The power struggle between various armed groups in the DRC has been called the deadliest conflict since World War II. More than 5 million people were killed and another 2 million were displaced. Congolese soldiers systematically raped tens of thousands of women in an unprecedented display of sexual violence as a weapon of war. Many of the victims were children.The Dodd-Frank law was created with the intent to prevent even more wars by stemming the source of their funding, but the policy shift came with unplanned collateral damage: The livelihoods of thousands of Congolese miners."Black markets have innocent beneficiaries,” said Toby Whitney, former legislative director of Rep. Jim McDermott, who worked on the law’s conflict minerals provision. “When you break a black market, some of the innocent beneficiaries of the black market will no longer be able to benefit from it. The Central African mineral black market has been one of the largest black markets in the world for decades. It was fueling the war to burn hotter than it would have, otherwise.”Whitney added, “This is about the math of lives. You can choose to keep the black market going, but at the cost of violence done unto other people a hundred miles away.”"Westerners are the people who handle all the politics,” Pascal Tshikaya Kamina told me as we sat in his backyard while he separated grains of coltan from cassiterite with a magnet. Coltan, he claims, used to fetch $120 a kilogram. Now, it sells for a paltry $20. Cassiterite went for $15 a kilo, but has since dropped to $5.“The Obama Law did not help us at all,” Kamina said. “There are other places in Africa that also suffer from conflict, but they never put a ban on their minerals.”The middle-aged Kamina became a miner at 14. With his earnings, he built a home and started a family, but now can barely make ends meet as the past few years bore witness to the rapid devaluation of his labor.“Before the law, life was good,” said Kamina. “Today, a life of digging minerals is a life of hardship."Kamina recalled his life before the Dodd-Frank Act: regular meals and warm clothing, essential in the mountain climate. Bread, cheese and wild honey for supper; tall bottles of pale beer and roasted meat on special occasions. The good days, he said, are simply a memory.Like many miners, Kamina cannot think of another way to make a living, save for joining a rebel group out in the bush. Armed insurgents in the region who no longer control mines allegedly make money by robbing banks and collecting illegal taxes and tolls.He blames the law for an increasing number of crimes in eastern Congo.“Many people in Congo are in prison because of the low prices of minerals,” he said. “Hunger can make a bandit out of anyone.”
http://www.cbsnews.com/news/does-smart-drug-really-help-people-focus/	Does "smart drug," modafinil or Provigil, really help people focus?	Rostislav SedlacekThe "smart drug" modafinil actually does work for some people, improving their performance on long and complex tasks, also enhancing decision-making and planning skills, a new review of studies finds.Modafinil, also known by its brand name Provigil, is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat people with sleep disorders such as narcolepsy. But the majority of the drug's users -- such as students who take it to study for exams -- use it off-label, believing it may help them focus. This is despite the lack of strong evidence to date showing that the drug actually works this way."This is the first overview of modafinil's actions in non-sleep-deprived individuals since 2008, and so we were able to include a lot of recent data," Ruairidh McLennan Battleday, a co-author of the new review and a lecturer at the University of Oxford in England, said in a statement. The recent studies of the drug have used more-complex tests of cognition than those employed previously, and found that modafinil indeed enhances thinking, he said.In particular, the drug affects the "'higher-brain functions that rely on contribution from multiple simple cognitive processes," Battleday said.The new findings raise ethical concerns about using modafinil, particularly if it gives students an unfair advantage in preparing for or taking tests, the researchers wrote in their review, published online Thursday Aug. 20 in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology.Past studies showed mixed results for modafinil's effects on healthy, non-sleep-deprived people. However, for the new paper, the researchers reviewed 24 placebo-controlled studies in healthy people that were published between 1990 and 2014. The studies included more than 700 participants total, and tested a variety of aspects of thinking, including planning and decision-making, flexibility, learning, memory, and creativity. [6 Foods That Are Good for Your Brain]Modafinil improved only certain features of cognition, the researchers found. In general, the drug appeared to improve what researchers call executive function, the ability to sift through new information and make plans based on it. Modafinil also somewhat enhanced people's ability to pay attention, learn and remember, the researchers found.But the drug didn't consistently help participants on simple tests of attention, the scientists found. It had "little effect on creativity and motor excitability," they said, and it did not significantly improve people's working memory, flexibility of thought or ability to divide their attention.Modafinil has few side effects. The 70 percent of the studies that looked for mood and side effects found only some instances of insomnia, headache, stomachache or nausea, all of which were also reported in placebo groups."In the face of vanishingly few side effects in these controlled environments, modafinil can be considered a cognitive enhancer," said Anna-Katharine Brem, another co-author of the study and a postdoctoral researcher at Oxford."However, we would like to stress the point that with any method used to enhance cognition, ethical considerations always have to be taken into account: This is an important avenue for future work to explore," Brem said.Follow Laura Geggel on Twitter @LauraGeggel.

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/putin-is-winning-the-oil-war--katusa-020428723.html	Putin is winning the oil war: Katusa	In an exclusive interview with CNN’s Candy Crowley last Sunday, President Obama addressed critics who believed he was too soft on Russia and that he was allowing Russian president Vladimir Putin to “roll America.” According to Obama:There was a spate of stories about how he is the chess master and outmaneuvering the West and outmaneuvering Mr. Obama and this and that and the other. And right now, he's presiding over the collapse of his currency, a major financial crisis and a huge economic contraction. That doesn't sound like somebody who has rolled me or the United States of America.The ruble has fallen sharply in the past few weeks and there are current stories coming out of Russia about potential bank runs. Last week the ruble became the world’s worst performing currency. This week, however, the Russian currency does appear to be stabilizing-- it's back up by 30%. So have sanctions and falling oil prices sunk Russia?Get the Latest Market Data and News with the Yahoo Finance AppNot really says Marin Katusa, author of “The Colder War,” and chief energy investment strategist at Casey Research. Katusa believes that falling oil prices will eventually give Russia the upper hand and deeply injure the U.S. energy industry. The falling ruble makes Russian oil less expensive and more desirable to other countries—Russia also produces oil quite cheaply while the American shale industry has a larger cost of operation. Russia is more than able to weather the current storm, Katusa says. “They have a $200 billion a year trade surplus. They have over $400 billion in reserve currency. They’ve increased their gold reserve. They have much lower debt to their GDP than America. So yes there’s pain in the economy… [but] it's far from terminal.”On Tuesday the Ukrainian Parliament voted to drop its “non-aligned” status and begin work towards a NATO membership. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said this “unproductive” move would only increase tension between Russia and Ukraine. Katusa believes that this is the beginning of another cold war. “The Ukraine parliament only did this after Obama guaranteed hundreds of billions of dollars in military support to fight the Russians,” he says. “And what is critical here is we all know that the logarithmic rule in war when you commit hundreds of millions - it means billions of dollars and through these actions Obama has declared the colder war on Russia.”Katusa believes that this move will result in more atrocities on both sides of the border, but mostly in Ukraine. According to Katusa, sanctions have only made it so that Russia must work more closely with emerging markets like China. “We’ve seen billions of dollars of increase in the currency swaps between China and Russia and it’s going to continue,” he says. Currently about 9% of China’s oil exports come from Russia but Katusa predicts that number will grow significantly in the decades to come.More from Yahoo FinanceCan Twitter be sued for your tweets?The Facebook for the home improvement community: PorchHoliday retailer wrap-up

http://news.yahoo.com/harvard-junior-took-dying-mom-mexico-now-stuck-180131320.html	Harvard junior who took mom to Mexico can return	LOS REYES LA PAZ, Mexico (AP) — A Harvard University student stuck in Mexico for months after breaking an immigration rule was told Tuesday that he will be allowed to return home to the United States.The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service had declared that Dario Guerrero Meneses, an illegal immigrant, effectively deported himself when he crossed the border without permission to accompany his dying mother to clinics offering alternative cancer treatments in Mexico.His mother died in August, and the agency denied Guerrero's initial attempts to return home to his remaining family in California.But only hours after The Associated Press reported on his predicament Tuesday, the agency sent Guerrero a letter through his attorney saying he had been granted humanitarian parole and will be allowed to return after all."Oh my God. I don't know. I feel good!" Guerrero said as the news brought tears of joy to his aunts and cousins. Guerrero said he was excited to resume his education and take up new family responsibilities.This parole is temporary. It lasts for two years and does not give him legal residency, let alone a clear path to U.S. citizenship.View gallery In this Friday, Oct. 3, 2014 photo, Dario Guerrero stands for a portrait at his grandparents' ho …Guerrero, who was brought from Mexico to California by his parents at the age of 2 and only learned of his illegal status as a young adult, was one of hundreds of thousands of young people granted a reprieve from deportation in 2012 by the Obama administration."The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service did a great thing," his attorney Alan Klein said. "He should be back in America in a few days.""This is the perfect (humanitarian parole) case," Klein added. "He knew that he could possibly give up his right to be here so he could take care of his mother. He's the reason we have immigration, and he's the reason we have a Statue of Liberty because he is what we want here."Immigrants in Guerrero's situation aren't allowed to leave the U.S. without government approval, and Guerrero tried to get it.He said he applied through the normal process for travel permission, and then waited a month and a half for a response as his mother's life ebbed away. He twice submitted requests for fast-track handling, and was told to more fully document his mother's condition. He could have tried to plead his case in person but left instead.In this Friday, Oct. 3, 2014 photo, Dario Guerrero, center, poses for a portrait with his grandparen …"My mom had a lot of ups and downs," he said. The chemotherapy and the radiation were no longer working. Doctors had already removed one kidney. "The decision to actually leave was made overnight."Guerrero, who has been staying with his grandparents in a gang-controlled suburb of Mexico City, knew his effort to get an exemption from the rules was a long shot: Last year, the agency approved only about a third of the humanitarian parole petitions it received.Agency spokesman Chris Bentley said earlier Tuesday that "immigration law is complex; anyone considering taking an immigration action needs to clearly understand the potential consequences of that action first."Miami-based immigration attorney Ira Kurzban says it's not infrequent for immigrants to lose their legal status by leaving the country without permission. Some go on cruises thinking they haven't really left the U.S., or leave for family emergencies, only to discover they're barred from returning for 10 years."There's no question (Guerrero) didn't follow the rules. The question is what the penalty should be," Kurzban said.View gallery In this Friday, Oct. 3, 2014 photo, Dario Guerrero stands for a portrait on the rooftop of his grand …Advocates say traveling should be made easier for immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for many years. Visas for skilled H-1B temporary workers already allow travel internationally without preapproval, and giving others this freedom would reduce heartbreak and add only minimal administrative work, Kurzban said.But no such provisions were included in last year's immigration reform bills, and they aren't expected to be included in any executive action President Barack Obama might announce later this year. Kurzban thinks that's because the issue affects a relatively small group, and there are so many other priorities.Former Harvard lecturer Eoin Cannon, who taught history to Guerrero, described him as "one of the most thoughtful and creative and original students that I had the pleasure of teaching," and "an exceptional writer." Guerrero tackled homelessness in one film, and co-produced "A Dream Deferred," a documentary about immigrants like himself at Harvard."He's as American as anyone I know," Cannon said. "The law needs to sort of recognize that and have a mechanism for accounting for that ... For the law not to be able to handle his kind of case is hurting America."Guerrero's parents had kept his immigration status secret for years. They came clean only when he began taking community-college engineering classes while still in high school, and the Social Security number his parents submitted bounced back.View gallery In this Friday, Oct. 3, 2014 photo, Dario Guerrero sits for a portrait in his bedroom with a picture …Guerrero's 16-year-old brother also was by their mother's side when Rocio Meneses Diaz died Aug. 14 at the age of 41 in the central Mexican state of Guanajuato. As a U.S.-born citizen, he was allowed to travel freely.Their father, a building contractor in the U.S. illegally, stayed behind with their 9-year-old sister, also a citizen, at their home in Long Beach. Guerrero now thinks his mother would have been happier living her final days there."But then we still had hope — and if we delayed that treatment any longer because of immigration issues, I don't think I would have been able to forgive myself," he said.Before her death, Guerrero's mom opened up about the family's past and her reasons for leaving Mexico: Her father had been kidnapped twice; her father-in-law and other relatives faced extortion; armed thieves broke into her clothing and jewelry store, holding a knife to her stomach.He recorded her stories and her struggle with kidney cancer. Now he plans to turn it into a documentary when he returns for Harvard's spring semester.View gallery In this Friday, Oct. 3, 2014 photo, film student Dario Guerrero records his surroundings with a vide …Guerrero's mother taught him one more very important lesson.As she got sicker, Guerrero learned that he was going to become a father, with a high school friend from Los Angeles whose baby girl is due this month.He kept his distance during the pregnancy, scared of fatherhood. He kept it a secret from his parents, who pinned their hopes on his education.But while filming his mother, he noticed how she reconnected with her father shortly before dying, in moments she recorded on her cellphone. Guerrero later found dozens of selfies of their intertwined hands."I started asking myself, when my daughter has a son, is she going to show pictures of me?" he said."I'm excited to go back, but I'm also scared," he explained. "I want to go back to school, of course. But I know now what kind of dad I want to be."___Laura Wides-Munoz reported this story from Miami and Cambridge, Massachusetts.

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-deal-iran-could-reset-104500458.html	A U.S. Deal with Iran Could Reset the Balance of Mideast Power	Memo to Secretary of State Kerry:Mr. Secretary,When you arrived in Oman over the weekend to resume talks on Iran’s nuclear program, you must’ve known your pass-or-fail moment is on the line. The deadline for a deal is November 24th, and there’s a lot of work yet to be done.Make this fly and you’ll redeem a record of foreign policy messes you and your boss have accumulated with remarkable, regrettable consistency. Punt now and you’ll take your place on a too-long list of forgettable secretaries. You returned to the table Sunday with some strong cards, but you have deuces and threes, too. You can win with this hand, but playing timid poker will cost you and President Obama the pot. This will take craft, courage and imagination—and, not to add to your anxieties, more of these than you’ve exhibited to date.Related: Obama’s Legacy Extends to Possible Deal with IranHere’s what you’ve got going for you:The overarching task is to settle on a nuclear power program that is restricted enough to extend the time it would take Iran to weaponize nuclear material. O.K., not easy to find the common ground, but some interesting technical solutions to the tougher sticking points are apparently in play.Iran has 19,000 centrifuges and likes it that way—it wants more, indeed—while your side will accept 4,000 or so. A few weeks ago, American nuclear scientists suggested a clever way at this: Remove a specified number of the pipes that carry fuel from one centrifuge to another in the enrichment process—making the count less important and achieving the same result.From Nuclear Threat Initiative: As David Sanger put it in The New York Times piece explaining the idea, Tehran calls in a plumber. Who’s buying into this isn’t clear, at least to us ordinary folk, but it does not appear to be dead as you begin this final phase of talks.Yet more intriguing is the recent idea that Iran exports most of its large uranium stockpile to Russia. The Russians would send back enriched fuel if and when Iran needs it to run the nuclear power program it says is its goal. Again, the centrifuge count can thus be re-reckoned.Fair enough, this idea was floated in 2009 and the Iranians said no when the dreaded Ahmadinejad was president. Now it’s the reformist Hassan Rouhani, and he has supreme leader Ali Khamenei’s backing. In the bargain, Tehran has tentatively agreed to this arrangement -- provided it gets a broader deal defining its rights to a nuclear program.In all of this, Mr. Secretary, don’t get lost in technicalities and lose sight of the bigger picture. As a matter of pure diplomacy, you have things to leverage. Related: Sanctions Will Turn Iran Into Another CubaTehran has its reactionary factions under control now and wants this deal. It wants out of the sanctions regime and into a cooperative relationship so it can work with the U.S. to address the regional crisis. Talk about perverse benefits: The mess the ISIS militias are making starts to look like a positive motivator. Russia wants this deal, too. Moscow sees the Iran talks as a chance to showcase its importance as a constructive global player. Did you read the speech Putin gave in Sochi two weeks ago -- the one you and everyone else in Washington pretended to ignore? In it, the Russian leader singled out Iran as an example of the cooperative relationship he, too, desires to build. Don’t ignore this. On a purely personal level, you’re working with Mohammad Javad Zarif and Sergei Lavrov, the Iranian and Russian foreign ministers respectively. These are among the most capable diplomats now active. Zarif knows Americans well, having studied here. Remember, Lavrov saved your boss’s bacon last year when he got Damascus to give up its chemical weapons, allowing Obama to step back from that red line he unwisely drew in the Syrian sand.Plenty to work with, Mr. Secretary, and therefore plenty to lose. But you’ve got headwinds, too, as follows:Related: Kerry Says No Link Between Iran Talks and Mideast IssuesIsrael has been notably quiet on Iran lately, but who knows what Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Israel American Public Affairs Committee will cook up if a deal starts to look real? When the going gets tough—and you know the rest of the sentence. Same with Congress, which has never been as eager as the White House for rapprochement with Iran—and which now has a Republican majority emboldened by its recent election successes. Other matters rest with you and the White House, and to be honest one worries. You are bringing Russia to the brink of another financial crisis over the Ukraine question, and if you push too hard you could lose the Kremlin’s help and cost yourself a much greater prize. You have to walk and chew gum on this one.There are three things you can do that those favoring an agreement must dearly hope you get done.First, as a tactical matter let the Iranians know you’ll get sanctions lifted as quickly as possible. This is a big one for them. They are hurting Iran across the board and Iranians trust America about as little as Americans trust Iran. It would be a shame not to clear the timing hurdle. Make a deal work like a deal.  Related: Iran Says Nuclear Deal Within Reach by November 24Second and more strategically, look over the Iranian negotiators’ shoulders. Their nuclear program is totemic as an emblem of the equal status they want among nations (a desire the Russians share, incidentally). You must be smart enough to make your deal play to this sensibility. It is real -- operative for those across the table.Third, look over your own shoulder. You and Obama have a big sales job in Congress if you get a deal with Tehran -- you’ll have to do a lot better on Capitol Hill than either of you has done to date. That drink with Mitch McConnell Obama stupidly scoffed at last year? Have it.Did you see Daniel Day Lewis in Lincoln? Abe wanted that 13th Amendment like nothing else, and he pulled every trick and cut every half-cocked deal he had to cut to get it.Want this deal very badly, Mr. Secretary. After three and a half decades of mostly pointless animosity with Iranians, there’s a piece of history to be made with it.Top Reads from The Fiscal Times:Obama on Immigration: How He Could Foul It Up The Threat from Saudi Arabia’s Oil Power Play Russia Hikes Interest Rates as Sanctions Slam Economy
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/11/03/us-house-candidate-in-oklahoma-dies-after-crash/20988095/	US House candidate in Oklahoma dies after crash	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - An 81-year-old Democrat in the race for a U.S. House seat in eastern Oklahoma died from injuries he sustained in a car accident, police said Monday.Earl Emmitt Everett, a retired school teacher and Korean War Veteran, died Sunday at a Tulsa hospital, said Fort Gibson Police Department investigator Stephen Farmer. Everett had been in a two-car accident Friday afternoon in Fort Gibson.Everett was a decided underdog in his race against first-term Republican U.S. Rep. Markwayne Mullin for the 2nd District seat that stretches across 26 eastern Oklahoma counties, from the foothills of the Ozark Mountains in the northeast to the Red River border with Texas in the south. An independent, Jon Douthitt, also is running for the seat.Everett was attempting to cross Highway 62 when he was hit broadside by a westbound vehicle, Farmer said. He was taken by helicopter to a hospital.Everett ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination in 2012. Everett had said he decided to run again because he believed Mullin hadn't done enough for voters in his district. He defeated recent college graduate Joshua Harris-Till in the June primary."We honor the memory of Mr. Everett, a Korean War veteran, and his desire to represent the people of eastern Oklahoma," Oklahoma Democratic Party Chairman Wallace Collins said in a statement. "Anyone that is willing to put their name on a ballot in order to be voted on by their peers as a public servant deserves our admiration and respect."Collins had recently said that the party hadn't had any contact with Everett, even though he was a Democratic nominee.Everett had told The Associated Press that the distance from his home in Fort Gibson to the party's headquarters in Oklahoma City was a problem."I don't have anything against the party, but they're a little bit out of pocket for me," Everett said.More from AOL.com: Police: San Antonio mayor's car hit in drive-by shooting; mayor not targeted White House: Ferguson no-fly didn't restrict press Feds: Islamic State suspect's siblings joined him

He came home, rifled through his wife's phone and Facebook account, and snapped when he saw a photo of her with another man, they said.He pulled a knife from a butcher block as 21-year-old Deisy Garcia slept, chased her from her bed and stabbed her to death, Queens District Attorney Richard A. Brown said. He then hugged and kissed 1-year-old Yoselin and 2-year-old Daniela before repeatedly stabbing them, too.Authorities tracked him to Texas, about 1,700 miles from New York, when he turned on his cellphone. He was captured at a vehicle roadblock on Interstate 10 in Schulenburg, between Houston and San Antonio and about three hours from Mexico.

Korea Urge US Help	Three American citizens being held prisoners in North Korea have called on the United States to send a high-ranking representative to secure their release.The three – Kenneth Bae, Matthew Miller and Jeffrey Fowle – made the remarks in rare interviews set up by the North Korean government with U.S. journalists who are visiting the isolated country.As North Korean officials looked on, the three called for a high-profile U.S. representative to visit North Korea and make a direct appeal for their release.Bae, who is serving a 15-year sentence, said his health is failing and Miller described his own situation as "very urgent." Miller and Fowle are awaiting trials.The U.S. journalists from CNN and the Associated Press, who were on an official visit to North Korea, say they were summoned to conduct the unplanned interviews in Pyongyang. They were given five minutes with each man, they said.State Department calls for releaseState Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said there was no greater priority that the welfare and safety of U.S. citizens abroad. She said the department was aware of Monday's developments and called on North Korea to release the Americans. She asked Pyongyong to pardon Bae and grant him amnesty so he could return to his home in Lynwood, Washington, and receive medical care.Psaki said Swedish Embassy representatives in Pyongyang had visited all three U.S. citizens and the embassy has been in touch with the U.S. government.Watch related video report from VOA's Carolyn Presutti:Circumstances varyNorth Korea sentenced Bae to 15 years of hard labor in April 2013 for "hostile acts" against the Pyongyang regime. The Korean-American Christian missionary was arrested in November 2012 while leading a group of tourists in the northern city of Rason.Bae, 46, said he works eight hours a day, six days a week at a labor camp and is being treated "as humanely as possible." He said he spends time going between the labor camp and a hospital.Bae's sister, Terri Chung, appealed to North Korean officials to show mercy and release her brother. She said the video interview clearly showed her brother is in a lot of physical pain and under great stress."It's really hard to watch," Chung said, noting her brother said he was "in complete isolation for the past year and a half. … He doesn't look like himself. He looks like he's under a tremendous amount of stress and he talks about his health failing, so all of that is really hard.'' Bae’s family visited Washington earlier this year to work for his release.  His mother Myung-hee Bae watched her son’s latest interview and came away with the same plea.“I really wanted it to happen right now because his body no longer takes long imprisonment in labor camp clearly his body taken big toll. His body look like it shrink a lot for me and his back aches and he got a sleep disorder, so I really ask our government to act now,” said Myung-hee.  Miller, 24, allegedly tore up his visa on his arrival in Pyongyang April 10 and demanded asylum. During his interview, Miller said he has not yet been tried and will not learn what the charges against him are until his hearing.Fowle, 56, entered North Korea April 29 and is accused of perpetrating activities that violate North Korean law. Diplomatic sources have said he left a Bible in his hotel room. The municipal worker from the Midwestern state of Ohio said he has no complaints about his treatment.The last time the United States negotiated a North Korean prisoner release was in 2009, when former president Bill Clinton returned with journalists Laura Ling and Euna Lee. David Straub, the former director of the State Department’s Korea desk, assisted Clinton with the negotiations. He said this time, the North Koreans are misjudging their leverage.“If I were still in the U.S. government, I would be reluctant to be a party to sending extremely senior Americans to pick up Americans who have been incarcerated. At what point can you continue to do that? At what point does this become a benefit to the North Koreans, allowing them at any point to blackmail the United States?” said Straub.Straub said last month a secret U.S. mission to North Korea was unsuccessful in getting the three men freed.  He thinks the Koreans want to put more pressure on the U.S. government to send a higher level government official.Some information for this report was provided by AP, AFP and Reuters.

http://www.inquisitr.com/1699501/road-rage-woman-terrorizes-two-girls-on-i-80-in-harrowing-video/	Road Rage: Woman Terrorizes Two Girls On I-80 In Harrowing Video	A road rage incident on Interstate 80 in California will have you thinking twice about flipping off the motorists next to you next time there is a dispute.That’s because a woman in a silver truck took it to the extreme in allegedly terrorizing two young women who did just that.Passenger Delanie Strykul claimed that the woman cut her and her friend Vanessa (the driver) off twice and then slowed down to drive alongside their car.At this point, Strykul said she “threw up my hands and flipped her off,” in comments to CBS Sacramento. Following the road rage incident, Strykul admits she wishes she hadn’t.“She pulls in front of us then pulls the car horizontal and stops us.” At this point, Delanie, filming from the passenger seat, called 911.The woman got out of the car and knocked on the women’s window, claiming to be a police officer. From there, Vanessa took off, but the woman got back in her truck and caught up to them.“She did the whole zig-zag in three lanes with her flashers on, kind of like what a police officer would do if they were trying to slow down traffic,” Strykul said.At that point, it gets pretty scary, but rather than describe it, I’ll let you see for yourself. (Warning: NSFW due to strong language from the girls in the video, though after seeing it, who could blame them?)What makes this road rage incident particularly frightening is the fact that it’s real, and you’re left to wonder what the woman would have done had she been able to coax the girls out of their car.As it turns out, police were able to arrest the woman and later identified her as 50-year-old Dierdre Orozco. She will be charged with reckless driving, resisting arrest, and assault with a deadly weapon.CBS notes that the girls “may be forced to see the driver again, because if she intentionally hit their car, they would not be able to file an accident claim. Instead, they would have to take her to civil court to handle damage from the alleged road rage incident.”The Auburn Journal adds that Orozco is now being held at the Placer County Jail. This was her second arrest in a five-day span. The incident recorded in the video above happened just one day after her release from a Roseville jail.What would you have done, readers? Did the young women handle this road rage incident the way you would have? Share your thoughts in our comments section.
http://www.vox.com/2015/1/4/7482385/krugman-chart-valley-despond	This is Paul Krugman's chart of the year, and it's easy to see why	Paul Krugman calls this, from the City University of New York Grad Center's Branko Milanovic, his chart of the year:If you follow economic news, the chart shouldn't be all that surprising. India and China grew dramatically between 1988 and 2008, as did a number of smaller middle-income nations, accounting for the big spike in incomes for the global middle class. Meanwhile, top incomes in developed countries surged while median incomes stagnated, forming that Krugman calls the "valley of despond."Figuring out how to fill in that valley is an important, and extremely difficult, challenge. But the more important task is figuring out how to boost growth of incomes for the world's poorest people. Their incomes grew comparatively less than those of the global middle class, according to Milanovic's numbers, and research by Georgetown's Martin Ravallion suggests that living standards for the world's absolute poorest people have risen less than most poverty metrics show.

http://www.aol.com/article/2014/12/06/more-us-troops-than-planned-to-stay-afghanistan/21003792/	More US troops than planned to stay Afghanistan	KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) - U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Saturday the United States will keep as many as 1,000 more troops in Afghanistan than planned for the first part of 2015.At a news conference at the presidential palace with President Ashraf Ghani, Hagel said the original plan to cut U.S. troop levels to 9,800 by the end of this year had been abandoned, but not because of a recent surge in Taliban attacks.Hagel said the U.S. will keep up to 10,800 troops for the first few months of next year and then restart the drawdown, which is scheduled to reach 5,500 troops by the end of 2015.The U.S. decided to keep additional forces in the country temporarily because planned troop commitments by U.S. allies for a NATO train-and-assist mission starting in January have been slow to materialize.President Barack Obama "has provided U.S. military commanders the flexibility to manage any temporary force shortfall that we might experience for a few months as we allow for coalition troops to arrive in theater," he said. "But the president's authorization will not change our troops' missions, or the long-term timeline for our drawdown," he added.On his final visit to Afghanistan as U.S. defense secretary, Hagel said with striking optimism that he believes Afghans will successfully put down a surge in Taliban attacks in the capital and stabilize the nation.Hagel arrived in Kabul on a previously unannounced trip one day after Obama declared he would nominate one of Hagel's former deputies, Ashton Carter, to succeed Hagel, who resigned under pressure Nov. 24.In an interview with reporters traveling with him from Washington aboard a military aircraft, Hagel was in a reflective mood about America's longest war. He recalled arriving in Kabul in January 2002 as a member of a congressional delegation when security was so dicey that the lawmakers arrived under cover of darkness and left before dawn. Hagel at the time was a Republican senator from Nebraska.The Taliban, which had ruled Afghanistan since 1996, were forced from power in late 2001 just weeks after a U.S.-led invasion prompted by the 9/11 terrorist attacks. But they recovered gradually after the U.S. shifted its military focus to Iraq in 2003, and by 2008 the U.S. was conceding that the war in Afghanistan was stalemated.Hagel, on his fourth trip to Afghanistan as defense secretary, said it should not be surprising that the Taliban are still able to launch significant attacks in the capital."The Taliban are going to continue to have pockets of resurgence, and it's predictable that they would do everything they possibly could to disrupt" the new Afghan government under Ghani and Chief Executive Officer Abdullah Abdullah, Hagel said.The Taliban clearly are aiming to disrupt the new government and undermine confidence in it. But Hagel said they have failed thus far and are unlikely to ever succeed."I have confidence in the Afghan security forces that they will continue to meet these challenges," he said.Hagel said that during his visit he intended to discuss with Ghani and Abdullah the state of security in Kabul and ways that it can be improved. He said the main reason for his visit is to reinforce support for their new government, reiterate a long-term U.S. commitment here and to thank American troops.The U.S.-led war in Afghanistan has lasted far longer than anyone predicted at the outset in October 2001, and the final result, after more than 2,200 U.S. deaths, remains in doubt even as Obama officially ends the U.S. combat mission Dec. 31.Hagel said that in hindsight the struggle to prevent Afghanistan from reverting to a haven for al-Qaida has been difficult but worthwhile."As difficult, as challenging, as long as this has been, by any definition the country of Afghanistan, the people of Afghanistan, are far better off today than they were 13 years ago, if for no other reason than they have the opportunity to decide their own fate, their own way, on their terms," he said."They're not completely there yet, but they've come a long way and that's to the credit certainly of the United States," Hagel said.At the peak in 2010-2011 the U.S. had 100,000 troops in Afghanistan. The Americans have fought alongside troops from a coalition of countries, including Britain, Canada, Australia, Italy, Denmark, Turkey and Poland.About 9,800 U.S. troops are to remain after this year as part of a NATO mission, dubbed Resolute Support, to train and assist Afghan security forces and to carry out counter-terrorism missions. The U.S. troop total is to shrink further to 5,500 by the end of next year but the pace of the decline is yet to be decided.Hagel said he would be consulting with the top U.S. commander here, Army Gen. John Campbell, about the troop drawdown and other issues.

http://www.aol.com/article/2014/08/09/missouri-crowd-after-shooting-kill-the-police/20944493/	Missouri crowd after shooting: 'Kill the police'	By ALAN SCHER ZAGIER FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) -- The fatal shooting of a black teenager by police sent hundreds of angry residents out of their apartments Saturday in a St. Louis suburb, igniting shouts of "kill the police" during a confrontation that lasted several hours.A St. Louis County chapter of the NAACP called for the FBI to look into the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, a predominantly black suburb a few miles north of downtown St. Louis.Brown's grandmother, Desiree Harris, said she saw him running in her neighborhood Saturday afternoon when she passed him in her car. Just minutes later, after she returned home, she heard a commotion and went outside to check on it. Less than two blocks away, she found Brown's body."He was running this way," she said. "When I got up there, my grandson was lying on the pavement. I asked the police what happened. They didn't tell me nothing."The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported several distraught relatives were outside talking with neighbors, including Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, and stepfather, Louis Head. Head held a sign that read: "Ferguson police just executed my unarmed son!!!"The St. Louis County NAACP plans to get to the bottom of the shooting of a young teenager in ferguson by a police officer! - stlcountyNAACP (@stlcountyNAACP) August 9, 2014A spokesman with the St. Louis County Police Department, which is investigating the shooting at the request of the local department, confirmed a Ferguson police officer shot the man. The spokesman didn't give the reason for the shooting. St. Louis County police said a large crowd confronted officers following the shooting, yelling such things as "kill the police."John Gaskin, a member of the St. Louis County NAACP, said the FBI should get involved "to protect the integrity of the investigation." He alluded to the 2012 racially-charged shooting of a 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was subsequently acquitted of murder charges, as well as the death of a New York man from a police chokehold after he was confronted for selling individual cigarettes on the street."With the recent events of a young man killed by the police in New York City and with Trayvon Martin and with all the other African-American young men that have been killed by police officers ... this is a dire concern to the NAACP, especially our local organization," Gaskin said.The police officer who killed Mike Brown has been put on paid administrative leave. #Ferguson - Michael Skolnik (@MichaelSkolnik) August 10, 2014Gaskin said officials in the organization spoke with St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar, who told them teenager had been shot twice.By early Saturday night, dozens of police cars remained parked near the shooting scene as mourners left votive candles, rose petals, a large stuffed animal and other remembrances at a makeshift memorial in the middle of the street. At the height of the post-shooting tensions, police at the scene called for about 60 other police units to respond to the area in Ferguson, a city of about 21,000 residents, about two-thirds of whom are black.Harris said her grandson had recently graduated high school and was looking forward to the future, including possibly attending college."My grandson never even got into a fight," she said. "He was just looking forward to getting on with his life. He was on his way."Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson told the Post-Dispatch that the officer involved has been placed on paid administrative leave."We are hoping for calm and for people to give us a chance to conduct a thorough investigation," Jackson said.Gaskin said the angry crowd was reacting to a "trauma.""Anytime you have this type of event that's taken place, emotions are going to run high," he said. "But for 600 people to gather around an area to see where a man is lying in the street, that means something happened that should have not happened."
http://www.cbssports.com/nba/eye-on-basketball/24796436/report-cavs-kevin-love-will-consider-opt-out-has-eyes-on-lakers	Report: Cavs' Kevin Love will consider opt-out, has eyes on Lakers	Kevin Love is clearly looking for the best angle to flee to LA here. (USATSI)Cleveland Cavaliers fans, welcome to the world of people saying Kevin Love wants to sign with the Los Angeles Lakers.Ever since former Minnesota Timberwolves president David Kahn refused to give Love the five-year max extension off the rookie contract, Love has been rumored to be eyeing a contract with the Lakers. It usually cropped up whenever things with the Wolves weren't going well or it looked like they'd fall short of their playoff goal.It should be no surprise that with the Cavaliers off to a slow start, the Love to Los Angeles rumors have started up yet again. Sam Smith of Bulls.com tells us that Love is considering the opt-out in his contract that would make him an unrestricted free agent this summer and could be looking to signing with the Lakers to return to Los Angeles, where he went to college.It's not going to get as much discussion during the season, but one of the biggest issues for the Cavs is that both LeBron James and Kevin Love own opt outs after this season. LeBron James basically cannot afford to go anywhere after his return to Cleveland. But watch out for Love. Indications are he will seriously consider the opt out and has his eyes on a return to Los Angeles, where he attended college and where the Lakers long have had him on their free agent wish list...Love would consider opting out of his contract. Of course he would, considering he's going to start making a lot more money by signing a new max deal if he opts out now instead of waiting for his deal to expire in 2016. Love has been talking about opting out of his contract for years now, because it makes the most financial sense no matter what decision he makes as far as his next deal. Even if he goes the same route of LeBron James and just signs a two-year max deal to wait to take advantage of the new television money coming in, opting out is the smartest move here by Love.It would be financially foolish for Love to not opt out for the summer of 2015. Love is slated to make $16.7 million in the 2015-16 season and if he opts out and signs a new max deal (regardless of how many years it ends up being), he'd make more than $18.5 million next season.There have been rumors around the NBA of Love and Oklahoma City Thunder point guard Russell Westbrook wanting to team up in Los Angeles at some point in their careers, but there are rumors about all kinds of things in the NBA that never come to fruition.The real question that comes up here for me is how is this allowed on the Bulls' website? The Bulls put this disclaimer at the top of Smith's article saying:The contents of this page have not been reviewed or endorsed by the Chicago Bulls. All opinions expressed by Sam Smith are solely his own and do not reflect the opinions of the Chicago Bulls or its Basketball Operations staff, parent company, partners, or sponsors. His sources are not known to the Bulls and he has no special access to information beyond the access and privileges that go along with being an NBA accredited member of the media.Back in 2013, the Houston Rockets were one of three teams fined by the NBA for tampering charges. The Atlanta Hawks and Sacramento Kings were the other two teams, but the Rockets were fined for an article on the team site that involved players of other teams (Dwight Howard and Chris Paul) that were under contract with other teams but about to become free agents. They were going to be targeted in free agency by the Rockets. Here was the statement from the league at the time:"The conduct at issue involved statements by a team employee to the media, a team email to prospective season ticket purchasers, and articles posted online on a team website, each related to players who are currently under contract to other teams but who will become free agents this summer."The loophole here could be that disclaimer above or the fact that the Bulls aren't believed to be in a position to recruit Love when he becomes a free agent, due to their salary cap and roster situation. The rapper Drake, also the Global Ambassador for the Toronto Raptors, caused the team to get fined for tampering this past summer when he recruited Kevin Durant to sign with the Raptors in 2016. He made the comments about Durant coming to Toronto while performing at his own concert.Had the Raptors put a disclaimer before the concert that Drake's set list hadn't been reviewed or endorsed by the team, would they have saved that tampering fine money?

http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/09/08/benjamin-todd-jealous-naacp-resigns/2780415/	NAACP chief Ben Jealous to resign, cites family reasons	NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous says he wants to spend more time with his wife and children.The man who has become the face of the NAACP — from marches protesting the death of Florida teen Trayvon Martin to vigils for death row inmate Troy Davis in Georgia — is resigning effective Dec. 31.In an interview with USA TODAY, Benjamin Todd Jealous said the constant travel as president and CEO of the nation's largest civil rights organization has kept him away too much from his wife, civil rights lawyer Lia Epperson, and children, daughter Morgan, 7, and Jack, 13 months. He said he plans to make a formal announcement to his staff Monday morning."Leadership knows when to step up and when to step down," Jealous said. "This day I can say with pride that I'm prepared to step down and make room for the next person who will lead this organization to its next chapter."Jealous, 40, said he is talking to a handful of schools within commuting distance of metropolitan Washington about teaching. He plans to continue work with civil rights colleagues toward raising money for a fund to promote black participation in politics. In a separate interview with USA TODAY columnist DeWayne Wickham, Jealous detailed plans to create an "EMILY's list for people of color."WICKHAM: NAACP chief steps down to take next stepThe civil rights leader said he's satisfied that he will leave an organization in much better condition than it was when he took over five years ago. Back then, the Baltimore-based civil rights group was financially shaky and shouldering constant criticism that its aging leadership was out of touch. Now, the organization is solvent, social media savvy and its staff seems to be part of a new cadre of leaders — headed by President Obama — who are diverse, well-educated and visible."In the last five years, we've had double-digit revenue growth, we've spent five years in the black," Jealous said.Under Jealous, the donor base has grown from 16,422 in 2007, just before he started, to 132,543 last year. Revenue has grown from $25.7 million in 2008 to $46 million in 2012. Out of a total score of 70, independent non-profit reviewing organization Charity Navigator gives the NAACP 51.42 for finances and 70 for accountability and transparency.When Jealous came in at age 35, he was hailed as the youngest leader of the organization in its history, although some questioned whether he was old enough to serve, and the board vote approving him was close. As a lifelong activist, he was known in the civil rights community but not by the general public. Over the years, he changed that, appearing in public constantly, often alongside other civil rights leaders. If there was a major regional or national civil rights event, Jealous was often there with rolled-up sleeves.Jealous has had bumps too. In 2010, he faced criticism when he condemned black USDA employee Shirley Sherrod after a deceptively edited video appeared to show her making biased remarks about her work with a white farmer. Sherrod's comments were actually part of a longer speech in which she discussed overcoming her prejudices.Jealous grew up in California, the son of civil rights activists. He was suspended from Columbia University for organizing student protests but returned later to graduate, also becoming a Rhodes Scholar and earning a graduate degree from Oxford. He's worked as an investigative reporter for Mississippi's Jackson Advocate and was founding director of Amnesty International's Human Rights Program.Jealous said a couple of instances reinforced that he needed to move to his next stage in life. His daughter reminded him he'd promised to stay in the job only five years (it was really something, he said, that he told her to appease her). In February 2012, he was two blocks away from home, heading out for a much-needed, non-travel week at the NAACP offices, when he got a call about the death of Trayvon Martin. He went back home, told his wife he'd be gone two days and wound up traveling to Sanford, Fla., on that case many times over the months after that.NAACP board chairwoman Roslyn Brock said Jealous had worked through one three-year contract that the organization had extended by a year and was just beginning his second three-year contract."Truly we were surprised," Brock said of learning the news Wednesday. "We're disappointed that he's leaving at this time. He's five years in, and we were expecting him to be with us seven years, based on our agreement with him."She said the organization understands. "We know his passion for the work, and we could hear the pain in his voice," Brock said. "We looked back over the five years. He has made a sacrifice. But he's left us in a place with a five-year strategic plan."Included in that plan is the continuation of work to eliminate the death penalty and to register 50,000 new voters by Martin Luther King Day in January 2014.Van Jones, host of CNN's Crossfire and former Obama green jobs adviser, said he has known Jealous since they were both student activists, Jones at Yale Law School and Jealous at Columbia undergrad. Jones said he liked the fact that the product of a plan the NAACP pushed years ago — to steer black Americans toward elite educational institutions — has helped return the organization to relevance."Ben Jealous really electrified the organization," Jones said. "You're talking about the oldest civil rights organization on the planet, and it was starting to show. The NAACP before Ben got there was financially in the red and politically marginal. Ben should be on the cover of every business magazine in America as foremost turnaround artist on the American scene."Other civil rights leaders credited Jealous for reaching out beyond the groups that have traditionally worked with the NAACP and stretching old boundaries.Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, a group that advocates for gay and lesbian rights, said that when he assumed his role a little more than a year ago, Ben Jealous reached out and met with him on his first day on the job. Jealous was insistent that both groups work together, and Griffin credits Jealous with pushing the marriage equality measures that have passed in recent years, as well as strengthening previously weak activist ties between the black and lesbian and gay communities."Many times I've called him a modern-day civil rights visionary, and I truly think that is the only description that captures him," Griffin said. "He led the NAACP to embrace marriage equality but also transformed the national conversation of civil rights."Mary Kay Henry, international president of the Service Employees International Union, said Jealous helped expand what's considered the civil rights agenda from the expected voting rights and death penalty cases to issues surrounding the closure of dangerous power plants, early childhood education and health care."He's been incredible in re-energizing the NAACP and taking the national operations to the next level," said Henry, whose group worked with the NAACP to create a fund to advance black participation in politics.Because Jealous does not leave for four months, the organization does not yet have a plan in place for his replacement, Brock said.Jealous suggested the 104-year-old organization might be looking at a woman president."I'm the 17th president of the NAACP and the 17th man. I do expect that the next president of the NAACP will be different in some way," he said with a small laugh.Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/17IwAdY
http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/10/28/kids-death-flu-complications/3179639/	Even healthy kids can die from flu complications	Hundreds have died from flu complications, and most had not gotten the vaccine, CDC says.A new report underscores what health professionals know but parents may not: The flu can be fatal to children, even healthy kids who don't have other medical conditions.Researchers with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 830 kids died from flu-related complications between October 2004 and September 2012, and most of those children had not gotten a flu vaccine. Pneumonia was the most commonly reported complication among the kids who died. Their median age was 7.The report also shows that 43% of the kids who died from flu complications were otherwise healthy and didn't have high-risk medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, certain types of cancer, congenital heart defects or neurological disorders such as cerebral palsy or epilepsy. Children with those types of health problems are at a greater risk of dying from flu complications.The CDC "recommends that all children 6 months or older get the flu vaccine every year, and this report shows that any child can be at risk for severe complications from influenza," says the report's lead author, Karen Wong, a CDC medical officer. These findings reinforce that "prevention is the best strategy, and the best strategy we have is vaccination," she says."The most sobering message is that almost half of these children had no underlying medical condition — these were normal, healthy children," says William Schaffner, professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. He was not involved in this report but is a member of the CDC's advisory committee on immunization practices. "That's a profound fact when you think about it. Everyone in the United States older than 6 months of age should be vaccinated against influenza."Schaffner says children younger than 9 who are receiving the vaccine for the first time need two doses. "If they only get one, it's as though they are not vaccinated that season."CDC director Tom Frieden says, "All too often, people dismiss flu as a mild illness, but every year, children, including healthy children, die from flu."The CDC says 56.6% of kids, ages 6 months to 17 years, got one or more doses of the flu vaccine during the 2012-13 season.The pediatric deaths from the influenza complications are reported to a national surveillance system, but the numbers may be underestimated because they include only deaths that were confirmed by a flu test, Wong says. The tally of 830 deaths doesn't include the 167 pediatric deaths from last year's flu season.STORY: Flu vaccine may help prevent heart attacks in someSTORY: Many types of flu vaccines availableThe flu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat and lungs, the CDC says. The flu can cause mild to severe illness. Signs and symptoms include fever or feeling feverish/chills, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches and fatigue. Some people may have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children than adults.Among the findings from the report, out in November's Pediatrics, published online Monday:• Of the 794 children who died whose medical history was known, 43% had no high-risk medical conditions; 33% had neurological disorders; 12% had genetic or chromosomal disorders.• 35% of the children died before hospital admission. "They died at home or on the way to the hospital or in the emergency room," Wong says.• Children without medical conditions were more likely to die before hospital admission.• 63% of the children died within seven days of the onset of the flu symptoms.• Cerebral palsy, which affects less than 1% of the kids in this country, was reported among 10% of children who died while infected with the flu. Kids with medical conditions such as this should definitely get a vaccine every year, and, as an additional way to protect them, everyone in the household should, too, Wong says.One reason people may not get a flu shot: "There is a myth that the flu vaccine can cause the flu, but that's what it is — a myth. It does not cause the flu," she says.Schaffner says, "The vaccine isn't perfect, but it's good. You might still get the flu, but if you do, it will be a milder case and you are less likely to get the complications of pneumonia, hospitalization and death."Some facts about the flu:• Complications of flu can include bacterial pneumonia, ear infections, sinus infections, dehydration and worsening of chronic medical conditions, such as congestive heart failure, asthma or diabetes.• Most experts believe that flu viruses spread mainly by droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze or talk. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby. Less often, a person might also get flu by touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching his own mouth, eyes or possibly nose.• Certain people are at greater risk for serious complications if they get the flu. They include older people, young children, pregnant women and people with certain health conditions (such as asthma, diabetes or heart disease), as well as those who live in facilities such as nursing homes.• Flu seasons are unpredictable and can be severe. Over a period of 30 years, between 1976 and 2006, estimates of annual flu-associated deaths in the United States range from a low of about 3,000 to a high of about 49,000 people.Source: Centers for Disease Control and PreventionRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1gU7Nud

https://www.yahoo.com/style/are-you-parting-your-hair-the-wrong-way-101278731091.html	Are You Parting Your Hair the Wrong Way?	IF YOU HAVE A Hairline CowlickYou can cut it, style it, and hide it all you want, but that cowlick isn’t going anywhere. And resistance is futile. “This is always a tough one,” says Buckett. “But you have to part hair the way the cowlick’s going.” This hides the section by blending it in. “Either that or you could cut bangs, but they would have to be heavy to weigh down the cowlick or completely cover it,” he says. (We’ve never actually seen Taylor Swift with a cowlick, but these bangs are the right idea.)IF YOU HAVE Blunt BangsBecause bangs frame the face so prominently, “all those rules of positioning go out the window,” says Hawkins. So if you’ve been itching to wear a perfectly centered part, now’s your chance. It will create versatility for the look, allowing it to be styled like a tousled, ’60s Brigitte Bardot; pin straight and chic; or softly curled like Kerry Washington’s.IF YOU HAVE Side-Swept BangsSince it would just look weird to have bangs sweep from the right while the rest of your hair divides on the left, it’s best to form a part wherever your fringe naturally splits. You can mimic Emma Roberts’s swooping style by following this tip from Buckett: Position the part directly above the highest point on your eyebrow arch; it makes your eyes look lifted and flatters any face shape.More from Allure: 34 Hair Ideas for 2014 The Best Sunglasses for Every Face Shape 50 Beauty Products to Try Before You Die Find the Best Haircut for Your Face Shape Top Anti-aging Products $25 and Underphotos: Getty Images
http://news.yahoo.com/students-killing-girlfriend-details-home-defense-125821853.html	Phone call: German student bleeding everywhere	MISSOULA, Montana (AP) — The girlfriend of a Montana man charged with killing a German exchange student in his garage held her face in her hands on the witness stand Friday as the court listened to the emergency call she made the night of the shooting.During the call, Janelle Pflager said 17-year-old Diren Dede was bleeding from "everywhere" and lying face down "barely breathing" after Markus Kaarma shot him. She said Kaarma didn't help her as she tried to aid the mortally wounded Dede. He died a short time later at a Missoula hospital.Pflager's testimony came during the second day of Kaarma's deliberate homicide trial.Prosecutors allege Kaarma baited the victim into sneaking into his garage early April 27 and killed him with four shotgun blasts after being alerted by a motion detector. He says he fired the shots out of fear that his family and property might be harmed following previous burglaries at his home.Pflager testified a day earlier that she bought a baseball bat for safety and set up multiple motion detectors fearing the burglars would return. She said Kaarma brought a shotgun upstairs from the basement, loaded it and kept it in the dining room.Pflager said she planned to use it to hold intruders at bay and said she thought that was Kaarma's thinking about the gun.Deputy County Attorney Jennifer Clark said Kaarma gave no warning before firing into the darkened garage and paused between the third and fourth shots.Testimony indicated Kaarma had been on edge at the time and had exhibited some erratic behavior.Michael McMillan, who works for a local lawn care company, came to the Kaarma house April 23 to spray for insects. While he was setting up, he said an angry Kaarma come out the front door naked, pointed a shotgun at him and asked what McMillan was doing there."I was scared, frozen," McMillan said.He said Pflager started screaming at Kaarma to stop and he went back inside the house. McMillan said Pflager apologized and told him hadn't gotten much sleep due to burglaries. McMillan said he did not call police.That same day, Kaarma went for a haircut, and three women from the shop testified Thursday that they heard him say he had been waiting up nights to shoot an intruder.Defense attorney Paul Ryan said Montana's "stand-your-ground" law allows homeowners to protect their residences with deadly force when they believe they are going to be harmed.Kaarma didn't know whether the person inside the garage was armed, Ryan said. He said Kaarma felt targeted and increasingly anxious for the safety of Pflager and their infant son after the first burglaries.

http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2014/11/7/7176653/dion-waiters-national-anthem-stand-muslim-cavaliers	Dion Waiters skipped national anthem for religious reasons	On Wednesday, before the Cavaliers' game in Utah, those following Cleveland noticed Dion Waiters did not join the team during the pre-game presentation, including the singing of the national anthem. When asked by the Plain Dealer's Chris Haynes, Waiters attributed his absence to his religious beliefs:Waiters informed Northeast Ohio Media Group that he is a Muslim and that he plans to excuse himself prior to the national anthem from here on out. "It's because of my religion," Waiters told NEOMG. "That's why I stayed in the locker room." Waiters says he is rededicating himself more to his Muslim faith. He appears to be in a happier state.Update: Despite being quoted, Waiters called the report a 'damn lie' on Saturday morning:Lol I wasn't going to even say anything about the situation but whoever made that up about me & the national anthem is a damn lie.... — Dionwaiters3 (@dionwaiters3) November 8, 2014I can't believe yall believe everything yall hear smh I guess ppl listen to anything now a days!!! I love everything about America!!!!!!! — Dionwaiters3 (@dionwaiters3) November 8, 2014I'm not here to entertain nobody but come on now I'm always out there for the national anthem if they gone write BS make sure it's correct. — Dionwaiters3 (@dionwaiters3) November 8, 2014I'm logging back off but the media need something to tlk about smh I just had to address the problem... Dnt believe that BS!!! ✌️ — Dionwaiters3 (@dionwaiters3) November 8, 2014As Haynes explains, Waiters was absent not only for the anthem, but for lineup introductions -- a first because it was his first game of the season coming off the bench. In the Cavaliers' next game on Friday in Denver, Waiters remained out of the starting lineup, but did join his teammates for the anthem.Waiters is not the first NBA player to forego standing for the anthem because of his Muslim faith. Nuggets guard Mahmoud Abdul-Raouf famously drew a one-game suspension from the NBA for his refusal to stand.
http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2014/12/5/7343451/giannis-antetokounmpo-traveling-milwaukee-bucks	Giannis Antetokounmpo is making traveling impossible to call	The rules were not designed with him in mind.To the naked eye, this looks like an obvious travel on Giannis Antetokounmpo. How can a player go from well outside the 3-point line to the basket without dribbling? As cool as it looks, shouldn't the rules be enforced?Drill it down deeper, though, and it becomes murkier. The travel rule is often misunderstood to mean two steps and two steps only. In reality, the NBA rulebook states that you get two steps "upon completion of a dribble." In layman's terms: you get two steps and a "gather" step that covers the time between your last dribble and when you put your hand(s) over the ball to terminate that dribble.But this rule was not designed with Greek Freaks in mind. For most players, the gather is easy to identify. They're short and they're dribbling low to the ground, so they aren't taking long leaps between their final dribble and when they cup the ball. Giannis, though, is different. Not only is he tall with arms that extend across skyscrapers, but he has a really high dribble. The process of gathering the ball takes a lot longer than normal human beings, yet it happens so quickly because he's also so fast.Now, to the matter of this play. It was not called a travel, and this was the explanation for why:The question is whether Antetokounmpo's plant actually constitutes a step. Here's the money shot.From this angle, it appears Antetokounmpo has indeed gathered, which would mean that this is a step and thus he should only get one more. But remember: the referee is on the other side of the play, with a clearer view of Antetokounmpo's right hand. Was it really on the ball after all? Clearly, the referee decided in a bang-bang situation that it wasn't, making this Antetokounmpo's gather. And thus, Antetokounmpo had two more steps he could take, which he used by covering the width of the Atlantic Ocean.It's never easy being an official. Antetokounmpo is making the job damn near impossible.★★★

Trailing by two scores, the Lions wanted the ball back, and sent punter Sam Martin to try the rare onside punt. And it worked!It seems an onside punt is actually a bit easier to execute than an onside kick -- on a drop kick, you can pop the ball up as high as you want, which gives your players more than enough time to gather under the ball, and you don't have to bank on the random bounces of an oblong ball. Randall Cobb called for a fair catch, but nobody got under it in time.The Lions were still down a lot late, but props to them for pulling this off.

But the modern façade can't obscure a deeply conservative Islamic country.Saudi women leave a shopping mall in Riyadh on November 7, 2013. Getty ImagesThe malls may sell mini skirts and sexy lingerie, but the female shoppers nearly all wear floor-length black gowns known as abayas, and niqabs that cover everything except their eyes. And - as is the norm in Saudi Arabia - the fast food restaurants are segregated. Men sit at the front; women and families sit in a partitioned area at the back, shielded from public view.Saudi women are also banned from driving, and need a male relative's permission to work and travel overseas.

That vision usually closely resembles what you might find at a restaurant, with elegant plating, refined flavors, and precise cooking. Unfortunately, what ends up on the plate in our homes rarely (if ever) comes close to what you'll find in a restaurant, and there are several reasons why.Click Here to see the Complete List Why Home-Cooked Food Never Tastes Like Restaurant FoodRestaurant kitchens run like well-oiled machines. The equipment is heavy-duty, the tools are the perfect ones for the job, and the cooks know every recipe like the back of their hand -- or, more precisely, know how to make all the food on their menus without consulting recipes more than once, if that. Home kitchens may look nice, but they're almost never well-equipped for turning out restaurant-quality meals.Presentation We eat with our eyes before our mouths, and restaurants spend a whole lot of time figuring out how a finished dish should look, from what kind of plate to use to which garnish pairs best. Put a little extra care into plating, and your guests will be very impressed. Photo Credit: © Flickr / Felix LupaClick Here to See More of Why Home Cooked Food Never Tastes Like Restaurant Food They Know the Tricks Kitchen teams aren’t made of amateurs, and they know every little tip, trick, and hack to make their dishes look and taste perfect. From adding crushed pretzels into breading for that extra crunch, to infusing lemon verbena into the heavy cream, to brining fish and chicken, there are some things chefs learn along the way that no home cook would even think to do. Photo Credit: Shutterstock Their Skills Have Been Perfected When you leave a meal to the professionals, of course you’re going to get a magnificently turned-out dish. From cutting vegetables evenly (which leads to even cooking) to knowing exactly how much of a specific ingredient to add to the pan at exactly the right moment, years of culinary school and on-the-job training can’t be faked. Photo Credit: Shutterstock Click Here to See More of Why Home Cooked Food Never Tastes Like Restaurant Food Everything is Made from Scratch When you open a jar of gravy and use it as a component in your “semi-homemade” meal, you’re adding ingredients like MSG and hydrolyzed soy protein into the mix. High-end restaurants don’t use corner-cutting techniques like that, and the results are obvious from the first bite. Photo Credit: Shutterstock There’s a Team In a professional restaurant kitchen, there’s generally a full team of cooks, and each one has a specific task. For example, to prepare a simple grilled piece of fish with white wine sauce and roasted vegetables, one cook cuts the vegetables, another cooks them, another grills the fish, another makes the sauce, and they all come together in perfect harmony on the plate because each cook is an expert at preparing that one component. At home, there’s usually only one cook in the kitchen, and it’s you. Don’t feel bad when you don’t measure up. Photo Credit: Fuse/ThinkstockClick Here to See More of Why Home Cooked Food Never Tastes Like Restaurant FoodAside from the fact that in restaurant kitchens everything is prepped and ready to go ahead of time, at home the knives aren't as sharp, the recipes might not be memorized, and, well, the person cooking the food isn't a professional chef. And there's a big difference between someone following a cookbook recipe step-by-step and a chef turning out a dish he or she has made a thousand times before.So don't despair, home cook. While the skin on that piece of trout might never be as crisp coming from your nonstick pan as it would be coming from a well-seasoned cast-iron skillet, a home-cooked meal still has advantages over ones from a restaurant kitchen. For one, it's made by you and meant to be shared with friends and family. And at the end of the day, if it tastes good and is made with love, it doesn't need to look like it came from a restaurant. In fact, that might even defeat the purpose of it.

Well, wonder no more. The Catching Fire star revealed exactly how he feels about life after Miley Cyrus. And to say her threw a major burn her way is a serious understatement.During an interview with the Associated Press,These days I feel like I'm more centered and grounded than I've ever been.Translation: My life was a complete shit show with Miley. He goes on to credit his costar Jennifer Lawrence for helping him through the messy breakup.For a few years I went down a path where I forgot to be in the moment and enjoy the moment. But being around someone like Jen, who is so honest and laughs all day long, I am forced to be in the right now. I'm much happier.Oh what a sad turn that relationship took. You may recall that the pair met on the 2010 set of the teen romance The Last Song. But let's be honest here, he really dodged a bullet by breaking up with Miley. It's clear that she has gone off the deep end. It seems in her desperate attempt to shed that cute Disney Hannah Montana image she may be taking things a bit too far.More from The Stir: Miley Cyrus' Eyebrows Are Back & We Are Officially ConfusedHer trashy twerk-a-thon during the MTV Video Music Awards will go down as the most disturbing performance of all time.

If he wasn't "much happier" without her, that would mean he was as crazy as she is. It seems he's way too grounded for Miley's new world.How do you think Miley will respond to Liam's diss?Image via Twitter

http://www.aol.com/article/2014/12/14/friends-say-they-pushed-uva-jackie-to-call-cops/21116105/	Friends say they pushed UVA 'Jackie' to call cops	CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- Three friends of an alleged victim of gang rape at a University of Virginia frat house say a magazine article wrongly portrayed them as uncaring students who were more concerned about their reputations than her well-being.The friends told The Associated Press that the Rolling Stone article was wrong on a number of key points, especially its assertion that they urged the victim to not report the attack.Their alleged indifference was woven into a narrative that used the alleged attack to paint a picture of a culture of sexual violence on college campuses in the United States. The article set off an intense debate about sexual violence, alcohol, fraternities and journalism ethics.One of the friends, a 20-year-old, third-year student referred to as "Randall" in the Rolling Stone article but whose real name is Ryan Duffin, told the AP that not only did he encourage the alleged victim to go to police, but he started to dial 9-1-1 on his cellphone until she begged off saying she just wanted to go back to her dorm and go to sleep."I couldn't help but notice that everything that the article said about me was incorrect," Duffin said.The AP also spoke with the other two friends portrayed in the article: third-year, 20-year-old U.Va. students Kathryn Hendley and Alex Stock, known as "Cindy" and "Andy" in the article. None of the three friends was contacted by Rolling Stone's reporter, Sabrina Rubin Erdely, before the article was published; each of them rejected multiple assertions made in the article, which has since been retracted.All three say Erdely has since reached out to them, and that she has told them she is re-reporting the story. Hendley told the AP Erdely apologized to her for portraying her the way she did.Erdely and Rolling Stone Managing Editor Will Dana did not respond to an email from The Associated Press on Sunday morning seeking comment.The three friends say they continue to work on correcting the record about what happened that night, and at least one, Duffin, wonders to what extent he believes the victim's own version of what happened - or whether any discrepancies in her story matter."People at U.Va. want answers just as much as I do," Duffin says. "But if anything, the takeaway from all this is that I still don't really care if what's presented in this article is true or not because I think it's far more important that people focus on the issue of sexual assault as a whole."Other news media have also interviewed the friends, but this is the first time that Duffin has allowed his full name to be used.A lawyer representing the victim, who has been identified only as "Jackie," has declined several requests by the AP to interview Jackie and did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this article; the AP does not typically name alleged victims of sexual assault.The Rolling Stone article, published last month, described a culture of sexual violence hiding in plain sight at U.Va. The article has roiled the campus and caused a huge backlash, with U.Va. suspending fraternity activities until January, the Board of Visitors appointing an independent investigator to look into the allegations and the university handing the case over to the Charlottesville police.The main focus of the piece is an alleged gang rape that Jackie said happened on Sept. 28, 2012, during her first semester on campus. In the article, she said she had gone out on a date with a classmate named "Drew," who later that night lured her into a secluded room at a frat house. Once inside the room, she said, she was raped by a group of seven fraternity brothers while her date and one other man watched.As described in the Rolling Stone article, a distraught Jackie met her three friends at a picnic table about a 20-minute walk from the frat house and tearfully told them what had happened.While the article said Duffin suggested they take her to the hospital, it described Stock and Hendley as carrying on a debate about what would happen to her reputation and theirs should word get out."The three friends launched into a heated discussion about the social price of reporting Jackie's rape, while Jackie stood beside them, mute in her bloody dress, wishing only to go back to her dorm room and fall into a deep, forgetful sleep," the article said. "Detached, Jackie listened as Cindy prevailed over the group: `She's gonna be the girl who cried rape, and we'll never be allowed into any frat party again.'"However, Hendley told the AP that not only did she not say any of that, she had arrived with Stock to the picnic table only to have Jackie say she didn't want her to be part of the conversation. She said she watched from afar while Stock and Duffin talked with Jackie.Stock confirmed this account.As described by Duffin to the AP, this is what happened: He had returned home from a party when he got a call from Jackie. He left to meet her and she was sitting on the top of a picnic table outside U.Va.'s Fitzhugh dorm. She was shaking and "it looked like she had been crying," Duffin said. "Her lip was quivering, her eyes were darting around. And right then, I put two and two together. I knew she had been on this date and people don't usually look like that after a date."Jackie eventually told Duffin and Stock her version of what happened that night: that she was forced to perform oral sex on five men at the frat house."My first reaction was, 'We need to go to police,'" he said. "I wanted to go to police immediately. I was really forceful on that, actually. And I almost took it to calling (the police) right there." He said he had his phone out, prepared to call 9-1-1, "but she didn't want to and," he remembers thinking, "'I can't do that if she doesn't want to do it.'"Stock corroborated this version of events."Jackie's response was, 'I don't want to,'" Stock said. "'I don't want to do that right now. I just want to go to bed.'"Feeling hamstrung by Jackie's refusal to go to authorities, Duffin said that days later he sought advice from his dorm's resident assistant. Careful not to mention Jackie by name, so the RA wouldn't be obligated to contact police, he said he asked if he should call police even though Jackie didn't want him to. Duffin said the RA told him that he should encourage Jackie to talk with police, but that Duffin couldn't force her to do so.---A previous version of this story incorrectly reported what Jackie told the friends. The friends say she told them she was forced to perform oral sex on five men at the frat.---A previous version of this story incorrectly reported the location of the picnic table where the friends say Jackie told them her story.

http://www.aol.com/article/2014/11/25/storm-may-snarl-trip-for-thanksgiving-travelers/20998604/	Rain, snow to snarl Thanksgiving travel along Eastern Seaboard	MINEOLA, N.Y. (AP) -- Thanksgiving travelers scrambled to change their plans and beat a storm expected to bring snow, slush and rain to the crowded Washington-to-Boston corridor Wednesday on one of the busiest, most stressful days of the year.Forecasters said major Northeast cities will probably see moderate to heavy rain most of the day, though New York and other places were also gearing up for several inches of snow.Higher elevations west of the Interstate 95 corridor could see as much as 6 to 12 inches before the nor'easter exits Wednesday night, meteorologist Andrew Orrison said."I always go on Tuesday to try to avoid the Wednesday rush, but it seems like more people are leaving on Tuesday now," said Bill Fraser, a landscaper from Henniker, New Hampshire, who was taking a train from Boston to New Rochelle, New York, to visit his mother for Thanksgiving.Jenna Bouffard, a New York City public relations executive headed in the opposite direction, changed her bus ticket from Wednesday to Tuesday."I don't want to risk it," she said. "I'd rather be safe than sorry, and if it doesn't snow, then I just have an extra day at home with my family" in Uxbridge, Massachusetts.Major airlines dropped their ticket-change fees for people flying in and out of the Northeast, allowing passengers to try to sneak on an earlier flight, though that appeared to be a challenging proposition, since most planes were filled.By midafternoon Tuesday, just 14 flights within the U.S. were canceled for Wednesday, according to tracking service FlightAware. That's well below the norm for even a sunny day. United said it was planning to cancel 100 flights Wednesday in and out of Newark Liberty Airport in New Jersey - a small fraction of the traffic there. Delta planned to scrub 57 flights.The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark Liberty airports, said it was lining up extra staff and snow removal equipment in the event of a heavy snowfall. Crews were prepared to work in 12-hour shifts if necessary, officials said.At Newark Airport, retiree Sue Hansen, who lives in Roscoe, Illinois, arrived early on Tuesday to avoid the rush ahead of a big family reunion near Morristown, New Jersey."I've traveled the day before, and it was no good," she said, describing long lines, delays and lots of crowds. "This wasn't bad at all."In Vermont, public safety officials warned that travel could be treacherous. Up to 16 inches of snow was forecast in some areas.There was a bright spot in the forecast for residents of western New York, which last week saw up to 7 feet of snow."Buffalo will predominantly miss this event," Orrison said.---Associated Press Writers Jill Colvin in Newark, N.J., Denise Lavoie in Boston, and Scott Mayerowitz and Karen Matthews in New York contributed to this report.See more crazy snow from this season:
http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2014/12/09/apple-releases-ios-8-1-2/?partner=yahootix	Apple Releases iOS 8.1.2, It Will Anger Users	Without any warning Apple Apple has today released iOS 8.1.2 for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch users running iOS 8. But it isn’t the long awaited raft of bug fixes needed for users affected by the ongoing problems with iOS 8.Instead the release “addresses a problem where ringtones purchases through the iTunes Store may have been removed from your device.” Apple notes a dedicated url – itunes.com/restore-tones – has been setup for recovering those ringtones.Apple does also state that iOS 8.1.2 has “bug fixes” but the URL it provides has no information on the release at the time of writing and Apple always calls out more significant bug fixes in its main release notes. Furthermore iOS 8.1.2 comes in at a paltry 28.2MB (this may differ slightly from device-to-device) making it a minor point release.Read more – iPhone 6 And iPhone 6 Plus vs iPhone 5S And iPhone 5: Should You Upgrade?As such iOS 8.1.2 isn’t the major fix users still plagued by ongoing iOS 8 problems have been hoping for. iOS 8.1.1 released in November fixed bugs for many users, but swathes of users remain affected by issues ranging from crippled WiFi (a main support thread for this is now over 93 pages long), Bluetooth bugs stopping connection to headsets and car kits and chronic battery drain. In this context Apple’s decision to address a ringtones bug first will no doubt cause anger, regardless of whether it is low hanging fruit.iOS 8.2 To The Rescue, EventuallyHopes were raised when Apple seeded ‘iOS 8.2 (Beta 1)’ in the iOS Dev Center at the same time that it releases iOS 8.1.1. The main new feature listed for this is the addition of the ‘WatchKit’ API for the Apple Watch, but the more significant version number suggests it should be a more wide-ranging update. The problem is iOS 8.2 is not expected to be released before spring 2015.iOS 8 vs Android 5.0 LollipopiOS 8 has had a troubled start to life with undoubted highs and lows (including pulling the iOS 8.0.1 update completely), but there is no doubt that once Apple eventually eliminates the core bugs it is the most exciting and open version of iOS to date with the launch of Apple Pay, HealthKit, far better integration between apps and the introduction of third party keyboards.Read more – iOS 8: The Best Keyboard ReplacementsThat said the common complaint across Apple Support Forums is far more basic. It comes from affected users who want better communication from Apple about how and when the current bugs in iOS 8 will be addressed. The company’s silence prior to surprise release of iOS 8.1.2 and the fact is focuses on a ringtone glitch when some are struggling with the core usability of their devices is only likely to stoke this frustration.As always my advice to affected users is to download the update and share their experiences, but for those currently without problems I’d suggest holding fire until the wider reaction is known.Users will be prompted to update to iOS 8.1.2 automatically over the next 24/48 hours, but if you would like to manually check for the update go to: Settings>General>Software Update. As always, you must have at least 50% battery capacity before it will install. __ Follow @GordonKellyGordon Kelly is an experienced freelance technology journalist who has written for Wired, The Next Web, TrustedReviews and the BBC.

(Kenneth Willardt Studio)  You might not know it, but you’ve been staring through Kenneth Willardt’s lens for decades. This is, after all,  the man who shoots magazine covers with Miranda Kerr, L’Oreal campaigns with Freida Pinto, and all the Maybelline ads, too. (Maybe she’s born with it…maybe it’s a killer photographer?)Now the Danish transplant launches his newest project, The Beauty Book, at 558 Gallery in New York City. An interactive experience, The Beauty Book ($125, teNeues) lets you view the images—plus behind-the-scenes info and bonus photos—through your smartphone. We spoke with the photographer about his new work, his celebrity clients, and why he needs to shoot more naked men.Yahoo Style: This book is like a catalog of your best work. But how did you start?Kenneth Willardt: I was six. My brother and I had suntans, and we were standing in our bathroom, and the tile was this turquoise color. I loved the way it contrasted with the texture and color of our skin. I said, “Dad, we should take a picture of this!” And my dad got his camera, and he gave it to me, and that’s how it started. From that day, I was hooked. I started apprenticing in Denmark when I was 16, I moved to New York at 20, and by 24, I’d set up my own photography business.YS: What’s the secret to being young and successful?KW: Hard work! I was very, very organized. I still am. When I shoot on-set, it’s very fast. I have a great team of assistants, stylists, makeup artists, and we go into every shoot prepared. I think that’s why people like to shoot with me, because we’re so organized and we go quickly, and we’re always calm. You hear these nightmare stories about crazy people on shoots—that’s not us. I guess it’s the Scandinavian in me.YS: You shoot Maybelline and L’Oreal. What makeup looks do you like most on camera?KW: I either like very soft, dewy skin with nude pink lipstick, or a smoky, dramatic eye with a glossy red lip. Either of those are great. The more intense the smoky eye, the better.YS: Can you give us tips for taking the perfect selfie?KW: That’s interesting.YS: Oh no. Do you hate selfies?KW: No, not at all. I understand it’s what people want to know about, I understand the fascination. I really admire the people who are very, very good at it. What I would say, and it’s completely true, is that make sure you only take the selfie when you feel good. Don’t just look good—feel good. You can always tell when someone feels great, and it really does make the photo more beautiful.YS: The Beauty Book features some gorgeous shots of naked women. But why are there no naked men?!KW: That’s a good question. I have no answer for you, except to say that I’m working on another book right now, and I’m going to make sure to shoot some naked men for you. I will keep that in my mind and really think about how to do that. YS: So now we have to ask… what’s it like working with Jennifer Lopez?KW: Do you know I was supposed to shoot Jennifer Lopez today for L’Oreal, and I told her I couldn’t!YS: You blew off J-Lo?!KW: I had to say no! It was yesterday and today, and today I’ve been at the gallery because all of my photos are going up, and the book is launching… I couldn’t bail on my own team, and my own book. So I apologized and said I would love to, but I just can’t.
http://www.businessinsider.com/giannis-antetokounmpo-developing-2014-12	19-Year-Old 'Greek Freak' Is Doing Things That Should Terrify The Rest Of The NBA	Alex Goddlett/Getty ImagesGiannis Antetokounmpo is just 19 years old but already turning heads in the NBA.Only a handful of NBA players have as much potential as Giannis Antetokounmpo, the so-called Greek Freak who's having a breakout year for the Milwaukee Bucks.Antetokounmpo is just 19 years old. He's 6'11" with a 7'3" wingspan. Hardcore NBA followers have been watching him since he came into the league in 2013, and it's only a matter of time before mainstream fans catch on to what he can do.His ascent isn't going to be as smooth or immediate as that of Anthony Davis. He didn't attend college in the US and had little experience playing against the best teams in Europe when the Bucks drafted him straight out of Greece in 2013.As noted in his DraftExpress profile, Antetokounmpo is a "late bloomer who did not have the benefit of growing up playing against other top international talents." He has considerable physical gifts, but will have to adjust to the talent of the NBA while learning not to dominate the ball like he did in Greece.However, his game is coming along nicely and perhaps more quickly than expected. This season, his averages of 11.9 points on 48% shooting, 5.9 rebounds, and 1.9 assists per game are all higher than his rookie averages. They're not superstar numbers, but they're impressive improvements for a guy who's still leaning how to play the game.Even more exciting is the way he's combining his physical advantages with his unique skill set. To put it simply, he can do things on a basketball court that no one else in the NBA can do because of his length and athleticism. He has the height and wingspan of a center, but he also has skills off the dribble.Here he is Euro-stepping from the THREE-POINT LINE for a layup:Other times, he Euro-steps, plants, and dunks in his defenders' faces: He can get to the rim in two dribbles and elevate quickly: And he can start a play on one end and finish it on the other:That Antetokounmpo now seems fully in control of his physical gifts makes him terrifying for the opposition. Though he still has several areas to improve upon — he's only shooting 15% from three, and his steals and blocks are both below one per game — he's beginning to harness all of his skills.Bucks center Larry Sanders reflected on Antetokounmpo, saying, "He's only just scratching the surface of how good he's going to be. He's just tapping into new abilities and trying on new things. He's really learning about himself and it's amazing to watch."He also has head coach Jason Kidd's confidence. Over the summer, Kidd made the decision to give Antetokounmpo the ball to run the offense: "We've seen it in practice. When you see a player's comfort level with the ball — no matter what size — we wanted to see it in game action. We slowly have started letting him have the ball and running the offense."Kidd even referenced from Hall of Famers when talking about Antetokounmpo:"A 19-year-old to a 30-year-old is a little different in understanding [to slow the game down]. But that's what this time of the year is for, to understand Magic (Johnson) wasn't fast. Grant Hill had a quick first step, but he was a point forward. Scottie Pippen could play multiple positions."It may be a little early to put Antetokounmpo next to Scottie Pippen and Magic Johnson, but the potential and possibilities of what he may blossom into are endless.
http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2014/12/07/on-economy-russia-shoots-self-in-foot/?partner=yahootix	On Economy, Russia Shoots Self In Foot	For years, the Russian leadership has been touting its planned divergence away from commodities. Gone were the days when Russian was just Gazprom and Mechel. Instead, Russia — the country that brought you the Soyuz rocket family — was going to build a mini-Frankfurt in Moscow and a mini-Silicon Valley in Skolkovo in 2010.Fast forward four years and the ruble is looking worse than it has in 14 years, Russian natural gas giant Gazprom is now worth just 3.2 times earnings, and new Moscow City looks vacant. Even the most aggressive, value hunting money manager is afraid of investing in Russia.The economy is expected to fall into a recession next year. The Western powers have sanctioned Russia’s biggest energy companies and banks for its actions in eastern Ukraine. And now Vladimir Putin is blaming those powers for his problems; problems that Russia should have dealt with a decade ago when Dmitry Medvedev, then president of the country, promised to diversify the Russian economy.Putin is blaming the West for Russia’s economic problems. But sanctions serve to amplify the fact that Russia’s economy is too dependent on oil and gas.Russia is therefore being punished for its involvement in Ukraine and its inability to promote a middle market and Russian entrepreneurship. Capital flight might be the least of Russia’s problems. A brain drain is even worse. The guys who help keep the International Space Station orbiting the earth at more than 17,000 miles per hour are living in a world barely surviving on raw materials.“Why can’t we make a company like Huawei in Russia?” asked German Gref, the outspoken CEO of Sberbank. Huawei is considered the Cisco Systems of China. Gref said this during an address at the annual Russia Calling conference in Moscow in October. “We have a governance problem in Russia and until that is dealt with, nothing will be fixed,” he said, surprisingly frank for a government employee.Even Russia’s major energy infrastructure projects, its biggest connection to Europe, are on hold now because of Ukraine. This month, the South Stream gas pipeline project was canceled. Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said Saturday that they had no plans to revive it. Further north, in the Kara Sea in the Russian Arctic, ExxonMobil and Rosneft are busy twiddling their thumbs over a $700+ million joint venture to drill for hydrocarbons there. Washington sanctions have banned Exxon from drilling with Rosneft.Russia may be overpowering Ukraine, having taken over the Crimean peninsula in the Black Sea and well on its way to convincing eastern provinces to become autonomous anti-Kiev zones. But despite the gains in real estate, Russia is losing in every other way.Next

Where to View the Most Spectacular Meteor Shower	Two Perseid meteors streak across the Milky Way during the 2012 meteor shower in Oklahoma. (Photo: John Davis/Stocktrek Images/Corbis)Astronomy nerds, rejoice! The Perseid meteor shower is peaking tonight (Aug. 12), and there are favorable viewing conditions across different parts of the United States.Thanks Mother Nature!If you are in an area with a clear and dark sky (out of the way of city lights), you should be able to see as many as 60 to100 meteors in a single hour after midnight. (And if tonight doesn’t work out, no worries: the meteor shower will continue through August 24.)A meteor streaks across the sky over the Mojave Desert in Landers, Calif., on Aug. 12, 2013. The Perseid meteor shower occurs every August when Earth passes through the debris and dust of Comet Swift-Tuttle. (Photo: Paul Buck/epa/Corbis)The best viewing conditions for this year’s Perseid shower will be in Northern California, the Great Lakes region, the Plains states, and the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, according to AccuWeather meteorologist Jordan Root. The Perseids are one of the most well-known meteor showers. They were first documented more than 2,000 years ago. The name Perseids comes from the constellation Perseus. The meteors appear to burst out of the warrior constellation, but in reality the shower is caused by Earth passing through a dust trail caused by the Comet Swift-Tuttle. Not sure where Perseus is in the night sky? You can easily locate the constellation with the help of stargazing apps like Star Chart and SkyView.If you want wildly specific viewing-time information for your state, look no further than the Spacedex website, an incredible resource for all things sky related.And while we’re talking about stargazing (we can talk about it all day), here are some other spectacular meteor showers you need to get on your calendar.The Quadrantid meteor shower seen in Wales on Jan. 3, 2014. (Photo: Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/Flickr)Quadrantids: This is a pretty sweet way to usher in the new year, if you know where to look. The Quadrantids are typically the first major meteor shower of the year. They’re most visible from Dec. 28 through Jan. 12, typically peaking on the morning of Jan. 3. This shower can be seen only in the Northern Hemisphere. The higher the latitude, the better the show.Related: 15 Incredible Photos That Will Remind You to Be Awed by Planet EarthA meteor from the Lyrid meteor shower streaks through the sky above a barn near Oakland, Ore. on April 21, 2012.

They are typically active in mid-April and best viewed in the Northern Hemisphere. Looking east will provide you with the best gazing.The Lyrids are often less fruitful than the Perseids or Quadrantids, with only about 10 to 20 meteors per hour during peak viewing times. They appear to burst out of the constellation Lyra, which contains the star Vega, one of the brightest in the night sky, making them easy to pinpoint with a stargazing app.Two meteors from the 2011 Orionids meteor shower, seen from the Mercedes Observatory in Buenos Aires on Oct. 24, 2011.

It usually takes place for about a week in late October. The meteors can appear at a rate of 50 to 70 an hour and are also best viewed in the Northern Hemisphere.

(Photo: Dirk Essl/Flickr)Geminids: Often referred to as “winter’s fireworks,” the Geminids are one of the most impressive meteor showers of the year. Often active during the first two weeks of December, they are particularly spectacular because they are multicolored — shining bright in yellow, green, blue, and even red. The Geminids appear to originate from the bright stars within the Gemini constellation, Castor and Pollux. Gemini often rises quite early (hitting the eastern horizon around 9 p.m.), which means you can view this show much earlier in the evening than many of its counterparts which make you sit around and gaze at the sky from midnight until dawn.Let Yahoo Travel inspire you every day.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) does not back raising the minimum wage. (AP Photo/Timothy D. Easley)WASHINGTON -- Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) doesn't deny that he's rich. But what stuck in his craw Monday night was his Democratic opponent's insinuation that he had earned his wealth using his position as senator. An outraged McConnell clarified for debate viewers how he became a millionaire: He and his wife inherited the money.The pointed exchange between McConnell and Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes (D) came when moderator Bill Goodman, host of the program "Kentucky Tonight," asked the two candidates whether they believe the current minimum wage ($7.25 an hour) is a living wage.McConnell replied that the "minimum wage is largely an entry-level wage." He argued that raising it to $10.10 an hour -- as many Democrats would like -- would lead to "destroying jobs for young people." (In fact, according to the Economic Policy Institute, 88 percent of workers who would benefit from a higher minimum wage are older than 20.)Grimes, however, said the country needed to "increase the minimum wage so that it is a living wage. $7.25 an hour does not allow a family of four to actually rise above poverty level."She then blasted McConnell for not caring about the interests of low-income residents of the state: "He's gotten rich while consistently voting to keep Kentucky poor, and we can't have a senator like that any longer."McConnell then jumped in to defend his honor:McCONNELL: I can't let that stand. She's been given four Pinocchios for that as well. GRIMES: So you're not a multimillionaire? McCONNELL: To claim that I got rich at public expense -- she knows that that's a result of an inheritance that my wife got when her mother passed away. And she's consistently gone around, Bill, all over the state, and suggested that I've somehow enriched myself at public expense. Let me tell you, her family has made more money off the government in the last 10 years than I've been paid in a salary in all my time in the Senate. That is an outrageous suggestion. She knows it's wrong. She's been given four Pinocchios repeatedly for continuing to say that.While most politicians try to play down their wealth by stressing that they're just like the average, working-class voter -- whether it's by driving around in an old truck, chowing down on fast food or lamenting that they were "dead broke" after leaving the White House -- McConnell seems to have taken a different tack Monday night. He didn't try to shy away from his wealth, but said he wanted to set the record straight on its origins.According to Roll Call, McConnell ranks 32nd on a list of the richest members of Congress, worth $11.97 million.While Grimes was right that McConnell has voted against minimum wage increases, she has been dinged -- as McConnell pointed out -- by The Washington Post and its "Pinocchios" system for her insinuation that he used his public position to make millions. More from Roll Call on McConnell's wealth:The Kentucky Republican’s reportable assets nearly tripled in 2008 thanks to a $5 million gift that he and his wife, former Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao, received from her father, James, soon after the death of her mother. (After emigrating in the 1960s, the senator’s father-in-law founded a successful international trading business, now called the Foremost Group, specializing in importing Chinese-made goods to the United States.) The money has been invested ever since in a tax-exempt money market fund that remains the McConnells’ most significant asset by far.HuffPost Pollster, which averages the publicly available polling in race, shows McConnell leading Grimes by 4 points.What's happening in your district?

http://screen.yahoo.com/alaska-storm-likely-becomes-strongest-143702887.html	Alaska Storm Likely Becomes Strongest in Bering Sea History	0:30WochitA massive storm in the Bering Sea, off the western Alaska coast and to the east of Russia, strengthened enough to be considered the strongest storm that the turbulent region has ever seen. It may not be an official record, however, as the minimum central pressure of 924 millibars was estimated by meteorologists, since the storm is over the open ocean off the Kamchatka Peninsula.An astonishingly tragic year for air travel in Southeast Asia turned worse Sunday when an AirAsia plane carrying 162 people disappeared over stormy Indonesian waters, with no word on its fate despite several hours of searching by air and sea. AirAsia Flight 8501 vanished in airspace possibly thick with dense storm clouds, strong winds and lightning on its way from Surabaya, Indonesia, to Singapore. Searchers had to fight against heavy rain. The Malaysia-based carrier&#39;s loss comes on top of the still-unexplained disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in March and the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in July over Ukraine. At the Surabaya airport, shocked family members pored over the plane&#39;s manifest, crying and embracing when they learned the news. Nearly all the passengers and crew are Indonesians, who are frequent visitors to Singapore, particularly on holidays.0:37WochitColorado&#39;s 9News reports that Puddle of Mudd frontman Wes Scantlin was arrested last week at the Denver airport after embracing his inner child riding a baggage carousel. According to a report from the Denver police, Scantlin — in flagrant disregard for signs reading &quot;keep out&quot; and &quot;do not ride the carousel&quot; was seen running behind the carousel and coming &quot;out of the secured area through an alarmed door.&quot; Scantlin was apprehended by police and taken to jail.1:06WochitAccording to a newly released report on a statistical model from the federal government, safety technology—including airbags, seatbelts, crash structures, and much more, has saved an estimated 613,501 lives since 1960. On the heels of that comes an announcement from Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx today, underscoring the importance of progress in safety-technology features. Foxx revealed that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration plans to add both crash-imminent braking and dynamic brake support to its list of ‘recommended’ advanced safety features. Both are part of what the federal agency terms automatic emergency braking systems, systems that can intevene and automatically apply the brakes or add to braking effort in order to anticipate an imminent collision and either lessen its severity or avoid it entirely.0:36WochitOne of Renee Zellweger&#39;s most recent pictures features one of America&#39;s favorite leading ladies having coffee with a friend in Santa Monica. And she&#39;s not wearing a stitch of makeup, which makes it a whole lot easier to discern whether or not she got all the surgeries that were speculated about. Fishwrapper thinks she looks great -- but still pretty dang different. So, what do you think? Plastic surgery--did she do it, or didn&#39;t she?1:06WochitAnthony Mackie did his best to steal the show from Chris Evans in last summer’s Captain America: The Winter Soldier, playing the charming, funny and high-flying Sam Wilson, A.K.A. the Falcon. Although he’s set to return in 2016’s Captain America: Civil War, Mackie’s open to making many more Marvel appearances. Many, many more. Asked if he’ll cameo in this year’s Avengers: Age of Ultron, Mackie told IAmRogue.com, “I hope. At this point, I have not. I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope. They’re doing reshoots and that’s why I’m letting them know I’m available. So whatever weekend they want me there, I’ll fly myself out and shoot whatever scene they want me in. Even if it’s like, ‘Oh man! It’s Iron Man and Hulk.’” Captain America: Civil War will be released May 6, 2016.
http://www.inquisitr.com/1710561/prince-harry-an-inconvenient-truth-about-who-his-father-might-be/	Prince Harry: An ‘Inconvenient Truth’ About Who His Father Might Be	The identity of Prince Harry’s father was one of many rumors that circulated around Princess Diana during her lifetime. This was because she was having an affair with cavalry officer James Hewitt about a year before Harry was born.The allegation has been given new life, after Hewitt supported a controversial new West End play suggesting that he could indeed be Prince Harry’s father. The Mail on Sunday reports that Hewitt has permitted himself to be portrayed in the production Truth, Lies, Diana, which contains many revelations about his relationship with the princess.The play is based on interviews with people close to Diana, including Hewitt himself and her former butler, Paul Burrell.In one scene, Hewitt reveals to a reporter, “Diana and I started our relationship more than a year before Harry was born. Now that doesn’t prove that I am his father. It’s just the… inconvenient truth.”Jon Conway, the author of the play — due to open in London on January 9 for a short season — spoke with Hewitt about his relationship with Diana. Hewitt agreed that the play would be an accurate reflection of that relationship.“I have been talking to James over a period of two years. I met him and he told me some quite remarkable things that have never been said in the public domain, particularly about when his relationship with Diana started. There is a startling revelation that James Hewitt makes and he has allowed me to make it in the play. This is the fact that his relationship with Diana started 18 months before Prince Harry was born. We are not saying he is Prince Harry’s father although the audience may take their own view on that. I don’t know if James Hewitt is Prince Harry’s father and James Hewitt has always denied it either because it isn’t true or out of some sense of loyalty.”Royal commentators rubbished the play, calling it “a nonsense.” But Conway claimed that all the revelations in the play were either taken from official documents or were based on interviews with key figures from Diana’s life.Also, publicist Max Clifford claimed in a biography that Hewitt had told him that the relationship predated Prince Harry’s birth.Now, James Hewitt is refusing to confirm when his relationship with Diana began, and would not be drawn on the issue of Prince Harry’s parentage.He said, “I wish this subject would go away. It’s never going to and that’s just the way of life.”Presumably, a DNA test would solve the problem once and for all, but it is highly improbable that Prince Harry would ever agree.Unsurprisingly, a spokesman for Clarence House last night refused to comment.
https://www.yahoo.com/style/7-signs-the-guy-you-love-with-is-toxic-106615107648.html	7 Signs the Guy You Love is Toxic	Photo Credit: iStockBy Jenna BirchWe’ve all met a toxic man. In fact, you’ve probably met a whole lot of them. And spent time with them. And dated them. And got all mired in relationships with them. And the real kicker? You probably didn’t even realized that dude you were dating was a manipulative, lying, super-clingy control freak. "So many women are worried about hurting a man’s feelings," says Dr. Lillian Glass, author of the book, Toxic Men: 10 Ways to Identify, Deal with, and Heal from the Men Who Make Your Life Miserable. “They forget to worry about themselves and their own emotional needs. A lot of woman are being abused and they don’t even know it.” Related: Why ‘Complicated’ Women Attract The Best MenI don’t want you to be a woman ensnared by a toxic man (or woman—this book is for anyone, people), just because you didn’t realize he was toxic. If in doubt, here are seven signs you might be dealing with a toxic man. If the guy you’re with sounds like the guy below, then heed the warnings—and get rid of him. 1. He sounds too good to be true.Yeah, he is most likely a toxic man. We’ve all been hurt before, but a lot of women will start to retreat to a vulnerable place in their love lives when it happens, making them especially susceptible to toxic men. These guys seem to sweep you off your feet for a whirlwind romance. Be careful, though. Does he say he’s ultra-protective because he loves you so much? Does he bring you gifts to smooth over his unsettling behavior? Does he seem to say whatever you want to hear, all the time? This dude could very well be one of Dr. Glass’s eleven types of toxic men, ranging from the Jealous Competitor, to the Seductive Manipulating Cheating Liar, to the Socio-Psychopath. Watch. Out.2. He tells you he is a jerk, a bad boy, or buried in debt.If a man tells you he is a certain way, just believe him. Don’t try to convince him, or yourself, that he is in fact different from what he’s telling you. He’s not trying to be complicated, or waiting to reveal more glowing facts about himself at a later date. All you need to know is in the words he’s sharing. 3. You’re already a toxic-man magnet.If you think you can change a bad boy, find that you often feel sorry for the men you date, believe love conquers all, or have made up your mind that Mr. Right will look just like Prince Charming, you’re a toxic-man magnet. Make sure your thoughts about relationships are realistic, because toxic dudes will prey on those who may have an idealistic approach to love.4. You notice something, or he says something, that puts you off.Let’s say the man you’re with makes an unguarded remark that seems… just plain wrong. Your red-flag sirens should be blaring wildly, so you need to dig deeper. Forget asking surface questions that will not get to the bottom of the situation. Ask questions to prod him toward more revealing answers. The book suggests things like, “Excuse me, I didn’t quite catch what you said,” or, “What exactly do you mean by that?” If his answer is something that seems bizarre, say so. Just don’t say that you’re the one who thinks it, to take the judgment factor out of it: “I know someone who would really question that,” or, “What do you say if someone tells you they find that hard to believe?” These conversations should give you tons of insight into your presumably (very) toxic man. Related: Do You Have The 10 Qualities Men Look For In A Girlfriend?5. He exhibits strange speech patterns.Backhanded compliments. Insulting you, and then saying, “Just kidding!” Talking like he’s in a high-speed chase. Repeating part of your sentence before he answers a question, as if he needs time to manufacture an excuse. A monotone voice. All these speech patterns are indicative of a toxic man. If you hear any of them, beware.6. You’re beautiful, smart, talented, young, a mother, a teacher.No one is immune to a toxic man. No woman is too brilliant, too beautiful, too kind or too amazing to avoid these guys if she doesn’t know the warning signs. Are you a talented pianist? A toxic man will never appreciate you. A genius doctor? A toxic man will not respect you. A kindergarten teacher? Be careful you don’t take a toxic man under your wing, because you love to shape lives. Lesson: Don’t think it can’t happen to you. It can. 7. Your appearance has changed.When you’re dealing with a toxic man, you’re storing negative emotions up inside you—but they don’t stay inside forever. Think about someone who upsets you for a minute, and then look in the mirror. What do you see? Pursed lips? A rigid stance? A furrowed brow? You’ll begin to appear this way if your relationship is turning into a nightmare. If friends start saying, “Are you okay? You seem upset,” on a regular basis, you may want to check your man situation.’More from YourTango: The 7 Ridiculous Types Of Guys You Meet Online 5 Types Of Guys Who Are NOT Husband Material 4 Tell-Tale Signs You’re In Love With An A**Hole
http://gma.yahoo.com/oklahoma-woman-parts-both-legs-arms-amputated-tick-195813924--abc-news-health.html	Oklahoma Woman Get Parts of Both Legs, Arms Amputated After Tick Bite Infection	A 40-year-old woman from Shawnee, Oklahoma, recently had to get major parts of both arms and both legs amputated due to a serious infection from an unnoticed tick bite after a vacation, according to her husband and hospital staff.The patient, Jo Rogers, is currently in the intensive care unit of Integris' Baptist Medical Center in Oklahoma City, where she is being treated for complications stemming from Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF), her husband, Keith Rogers, told ABC News Friday.RMSF is a potentially fatal tick-borne disease caused by the bacterium Rickettsia rickettsii, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."After things started going bad and she went into septic shock, the blood flow cut off to her limbs, and her hands and feet started going black," her husband said. "So, two weeks ago, they had to cut off her right leg just above the knee, her left leg just below the knee and both her arms about mid-forearm."Girl Dies After Tick Bite InfectionHow to Avoid and Treat Tick BitesLyme Disease Cited in Connection to Woman's Erratic Behavior at Waldorf-AstoriaKeith Rogers said that he visits his wife every day at the hospital as she battles other complications from RMSF, including blood clots in her lungs that necessitated a tracheotomy last Friday."Every day is a new challenge," he said. "I go in there, sit and talk to her and show her pictures of how our two boys are doing. I show her videos of her two dogs back at home. I try to keep it normal, but it gets very hard because she'll want me not to leave, and it's so hard because I can't take her with me."Though Jo Rogers currently can't speak or walk, her husband wants people to know she is a fun-loving woman who loved her dogs, hiking and nature.The couple went hiking at Natural Falls State Park, close to the Oklahoma-Arkansas border, this past Fourth of July, he said, explaining that there weren't many waterfalls in Oklahoma and she wanted to go see one.View gallery Oklahoma Woman Get Parts of Both Legs, Arms Amputated After Tick Bite Infection (ABC News)"But when we came back, she started feeling sick, and she thought she might have the flu," Keith Rogers said, noting that headaches turned into fevers that then became aggravated with vomiting and dizziness.Though his wife initially resisted going to the hospital, she was so lethargic a week later that "she wasn't making any sense," Keith Rogers said, so he took her to the emergency room.As her health deteriorated, doctors did rounds of tests on her, including tests for meningitis and West Nile Virus, but they only figured out she had complications from a tick-borne illness when she was already developing gangrene on her limbs, he said."We're not sure if she was bit by the tick when we were hiking at the falls or if it was at home," he said. "I don't think it's really set in with my family yet, but for me, it's up and down every day."Keith Rogers said he's not sure if his wife will be in the hospital for a few more months or a year, but once she's fully recovered, he said she'll likely transition to rehab and that the family would take it from there.A GoFundMe page to help cover the costs of Jo's medical care has been set up by her cousin, he added."RMSF is the most commonly reported tick-borne illness in Oklahoma," according to the state Health Department. "In addition, Oklahoma has one of the highest rates of RMSF in the United States."A spokesperson for Integris' Baptist Medical Center told ABC News that Jo Rogers' physician declined to be interviewed but confirmed she was currently at the hospital being treated for RMSF and that she has had amputations.Dr. Jennifer Ashton, a senior medical contributor for ABC News, said RMSF is s currently in peak tick season."It's been reported in urban areas and even found in people who have not been camping," she said.The symptoms -- fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and rash -- can mimic a lot of viruses, she said."If there is a suspicion that these symptoms could be related to a tick bite, the recommendation is to start doxycycline antibiotics immediately because time is of the essence," said Ashton.
http://www.usatoday.com/story/gameon/2013/02/21/oscar-pistorius-shocking-10-things/1935791/	The 10 most shocking facts of Oscar Pistorius' murder case	Oscar Pistorius/APThe Oscar Pistorius saga took another bizarre turn on Thursday. USA TODAY Sports looks back at the first week of the ongoing case and picked the 10 most shocking facts yet.1. The killing. The most important facts of the case are not in doubt: Early on Valentine's Day morning, Oscar Pistorius, the double-amputee Olympian who is arguably South Africa's biggest sporting star, shot through a bathroom door at his home in Pretoria and killed his girlfriend, 29-year-old model and law school graduate Reeva Steenkamp. Was it cold-blooded murder, as police claim, or did Pistorius think he was shooting at an intruder? Lawyers will argue, a verdict will be reached and observers around the world will debate, but only one man knows the answer, and he's sitting in a holding cell, awaiting word on whether he'll go free before South Africa's trial of the century.2. The lead detective charged with seven attempted murders. Detective Hilton Botha dealt a blow to the prosecution on Wednesday after he was forced to admit shoddy police work upon defense cross-examination. (See No. 3.) That was nothing compared to Thursday's bombshell. It was revealed that Botha is facing seven attempted murder charges stemming from a 2011 incident in which he and two other officers shot at a minivan. Reports say the men were chasing down a murder suspect. The charges had been dropped but were reinstated 10 days before Steenkamp's death.The National Prosecuting Authority said Botha's past is "completely unrelated" to the trial. Barry Roux, a defense lawyer for Pistorius, disagrees. Though the 2011 incident certainly had no bearing on the Feb. 14 events at the home of Pistorius, it may cloud the trial. Observers were quick to point out how questions about the integrity of Detective Mark Fuhrman possibly swayed the O.J. Simpson jury to acquit the former football star of double murder.Botha was replaced as lead detective on Thursday.Former lead detective Hilton Brotha/AFP3. Police blunders. Botha initially said the two witnesses who heard screaming from Pistorius' house on the night of the killing were 600 meters away. He later changed the distance to 300 meters. Other admissions: Investigators missed a spent bullet in the toilet and didn't take pictures of a box of bullets but snapped photos of Pistorius' medals.4. Was he wearing his prosthetic legs? Pistorius says he walked to the bathroom on his stumps, then shot through the door. Botha said the angle of the bullet holes suggest Pistorius was standing tall on his prosthetics. The police theory gives credence to a charge of premeditation. If Pistorius had time to put on his prosthetics, they'll argue, then he wasn't getting out of bed quickly to pursue an intruder.Complicating the issue is Botha's later admission that police found no inconsistencies in Pistorius' account of events. Which is it? Do the angles of the bullet trajectories contradict Pistorius' statement or don't they?Pistorius stands before the court/AP5. The empty bladder debate. An autopsy revealed Steenkamp's bladder was empty when she was killed. Since it would be highly unlikely for a person's bladder to be fully empty at 3 a.m., the defense says this shows Steenkamp was using the bathroom before the killing. The theory floated: She locked herself inside after hearing Pistorius yelling at an intruder.6. Bloody cricket bat. "Was Steenkamp's skull crushed with bloodied cricket bat 'found' at Pistorius's house?" blared a headline in the Daily Mail after reports emerged that police were considering a theory that Pistorius beat Steenkamp to death. That scenario has since been dismissed. Pistorius said he used the bat to break down the bathroom door, and police have not suggested otherwise.7. Pistorius' confidence. A front page article in The Times (of South Africa) quoted a police officer who said he had contact with Pistorius after Wednesday's hearings. "He's convinced he'll be out by the weekend and back on the track before the end of the year," the officer said. Would an innocent man be that confident? Could a guilty man be that delusional? If that quote is accurate, psychologists could have a field day dissecting it.8. Drugs? Botha said police found two boxes of testosterone, syringes and needles in a bedroom cabinet. Later, a police spokesman admitted the contents of the box were unknown. Testosterone is a banned substance by the IOC. The defense says the boxes contained an herbal remedy commonly used for sexual enhancement purposes.9. The gun on the nightstand. On its Thursday front page, the New York Daily News ran a 2010 photograph of a bedside table at Pistorius' house. Scattered among the routine items like car keys and a remote control is a Taurus hand gun.10. Media circus overshadows all. While the world is transfixed by the drama in a Pretoria courtroom, it's easy to lose sight of the tragedy of a woman dying young and the family that's left to pick up the pieces.A relative of the late South African model Reeva Steenkamp holds the funeral ceremony program/AFP
http://diffuser.fm/arlo-guthrie-alices-restaurant-thanksgiving/	Arlo Guthrie's 'Alice's Restaurant': Thanksgiving's Go-To Song	New Year’s has ‘Auld Lang Syne.’Christmas has — well, Christmas has lots of songs.But when it comes to Thanksgiving, there’s only one song that will do, trotted out annually like that enormous turkey platter that your grandmother loves so much:“You can get anything you want / At Alice’s Restaurant ...”The funny thing? It’s not really a song, and it isn’t about Thanksgiving.‘Alice’s Restaurant,’ or more accurately, ‘Alice’s Restaurant Massacree,’ is a 1967 monologue by then 20-year-old Arlo Guthrie, son of folk legend Woody Guthrie. Accompanying Guthrie’s long-winded tale is a pretty little Piedmont blues riff repeated for 18 minutes and 34 seconds. What would serve as the chorus in a conventional song — the “You can get anything you want” refrain — bookends the story.And what a story it is. In 1965, Guthrie paid a Thanksgiving visit to his friends, Alice and Ray Brock, at their home in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. The Brocks lived in an old church, and Alice ran a little restaurant nearby. The restaurant is still there, but Alice no longer owns it. She’s still around, though.The church is still around, too, but since 1991 it’s been the Guthrie Center, “an environment where individuals can come together to cultivate a deeper awareness of culture, humanity and the environment of which we are all a part.”Anyway, while visiting the Brocks, Guthrie and another friend volunteered to do a garbage run. Unfortunately, the town dump was closed for Thanksgiving, so the two opted for the very un-hippie-like alternative of illegally chucking the garbage at a spot used by many locals.The boys were caught by a police officer named William Obanhein, or Obie as he is known in the song. Obanhein arrested Guthrie and his friend and photographed the crime scene. Obie’s photos proved fairly useless in court, though, as the judge was blind. The two young men were fined 50 bucks and told to go clean up their mess.During the mid-’60s, the draft was on, and kids Guthrie’s age were being shipped to Vietnam as quickly as the induction centers could process them. Draftees had to pass a battery of tests, both physical and psychological, and when Guthrie’s number was called he sailed through without any problems.But there was another criterion: morality. At that time, the armed services didn’t want any recruits who had been convicted of a crime. That’s right: Arlo Guthrie escaped the draft because he littered.These episodes — both the original arrest and the absurdity of his later draft experience — inspired Guthrie to write ‘Alice’s Restaurant,’ part true story, part tall tale. Regarding the length of the piece, the singer recently told Rolling Stone that Bill Cosby inspired him:One of the first people that I heard tell stories of that length was Bill Cosby. I remember seeing him at the Gaslight and hearing him tell these old tales. I remember wanting him to tell the same story every night I went. I learned what it was like from an audience point of view to want to hear the same stuff, even if I didn’t want to repeat myself.Back in 2005, Guthrie told NPR’s ‘All Things Considered‘ that he began working on the story/song the night after the arrest, and that it took him a year to finish. The finished product lent its title to his 1967 debut album. At 18:34, ‘Alice’s Restaurant’ takes up a complete side of the LP.Upon its release, ‘Alice’ was embraced by the counterculture. Guthrie’s humorous tale of being hassled by The (incompetent) Man struck a chord with the hippies, as did the absurdity of a convicted litterbug being too immoral to kill the North Vietnamese. Its creator doesn’t see it as an anti-war story, though. In the same NPR interview, Guthrie called his most famous work “a celebration of idiocy.”So the story/song became a crowd favorite, but at nearly 20 minutes long it could not fit onto a 45 RPM single. That meant no jukeboxes, no airplay, no Billboard Hot 100 — so in 1969 Guthrie, released a more conventional song that retained some of the story’s hallmarks, but is really very much its own thing:That’s not the only alternate version, either. ‘Alice: Before Time Began’ is an entirely separate story set to the same happy Piedmont riff:The story/song was such a phenomenon that it was made into a movie starring Guthrie in 1969. The real life Obie, Alice, and judge make appearances, too. A soundtrack was released that included a slightly different version of ‘Alice’s Restaurant’ along with several other Guthrie songs.Over the nearly 50 years since its initial release, Guthrie has updated the story a few times to reflect current events. None surpass the joy and energy of the original, though:And that’s the true tale of the true tale that has become a Thanksgiving tradition — even if it doesn’t really have anything to do with Thanksgiving.This Is Your Edible Thanksgiving Playlist

http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nascar-from-the-marbles/harvick-provides-the-chase-media-day-entertainment-013721757.html	Harvick provides the Chase Media Day entertainment	MIAMI, Fla., – While each of the four drivers competing for NASCAR's Sprint Cup on Sunday at Homestead-Miami Speedway will be a first-time champion if he wins the title, Denny Hamlin and Kevin Harvick are no strangers to the media festivities that precede the final race of the season.In 2010, Harvick and Hamlin were present with Jimmie Johnson. Then, Hamlin was clinging to a 15-point lead (old format) over Johnson and Harvick was 46 points back. Both Harvick and Johnson spent the session putting the pressure on Hamlin, who had just squandered at least 18 points to Johnson the previous race at Phoenix.Wednesday, Harvick was having some stone-faced fun again. But while Hamlin was stationed to Harvick's right, it was the driver on his left, Joey Logano, whom Harvick directed his comments toward.As Logano was addressing how the four drivers plan to race each other for the title (there were no promises of fender-banging from any of the drivers), Harvick brought up Logano's performance at Talladega.Logano threw a key block on the last lap at Talladega to help keep Harvick away from the lead and teammate Brad Keselowski in it. Keselowski won the race and advanced to the third round of the Chase. Had Harvick won, Keselowski would have been eliminated."I thought you were going to say you were going to send Brad out there to be a moving chicane like you were at Talladega," Harvick said.Logano, perhaps expecting Harvick's antagonization, laughed it off and answered promptly."I don't know what you're talking about, Kevin," Logano responded."Maybe you should ask Roger," Harvick said, referring to Team Penske owner Roger Penske."He's not here right now," Logano answered.After the exchange, Ryan Newman, the other title contender, (semi?) jokingly asked if he could answer the question.Because the four drivers are battling heads-up for the championship and the highest-finishing driver wins the title, there is a chance that teammates of the drivers in contention could play a role with strategy, or make it harder for a title-eligible driver to complete a pass.When asked if he was joking with Logano about Talladega, Harvick said he wasn't and then expounded when asked about the teammate variable. Harvick will have teammates, Kurt Busch, Danica Patrick and team co-owner Stewart in the race. Logano has Keselowski, Hamlin has Kyle Busch and Matt Kenseth and Newman has Austin Dillon and Paul Menard."You know, we've had this conversation in our shop, and it's just a race, because I believe – and I think Tony Stewart believes and all the management believes that in the end, trying to do those things like at Talladega, karma catches up with you," Harvick said. "I'm a firm believer in karma. At some point it comes full circle."In 2010, the talk about Hamlin might have gotten to him, though he said Wednesday it didn't. At one point four years ago, he even made a comment about how awkward it was.Logano wasn't fazed, laughing about it again after the news conference while in his breakout session."I actually kind of think it's a compliment," Logano said. "Because if you think about it, I'm up here with three of the best drivers here and teams. And that's really cool. It's a privilege to be here. And then to have one of them nervous about you means even more. I'm not here to play head games, I'm here to win a race, and he can play around as much as he wants. I'm having fun with this."Hamlin was happy to stay away from the fray."I think everyone knew that was coming, probably," Hamlin said. "Joey's the new guy, he's the young guy, and obviously he's got a great shot at a championship. And everyone's going to look for every advantage that they can get, whether it be coincidence or not that the person kind of poking fun is the person that gets under the other person's skin."You know, Kevin didn't beat me in 2010. I finished second to Jimmie. Jimmie wasn't necessarily the one prodding. I think it's more coincidence than anything, but you knew that Kevin was going to have a little fun out there, and obviously he's got some bad blood it looks like with some of the Penske guys anyway, so I'll just let all that play out and we'll just go out there and have fun and see what happens."- - - - - - -Nick Bromberg is the editor of From The Marbles on Yahoo Sports.

http://www.sbnation.com/golf/2014/11/11/7186761/rickie-fowler-phil-mickelson-ryder-cup-wgc-hsbc-champions-2014	Rickie Fowler takes subtle swings at Phil Mickelson, slow play in China	Rickie Fowler becomes the latest to weigh in on the Americans’ devastating Ryder Cup loss, defending captain Tom Watson for doing a ‘great job’ and taking Phil Mickelson to task for calling Watson out.Rickie Fowler may be one of Phil Mickelson’s proteges but that didn’t stop the colorful 25-year-old from indirectly criticizing his mentor for publicly bashing Tom Watson after the U.S. Ryder Cup team’s decisive loss to Europe in September.A regular among Lefty’s high-rolling practice-round playing partners and in the field at the slow-moving WGC-HSBC Champions event last week in China, Fowler defended Watson’s captaincy by saying the "legend" did a "great job.""The part that is the unfortunate part, I feel like, is stuff that I feel like happens in the team room, that’s said to the team behind closed doors, should stay there," Fowler told reporters on Saturday from Sheshan International GC. "I thought Tom did a great job of talking to the guys. He’s been there plenty of times, I enjoyed the time I got to spend with him. I respect him, he is a legend within the game.""Some things may have got blown a little bit out of proportion," added Fowler, who is part of the 11-person task force the PGA of America formed to determine how to win the next match on home turf at Hazeltine in 2016. "But obviously we didn’t play as well as we needed to in order to win."Fowler was also one of several players unhappy with the lackadaisical pace of play on Saturday at the HSBC."Yeah, it was too long," Fowler told AFP."I'm not sure what it was. The first two days didn't take as long. We didn't have as many waits," Fowler said about what early leader Graeme McDowell and his playing partner, Ian Poulter, complained were 5.5-hour rounds. "Today was a bit cooler and the rough did play tough with the rain and the moisture. I guess it just shows you what a little bit of weather conditions can do."GMac and Poulter were less charitable in their assessments of the time they spent on the Shanghai track."Ridiculous," McDowell told AFP after wrapping things up at 4:30 p.m. after teeing off at 10:50 a.m."There's no excuses. We need to be pressing and making sure people are keeping up to pace," Poulter opined. "Five and a half hours is too long to play golf. End of story."As for the much-criticized panel he will sit on with 44-year-old Mickelson and Tiger Woods, 38, among others, Fowler was boffo about the chance to fix what’s broken on the U.S. side of things."I’m obviously part of the task force and looking forward to getting together with the guys and everyone that's involved and see what everyone has to say," he said. "It sucks losing. Everyone's aware of that and everyone wants to win."
http://www.businessinsider.com/robert-coalson-russia-restarting-military-action-in-ukraine-2014-11	Here's Why Russia Just Escalated Its Military Action In Ukraine	AP/Mstyslav ChernovUnmarked military vehicles parked on a road outside the separatist rebel-held eastern Ukrainian town of Snizhne, 80 kilometers (50 miles) from Donetsk on Saturday Nov. 8, 2014.Fighting in eastern Ukraine — and particularly around the city of Donetsk — has flared up again, more intensely than anything since a shaky ceasefire was agreed to in Minsk on September 5.Journalists and other observers on November 7 reported seeing dozens of military vehicles, including tanks and armored personnel carriers, entering separatist-controlled areas of eastern Ukraine from Russia. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) confirmed the sightings the following day.Numerous videos of the convoy have appeared online.Moscow has denied Russia is involved in the fighting and has called for all parties to observe the Minsk agreement. The separatists claim that the convoys are merely reinforcements being moved toward Donetsk from other parts of the breakaway region.Pro-Kremlin analyst Sergei Markov, however, told the Daily Beast that Moscow is providing "multilayered support" to the separatist movement.What is the cause of the renewed military activity in eastern Ukraine?Here are a few possibilities: 'Election' ReactionOn November 2, the separatist authorities in eastern Ukraine held disputed elections that Kiev, the OSCE, the EU, and the United States said were illegitimate and a violation of the Minsk agreement. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said the voting "torpedoed" the Minsk process.In response, Poroshenko sent additional troops to the region and asked parliament to repeal a law on autonomy for the breakaway regions that was passed as part of the Minsk process."I think the recent transfer of equipment [from Russia to the separatists] is primarily defensive at this stage," said Tom Frear, a researcher at the European Leadership Network (ELN), in a written interview. "The rhetoric coming out of Kiev following the elections in the Donbass and the revocation of the autonomy agreement means that Russia and the Donbas leadership can't rule out a renewed Ukrainian offensive."Tactical ConsiderationsThe influx of equipment to the separatists could also signal a desire to solidify their positions and make some small local gains that could make it easier to get through the winter.The separatists may be seeking control of specific objects, such as a power plant to the north of Luhansk and Donetsk airport, Frear says. Such moves, he says, are "aimed at securing economic assets that make the long-term survival of the Luhansk People's Republic [LNR] and the Donetsk People's Republic [DNR] more plausible."Russian analyst Markov also told the Daily Beast that the separatists are seeking to take control over "Piski, Avdiivka, and Schastye, a town with a central heating station." In addition, he speculated they might want to recapture Slovyansk and Kramotorsk, which are "symbolically and strategically important towns for them."Building A Land BridgeMore dramatically, Moscow may be intent on adding territory to the separatist region that would give Russia a land bridge across eastern Ukraine to the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which Moscow annexed in March.The region is currently accessible to Russia only by air and across the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. Such a land bridge would make it much easier for Moscow to supply Crimea.Ivan Lozowy, an independent policy analyst based in Kiev, says establishing this land bridge is Putin's "unfinished business in eastern Ukraine" and "a priority" for him.It would, however, have to include the key city of Mariupol, which would be a difficult objective to capture.Mariupol "is pretty much dead set against letting the Russian troops through," Lozowy says. "The local residents have even been helping to build fortifications."And What About Kharkiv?The so-called Novorossia project has foundered in recent months, and could be strengthened if the separatists were able to get control of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city.Lozowy notes that the city has "symbolic significance," as well as being a major industrial center.In December 1917, Kharkiv was the first Ukrainian city to recognize the Bolshevik coup in Russia, and the city served as Ukraine's capital until 1935. Ukraine's largest tank producer is located in the region, among many other military-industrial enterprises."Undoubtedly, Kharkiv, which has remained on the whole indifferent to calls to join 'Novorossia,' really upsets certain circles both in Moscow and in the LNR and DNR," Russian military analyst Aleksandr Golts told openrussia.org on November 10.Lozowy says achieving the two goals of establishing a land bridge to Crimea and incorporating Kharkiv into the separatist territory would "bring Putin and the Kremlin very close to their original goal of building — or carving out, rather — a 'Novorossia' from Ukrainian territory."
https://www.yahoo.com/parenting/if-dads-are-supposed-to-date-their-daughters-does-that-101320428493.html	If Dads Are Supposed to Date Their Daughters, Does That Mean Moms Should Date Their Sons?	Photo by Everett ImagesBy Tom BurnsThis isn’t a popular opinion, but I’m not a fan of the term “daddy-daughter date.” And I know that’s not a popular opinion because I’ve written about my dislike of the term in the past and it’s always attracted a lot of negative feedback. People feel like I’m arguing semantics, people feel like I’m making something sound romantic that was never supposed to be, people feel like I’m criticizing fathers for wanted to spend time with their daughters, which couldn’t be further from the truth. Dads spending time with their daughters is a vitally important act—-hanging out with my daughter is literally my favorite thing in the whole wide world. That said, when people defend the notion of “daddy-daughter dates,” in my experience, their counter-arguments generally fall into one of two categories:1. It’s just a term for spending time together. Don’t make it into something it’s not.2. I take her on dates to show her how she should be treated by the men in her life.And, let’s say, for sake of argument, that both of those statements are true. If that’s the case, then why don’t moms typically “date” their sons? Why do these “dates” seem to be a strictly father-daughter phenomenon?In regards to category #1—-“It’s just a term”—-I have occasionally heard of moms saying that they have a “date” with their sons. I don’t think it’s as common, but it does happen, although most “mom-son” dates I’ve encountered revolve around something fairly innocuous, like going to the Lego Store together or going to see a movie. While I know some fathers and daughters who have similarly average outings, I’ve also seen many, many “daddy-daughter dates” that involve the dad and daughter dressing up in their best and actually going on a “faux-date”—-he brings her flowers, tells her she’s beautiful, they go out to a fancy dinner, maybe dancing. In fact, they have whole “daddy-daughter dances” that are structured in the exact same format as high school dances.And, maybe it’s just me, but I’ve never encountered moms and sons “spending time together” in the same way. I don’t know of any moms who get dressed up, bring their sons a boutonnière, and head out for a fancy night on the town. One can argue that girls might be more inclined to enjoy this “fancy dress-up” more than boys might—-although that’s a pretty big generalization—-but, regardless, I think it’s pretty obvious that there are some pretty big differences, both in terms of perception and execution, when it comes to daddy-daughter dates and mommy-son dates. (One of those differences is that no one ever uses the term “mommy-son date.”) It seems like mother-son time together revolves around hanging out, while people often feel the need to structure father-daughter time around the format and iconography of actual dating.Now, let me cut you off here, I am NOT saying that there is anything ROMANTIC about father-daughter dates. I am 100% NOT saying that. There simply isn’t anything romantic about them. HOWEVER, daddy-daughter dates DO often ape their structure from the kinds of dates that boys and girls might go on in high school, like a Homecoming date, or a fancy-dress night on the town with one’s spouse. And mother-son “dates” don’t generally use the same structure. And I’m curious why.This leads into category #2 in defense of father-daughter dates—-“I take her on dates to show her how she should be treated by the men in her life.” Again, I am not here to argue whether that is a valid or invalid point, but I will note that I can’t think of any time when those roles are traditionally flipped and mothers do something similar with their sons.Can you think of a time when a mom takes her son out, they get dressed up, and she’s trying to show her son how his future girlfriends should treat him later in life? I can’t. What would that look like? Dad-daughter date advocates often say things like “I open doors, I tell her she’s special, I bring flowers” to demonstrate how they’re using the date structure to show their daughters how they should expect to be treated by other men. And it IS a romantic date structure because men don’t usually bring flowers or go dancing when they’re trying to express their respect for their aunts, female work friends, or sisters.So… placed in the same situations, what are moms supposed to do with their sons? What would a mother-son “date” look like? Do they have to adhere to social clichés? Do the moms need to let their sons open doors or pay for the meal? Are the moms supposed to listen intently, laugh at his jokes, and tell him that’s he’s handsome? (How far should we push the clichés? Should the mom just order salad?)There’s this thing in our society where it’s socially acceptable for fathers to be held up as the “ideal men” for their daughters, but mothers aren’t supposed to be the “perfect women” for their sons. If a boy ends up with a woman who’s “just like his mother,” that’s generally perceived to be a bad or a weak thing.Should more moms be role-playing like this? If we have fathers taking their daughters on admittedly innocent “dates” to teach them about how men should respect them, should mothers be doing the exact same thing? Should mothers be using dates with their sons to prepare them for their future relationships?Personally, I feel like the answer is "No," but that’s just my opinion.There’s this thing in our society where it’s socially acceptable for fathers to be held up as the “ideal men” for their daughters, but mothers aren’t supposed to be the “perfect women” for their sons.I think parents spending time with their kids and showing their children respect is unfathomably important. But I’ve always been confused about why dads and daughters structure that time around “dates”—-roleplaying lessons in opposite-gender respect—-while the same expectation apparently doesn’t exist between mothers and sons. AND, this is important to note, this all assumes that the family is a heterosexual, 1950s nuclear family. What if the family has one son and two gay dads? Or one daughter and two lesbian moms? If there’s no dad, should the moms be taking the daughter out and showing her how to be respected at a fancy dinner and a formal dance? If there’s no mom, should the dads be doing the same thing with their son?Again, this has nothing to do with romance or sexuality. But, for some reason, we have decided that father-daughter time should involve an element of roleplay—-roleplay that’s undeniably based on the tropes of modern dating—-and mother-son time should not. And I think that’s odd.I do think that I’d be more accepting of the daddy-daughter date roleplaying if society placed just as much value on mothers and sons doing exactly the same thing. But it doesn’t. And I find that disparity both troubling and telling. (Don’t even get me started on the “Purity Balls” where daughters “pledge” their virginity and “purity” to their fathers. Can anyone show me ANY example of an institution where sons pledge their “purity” to their mothers? If it exists, I’d love to see it.)Ultimately, there are many, many ways to impart respect and love to your children. I have a powerful paternal love for my daughter, but, if she ever needs instruction on how she should be treated by a loved one in the future, I’m confident that all she’d need to do is see how I treat my wife or how our friends and family treat their significant others and those lessons would become apparent.My question stands—-should mothers be “dating” their sons? Should we have mother-son dances in the same way that we have daddy-daughter dances? And, if not, why? I’d love to hear your input because I have yet to hear an explanation that truly makes sense to me.Originally appeared at The Good Men ProjectMore from GMP:What’s a Dad to Do When His Daughter Wants to Dress as Han Solo?In Defense of the Older ParentHow I Supposedly Ended My Son’s Future as Car-Racing Phenomenon
http://www.vox.com/2015/8/20/9182725/beloit-mindset-list	College freshmen are the age of the Harry Potter books. You are hurtling toward death.	This year's 18-year-old college freshmen have never known a world without color photos on the front page of the New York Times, The Lion King on Broadway, or "super glue" in surgical operating rooms.If you think these are fascinating, illuminating facts that suddenly make young people understandable, the Beloit College Mindset List is for you. If you think this is a weird way to define a generation, let alone explain young adults to their elders, you're right.Every year, Beloit College in Wisconsin releases a list of what it calls "cultural touchstones" that define that year's 18-year-old college freshmen. Really, it exists for one reason: to make everyone else feel old.It's excellent at this. The Mindset List, which, like many but not all college freshmen, turns 18 this year, was social media gold even when "social media" meant "email forwards." Halfway through this year's 50-item list, I realized that, at 28, I might only be 10 years older than they are but I already have one foot in the grave. Today's freshmen were born the year the first Harry Potter book came out?! They don't remember a world without wifi?!It's a public relations ploy, and a very effective one (it's the only reason I could tell you anything about Beloit College). And a list of cultural references to make you realize that you're old is a fine thing to make. It's the concept that launched a thousand "Only '90s kids will remember" lists. But the Mindset List claims to be more than that — it wants to help aging professors decode Kids These Days.That's an admirable goal, and if the Mindset List actually did that, it would be useful.Defining a generation by what it doesn't remember is dumbThis Broadway marquee has been around as long as today's college freshmen have. (Andrew Burton/Getty Images)Instead, the list is a missed opportunity. College campuses are filled with faculty and administrators who seemingly don't understand 18-year-olds these days, what with their Snapchat and their trigger warnings and their inability to date. If the list actually tried to explain students' mindset, explain how communication has shifted, or even demonstrate that 18-year-olds, in many important ways, haven't changed all that much, it would be performing a service.But it doesn't. As usual, this year's list breaks down into a few categories:Possibly useful information that could come up in class. Today's 18-year-olds have never known a world without Google; Scotland and Wales have always had their own parliaments; since they were born, Hong Kong has always belonged to China.Pop culture anniversaries. The Lion King has always been on Broadway; "South Park" has always existed; Paul McCartney and Elton John have always been knights of the British Empire; Harry Potter books started being published the year they were born.Factoids. "Splenda has always been a sweet option in the US." "The Atlanta Braves have always played at Turner Field." "CNN has always been available en Español."Oh, great. I had no idea how to communicate with 18-year-olds, but now that I know they've never known a world without Splenda, it all becomes clear.The Mindset List assumes that 18-year-olds managed to graduate high school and get into college while remaining unaware of concepts like "history" or "progress," certain that nothing of import happened before they were born and that life has always been exactly the way it is today. It gives exactly one insight into how college freshmen think, the same insight it offers every year: These people were not alive all the time that you have been alive, and they might not remember things that you remember!And in doing so, rather than helping students and professors connect, it puts even more distance between them. The list reminds faculty that they are old and out of touch, and that their students are young and with it. It reinforces the idea that the pop culture that matters is the pop culture of a generation ago or more, not whatever 18-year-olds are watching and discussing and creating. It defines a generation by how they relate to the past, not how they're shaping the present.But it is really good at making you feel old.
http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/warriors-co-owner-joe-lacob-destroys-mark-jackson-and-his-former-staff-during-a-speech-012350662.html	Warriors co-owner Joe Lacob destroys Mark Jackson and his former staff during a speech	For decades, NBA owners have spoken at local banquets, charity functions or business-driven get-togethers and spoken freely about their teams behind a microphone. Rarely did their words get picked up by the press, though, because nobody really cared much about what Irv Levin said about the San Diego Clippers at some taffeta-rich function in 1981.Times have changed, and, as a result, one rarely hears an owner going all out in candidly discussing various executive decisions made about their respective franchises in public and especially on record. The Golden State Warriors made one massive executive decision last summer, dumping a 50-win coach in Mark Jackson who was fully supported by his players in order to hire Steve Kerr with a five-year deal. Kerr had yet to coach at any level, and Jackson had enjoyed significant standings success with the Warriors on top of the sturdy relationships he had built with his players.It should have been a baffling move. Instead, it was widely praised and understood by most. Kerr’s Warriors have roared out to a 16-2 start to the season, for various reasons, sustaining a strong defensive presence while cashing in on the team’s significant offensive gifts.Beaming from the fast start, Warriors co-owner Joe Lacob recently decided to completely toss Jackson and his former assistant coaching staff under the veritable bus while talking at a luncheon in front of the Western Association of Venture Capitalists/National Venture Capital Association. Holy lord, do I not want to lunch at that luncheon.Inside Bay Area’s Diamond Leung thankfully provided the transcript:"Right now, (Kerr) looks great," Lacob said at the Western Association of Venture Capitalists/National Venture Capital Association luncheon Wednesday. "I think he will be great. And he did the one big thing that I wanted more than anything else from Mark Jackson he just wouldn't do, in all honesty, which is hire the very best."Carte blanche. Take my wallet. Do whatever it is to get the best assistants there are in the world. Period. End of story. Don't want to hear it. And (Jackson's) answer . . . was, 'Well, I have the best staff.' No you don't. And so with Steve, very, very different."[…]"You can't have a staff underneath you that isn't that good," Lacob said. "And if you're going to get better, you've got to have really good assistants. You've got to have people that can be there to replace you. We all know this from all of our companies. It's . . . Management 101. A lot of people on the outside couldn't understand it when we (fired Jackson)."[…]"Part of it was that he couldn't get along with anybody else in the organization," Lacob said. "And look, he did a great job, and I'll always compliment him in many respects, but you can't have 200 people in the organization not like you."Hoo boy.Warriors players, to a man, will credit Jackson for doing good things to motivate them, and to shore up the team’s previously-terrible defense. You cannot knock the ascendency that was fostered under Jackson’s gauge.You can knock just about everything else, though.Since the beginning of the season, Warriors center Andrew Bogut has repeatedly praised the team’s new offensive sets without tossing so much as a qualifier in there to credit Jackson’s role in shaping this growing team. Stephen Curry has done as much, to a far lesser degree, and in a fantastic profile from Marcus Thompson released Friday, the once-beleaguered and now resurgent Harrison Barnes just about eviscerated Jackson in glorious passive/aggressive terms:“It’s hard when you get the ball in an iso situation and you have a set defense in front of you,” Barnes said. “Very few players in the league can do that. You look at the best – Durant, Melo, those guys – look at what percentage they shoot. And that’s the best of the best, so you can imagine where I’m at. I’m like at 15, 20 percent on isos. To get me with the ball moving, getting me in different spots, playing off other people, that’s more of a strength for me right now. Going straight isos, that wasn’t a strength for me.”They’re not really a strength for anyone. Even Kevin Durant and Carmelo Anthony, as Barnes mentioned, still need some form of misdirection and/or team play to remain potent in a five-man game. For the Golden State Warriors, more or less constructed as they currently are save for the production of David Lee, to finish 12th in offense last season was a basketball crime of the highest order. Kerr’s Warriors haven’t shot to the toppermost of the poppermost -- they’re still stuck at seventh overall -- but the emergence of Barnes as an all-around player says plenty.Lacob’s comments about Mark Jackson taking whatever he needed out of ownership’s wallet say quite a bit. Reportedly, Jackson chafed at the credit former assistant coach Mike Malone (now a head man in Sacramento) received during 2012-13 for Golden State’s rebound year, and Jackson fired the incredibly well-regarded assistant Darren Erman and re-assigned assistant Brian Scalabrine last season. Former Jackson assistant Pete Myers has acted as a long-time bench guy and sometimes-interim coach, but by and large reports out of Golden State suggested Jackson and his preferred crew tended to slough off dogged X's and O's preparation in the face of a killer Western Conference slate of opponents.If that falls into the unfortunate stereotype of the slick TV guy sliding over into the head coach’s seat, so be it. Steve Kerr went out to hire perhaps the two most respected assistant coaches he could – Alvin Gentry and Ron Adams – and appears fully ready to take on the sort of role that Larry Bird played in his near-championship turn as coach of the Indiana Pacers. Bird’s two top assistants were absolute world beaters, Rick Carlisle and Dick Harter, and Bird showed absolutely no hesitation prior to crediting them for more or less running the play-to-play show.Jackson – again, reportedly – appeared to have an issue on that end. Which may have led to Lacob’s claim that 200 people in the Warriors organization couldn’t stand the guy. We don’t like piling on, but we also don’t like catchphrases interrupting our nationally televised broadcasts of NBA games. That’s a tradeoff that we’ll take, though, if it means a championship-level team in Golden State is playing to its potential.The West is a killer, and there is a solid enough chance the Warriors could fall in the same first-round setting that ended their season in 2013 and last spring. Right now, though, the team is riding high, and the team’s owner is pointedly taking every chance he can to trash a former coach he clearly did not like.- - - - - - -Kelly Dwyer is an editor for Ball Don't Lie on Yahoo Sports.

He was white and Scottish. Period. That is who James Bond is," Limbaugh said."But now [they are] suggesting that the next James Bond should be Idris Elba, a black Briton, rather than a white from Scotland. But that's not who James Bond is."PHOTOS: James Bond actors—where are they now?And as if that wasn't bad enough…Limbaugh finished up his rant with an alarmingly self-aware thought."I know it's racist to probably point this out." Elba's spoken out about the rumors that he's on the short list to play Bond in the past.During a Reddit AMA, when asked if he would take the role, he shared, "Yes, if it was offered to me, absolutely."And in an interview with NPR, Elba opened up about the casting rumors and his concerns over how he'd be perceived."I just don't want to be called the first black James Bond. Do you understand what I'm saying? Sean Connery wasn't the Scottish James Bond and Daniel Craig wasn't the blue-eyed James Bond. So if I played him, I don't want to be called the black James Bond."PHOTOS: Let's check out these James Bond babes
http://www.businessinsider.com/the-worlds-most-powerful-militaries-2014-12	The 35 Most Powerful Militaries In The World	Sergei Karpukhin/REUTERSRussian servicemen march during the Victory Day parade in Moscow's Red Square May 9, 2014.There's only one real way to compare military strength, and thankfully the world hasn't had many opportunities lately.  Despite the potential powder keg in the South China Sea, standoffs in Ukraine, and proxy wars throughout the Middle East, inter-state warfare between the world's military powers has been all but banished from the global scene (for the time being, at least).For a simpler evaluation of military power, we turned to the Global Firepower Index, a ranking of 106 nations based on more than 50 factors including overall military budget, available manpower, and the amount of equipment each country has in its respective arsenal, as well as access to natural resources.The index focuses on quantity, ignoring significant qualitative differences — North Korea's 78 submarines, for instance, aren't exactly state of the art. It also does not factor in nuclear stockpiles, which are still the ultimate trump card in geopolitics. And it doesn't penalize landlocked nations for lack of a standing navy.We've created a chart to compare the top 35 militaries according to the Global Firepower Index. The ranking was released in April (before events like the Russian invasion of Eastern Ukraine in August, ISIS's blitz through Iraq, and the flare-up between Israel and Hamas) and involves a complex set of data that is subject to ongoing adjustments and corrections.Skye Gould/Business InsiderAmerica's investment in being the world's leading military force.The US clearly leads the world in military spending at more than $600 billion a year. China is in a distant second, at nearly $130 billion — less than one-third of America's overall spending. According to a report from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the US has reduced its defense budget by 7.8% chiefly because of America's gradual withdrawal in overseas military operations, such as in Afghanistan and Iraq.Russia, meanwhile, has increased its arms spending by $88 billion and plans to "modernize" its arsenal.Aircraft carriers are key, and very few countries have one.Aircraft carriers contribute greatly to a country's overall military strength. These massive vessels allow nations to project their force far beyond their borders and across the entire face of the globe. They're essentially mobile naval and air force bases. Aircraft carriers can also carry drones, which significantly change the global surveillance game.The US's absolute monopoly on super-carrier vessels significantly boosts the country's forward operating power. The US has deployed an aircraft carrier toward the Persian Gulf to bolster its sea and air power before possible strikes against ISIS in Iraq. Russia has previously deployed an aircraft carrier to the Mediterranean to display its seriousness in propping up Assad in Syria.North Korea's useless submarines.An anomaly in the Global Firepower index is North Korea's ranking as a world leader for submarines. And while it's true that Pyongyang commands the largest submarine fleet on earth, most of these vessels are unusable.A third of North Korea's subs are noisy diesel-powered Romeos, which have been obsolete since 1961. These submarines have a weapons range of only four miles, whereas a modern US submarine has a range of 150 miles. This fleet is unsophisticated but still durable, according to the US Department of Defense. 
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/13/kel-mitchell-alive-orange-soda_n_6135860.html	Here's What Really Happened To Kel Mitchell	Image: GiphyIf you're a '90s kid, you know all about Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell. The pair came into our lives in 1994 with the kids' sketch comedy show "All That," creating memorable characters like Pierre Escargot, Coach Kreeton and Ed from Good Burger. Soon they were both starring in their own show, "Kenan & Kel," and even in a major movie based on one of their Nickelodeon sketches. Kenan and Kel were a household name.A few years after their hit Nick show ended, both of the comedians auditioned for "Saturday Night Live." Thompson would go on to win a role on the show. He parlayed that success into a movie career, appearing in "Snakes on a Plane," "The Smurfs," "Fat Albert" and "Barbershop 2." The comedian has now been on "SNL" since 2003 and is the show's longest serving current cast member.Mitchell has another story. After parting ways with Thompson, the actor has largely flown under the radar. His name made national news again in 2006, but that was because everyone thought he was dead after an Internet hoax about the actor's alleged demise went viral. Since that turned out to be untrue, one question still remains ...Image: YouTubeRecently, HuffPost Entertainment spoke with Mitchell, and now we finally have an answer:So what have you been up to since "Kenan & Kel" ended? What have I been up to? Aw man, producing , directing, and often still acting. I was in "Like Mike 2," "Mystery Men," and also was on a great show, "Clifford the Big Red Dog." I have a show called "Wild Grinders" on Nicktoons with Rob Dyrdek. "Who Can I Run To," a really fun movie. Also, I’ve been starring in a lot of different shows like "Sam & Cat" on Nickelodeon. I’ve been fortunate to still be in this business and still be able to work in really great jobs.What was it like dealing with that death hoax? That was crazy. I remember that day. It was all over the Internet. I think it started on MySpace because that’s when MySpace was popular. I had family members calling me and calling my parents saying, "Is Kel okay?" And all this stuff.It was pretty crazy, but I didn’t get upset by the whole thing. It was just like, "What kind of sick mind would do that?" But afterward, it was kind of cool with people going, I mean not the action of it was cool, but it was like when people discovered that I was alive, it was just like, “Oh, okay. Well, what else is he doing?"How was it being reunited with "All That" creator Dan Schneider on "Sam & Cat"? And how was working with Ariana Grande and Jennette McCurdy? That was awesome. Dan’s cool. I mean I’ve known him since I was a kid, so to work with him again was a lot of fun. At first I was doing the character kind of laid back, and he was like, "Naw, man. Let’s do it how we used to back in the day. Let’s do it crazy like Coach Kreeton and those guys," so I was like, “Aw yeah! Let’s do it."I remember I was on set, and Ariana and Jenette told me that they were fans of mine when they were kids, and so they saw me and they were like, “Man, this is so surreal." And I’m also a fan of theirs. Ariana’s music and also Jenette's comedy is so hilarious to me, so we all actually kept in touch.Is there anything from your "All That" days that might surprise fans? One thing was at Universal Studios in Florida, where we did the first couple seasons, we used to go and ride all the cool rides, and they would let us skip all the lines. King Kong and all that stuff -- we would literally go and do it on our lunch break or any time we felt like it, and it was kind of fun because if you can imagine growing up as a kid and having an amusement park in your backyard basically.You gave us some of the most memorable '90s catchphrases: "Who loves orange soda?" "Welcome to Good Burger," and "I dropped the screw in the tuna." How did those actually come about? Dan actually wrote out, "Who loves orange soda? Kel loves orange soda," but then the whole, "I do. I dooOoo," and all that stuff, I just put swag on it. [Laughs] It just came alive. We didn’t know that it was gonna blow up like that.For "I dropped the screw in the tuna," I was just supposed to say, "I dropped the screw in the tuna." That was like it, and I was supposed to be hurt about it, but I took it up a notch, and the director was just like, "Just go." Even now, people come up to me and say, "Who dropped the screw in the tuna?" That was one of my favorite episodes. I actually won a CableACE award because of that episode.Would you be interested in doing a reunion for "All That" or "Kenan & Kel"? Yeah. Being that I’m still doing stuff with Nickelodeon and they’re always coming up with cool ideas, so, if that was to happen, it would be fun. A lot of us all stay in contact with each other, and we see each other around and stuff like that. It’s just about if it could happen or not because everybody’s schedules are all over the place, but I’m open to it. That would be fun. Like a one time special or something like that.Do you really love orange soda? Yes! I do love orange soda. [Laughs] It’s funny because I was actually a soda drinker, and actually I used to drink it as a kid. And when they had me do it, I was like, "Cool! I get to drink orange soda all the time now!" So even now, I’ll drink orange soda every now and then.What's your favorite drink now? Orange soda is still the No. 1, but other than that it’d have to be water.Image: GiphyWhat do you think about Kenan possibly leaving "SNL"? I’ve always been happy for him on "SNL," and I watch it when I can. And if he’s making a decision to leave, he knows what he’s doing. So I’m sure he has something else brewing because he’s been on the show for so many years. I’m happy for him either way -- whatever he does.There's been a lot of speculation about a beef with Kenan. Is there any truth to that? No, no, no, there’s no beef. Everything’s all good.Could there be a Kenan and Kel collaboration in the future? I haven’t talked to Kenan in a while, so I don’t know if that would be any type of collaboration. I know the fans want it, but I don’t know. You know, I think that I’m working on different things; he’s working on different things. And I know everyone likes the "Kenan & Kel" brand, but I don’t know. We’ll have to see. It’s kind of like the movies with "Dumb and Dumber." Everybody wanted to see that again when it came back, so I don’t know. We’ll have to see what the future may hold.Mitchell may not know what the future holds, but at least we finally know what happened to Kel. We do. We do. We doOoo.Image: GiphyThis interview has been edited and condensed.For more news on Kel Mitchell, you can find him on Twitter and visit KelMitchell.net.
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eat-the-press/2007/03/15/rosie-odonnell-paul-ste_e_43536.html	Eat The Press | Rosie O'Donnell, Paul Steiger Are Skeptical About Khalid Sheikh Mohammed	from Newsbusters.orgRachel Sklar |  Posted Thursday March 15, 2007 at 05:16 PMYesterday, news broke that Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, lieutenant of Osama bin Laden, had confessed to masterminding and committing a long list of terrorist acts, including 9/11, the Bali bombing, and the violent murder of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl. He also led plots to assassinate Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and the Pope. Mohammed, who has been held at Guantanamo Bay since 2003, said that his confessions had not been made under duress. Still, he confessed to a whole lot of stuff. Which has made some people raise an eyebrow.One of those people was Rosie O'Donnell on The View, who seemed troubled by his long period of captivity and more than a bit skeptical:I think the man has been in custody of the American government, in secret CIA torture prisons in Guantanamo Bay, where torture is accepted and allowed, and he finally is the guy who admits to doing everything. They finally found the guy. It's not that guy bin Laden. It's this guy they've had since '93. And look, this is the picture they released of him. Doesn't he look healthy?Similarly, WSJ managing editor, expressed some skepticism to E&P's Joe Strupp: "We don't know the circumstance of what he is saying," Steiger said. "You don't know what might be boasting, what might be coercion." In that respect, he agreed with Elisabeth Hasselbeck, with whom Rosie had this exchange:O'DONNELL: After hood on his head and beaten to death. HASSELBECK: Do you know that a hood was on his head that he was beaten? O'DONNELL: Oh dear God, Elisabeth. HASSELBECK: He's still alive. O'DONNELL: Why, since March 2003 has he not admitted it until now?These are a lot of questions. What might be boasting? What might be coercion? Was he coerced? Was he tortured? Do authorities have any independent confirmation? Has he confessed to anything that was not public knowledge? Has he given up any information leading to future arrests? It seems that these are questions that are germane to those on both the right and the left, who, rightly, would seek to make decisions based on the fullest possible information, rather than assumptions based on a partial release of facts. Okay that might be giving Rosie the benefit of the doubt; according to the transcript at Newsbusters (and the video here at Hot Air), she sorta seems to be coming down on the side of KSM-as-victim, which not surprisingly doesn't make her too popular around those parts. (According to Council on Global Terrorism director Justine Rosenthal, with the appropriate torture-related caveats, "the confession is reasonable and certainly fits with what we know"). But then again, that's only what we know, since "[o]ther parts of the transcript were redacted by the military, and there were suggestions in it that Mr. Mohammed contended he was mistreated while in the custody of the C.I.A." And then of course there's this, per the NYT:By tribunal rules, Mr. Mohammed was aided by a "personal representative," not a lawyer. His attempt to call two witnesses was denied. And the tribunal indicated that it would consider classified evidence not made available to Mr. Mohammed.So really, it's very difficult to assert anything with certainty right now. But it's a little disquieting to listen to the laugher of the View audience and they try to figure out what they should be cheering for and what should bother them.
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/10/01/schoolchildren-have-come-into-contact-with-texas-ebola-patient/20970709/	Schoolchildren have come into contact with Texas Ebola patient, officials say	The man diagnosed with Ebola in Texas came into contact with school schoolchildren now being monitored by health experts, officials have revealed.Texas Governor Rick Perry made the surprise announcement during a Wednesday afternoon press conference only one day after federal officials revealed a man in Dallas had become the first Ebola diagnosis in the U.S. He has been identified as Thomas Eric Duncan.Officials have also determined Duncan came into contact with about 12 to 18 people since returning from Africa. He flew from Liberia to Brussels before connecting to a Dallas-bound flight, a Canadian health officials told Reuters."Today we learned that some school-aged children have been identified as having had some contact with the patient and are now being monitored at home," said Perry.The interaction between Duncan and the children came before he showed symptoms, Perry stressed. They are being kept out of classes while being monitored as a precaution.Dallas school officials said the children had no symptoms while in classes.The four schools attended by the five students have taken precautions including staffing extra health professionals to answer questions and check flu-like symptoms.Additional custodians have also been added to provide further cleanliness.Federal officials said yesterday that the virus can be killed simply by washing one's hands with soap and water.Health officials are scrambling to identify further people who may have come into contact with the man, who contracted the deadly virus during a recent trip to Liberia."When the patient arrived on Sunday, he was recognized as a possible case," said Dr. Edwin Goodman, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital epidemiologist. "He was placed in isolation and there have been no exposures since."Goodman added that there "is little likelihood a healthcare worker was exposed."It was also revealed that 133 Centers for Disease Control personnel are on the ground in West Africa trying to help combat the killer virus.Perry insisted Texas is best positioned to combat Ebola because of preparations that began months ago."There are few places in the world better equipped to meet the challenge that is posed in this case," said Perry.Texas is one of only 13 states certified by the CDC to test for the Ebola virus. The state has been able test for Ebola since August, according to Perry."We have healthcare professionals and institutions that are second to none," Perry said.Officials also again stressed that Ebola is not an airborne threat."It's not going to be transmitted through the air, through casual contact with other individuals," said the governor. "It's harder to contract than the common cold."The death toll from this deadly Ebola outbreak has hit 3,338 people, according the World Health Organization.Texas officials are adamant the death toll will not be added to in their state.
http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/12/12/cavemen-get-warm/20297727/	Cave find suggests when humans figured out fire	As early human milestones go, it's as big as they get: the "invention" of fire.Or more precisely, the mastering of fire.Now archaeologists studying an ancient cave in Israel say they've figured out when humans managed the feat: about 350,000 years ago, reports Science.Researchers discovered that burned flints began showing up regularly around that time in Tabun Cave near Haifa.Humans were using the cave as long as 500,000 years ago, and they apparently had the occasional fire way back then, but they didn't learn to control it and start campfires at will for a while.'While the earliest evidence of fire associated with hominin activities is much older, the data presented here indicate that fire became a regular and constant part of hominin behavioral adaptations in Eurasia only after 350,000 years ago," says Ron Shimelmitz of the University of Haifa, as quoted in the Daily Mail.Both stories says the study in the Journal of Human Evolutionwon't end the debate:Other prominent archaeologists say that controlled fire must have come along much earlier and played a role in the evolution of our bigger brains and smaller guts.This article originally appeared on Newser: Cave Find Suggests When Humans Figured Out FireMore from Newser:Newseris a USA TODAY content partner providing general news, commentary and coverage from around the Web.

http://recode.net/2014/11/20/facebooks-building-out-its-drone-team/	Facebook Is Building Out Its Drone Team	Facebook is aggressively working to expand a team to build drones and other aircraft, according to people familiar with the company’s plans.The company posted three new drone-related job openings on its website Thursday, seeking avionics, thermal, and power systems and control engineers to work on aircraft-related projects. Facebook was already advertising three aerospace-related job openings, seeking both technicians and engineers to work out of the company’s London office.Those postings were published a few months after its acquisition of U.K.-based drone maker Ascenta in March, and a Facebook spokesperson confirmed that while the new job openings posted Thursday are for Facebook’s California offices, whoever is hired will work closely with the team in the U.K.According to the aerospace postings, Facebook is looking for both associate and lead technicians to help with assembly of an aircraft’s mechanical structure, and it’s also looking for an engineer to “assist in the development, inspection and testing of a high-altitude solar powered aircraft.”Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote in March that Facebook is looking to “build drones, satellites and lasers to deliver the internet to everyone” as part of the company’s Internet.org initiative to get the entire world online. Yael Maguire, head of Facebook’s Connectivity efforts, told Mashable CEO Pete Cashmore in September that Facebook’s drones will be more like planes, possibly as big as a 747.Maguire said the company is aiming to get its first drones or planes in the air by 2015.

http://www.aol.com/article/2014/11/22/civic-group-no-ferguson-grand-jury-decision-yet/20997722/	Civic group: No Ferguson grand jury decision yet	FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) - Crews erected barricades Saturday around the building where a grand jury has been considering whether to indict the Ferguson police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown, even as a grand jury decision seemed unlikely this weekend.Tension has been mounting in Ferguson and elsewhere in the St. Louis area in recent days, with many speculating that the grand jury's decision would be announced on Sunday. That seemed increasingly unlikely by Saturday afternoon, although there was a noticeable uptick in the preparations being made.Downtown STL Inc., a St. Louis civic group that promotes downtown businesses, told members in an email Saturday that the grand jury will reconvene Monday to continue deliberating whether charges are warranted against Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson in the Aug. 9 fatal shooting of Brown.The email did not explain how the group knew the information, and a spokeswoman declined comment. Ed Magee, a spokesman for St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch, didn't respond to several messages Saturday.The Brown family's attorney, Ben Crump, said Saturday that he hadn't heard a decision had been reached and that prosecutors had promised to tell him when that happened.Wilson is white and Brown, who was unarmed, was black. There have been many demonstrations in the months since Brown's death, including some that were violent. Police arrested three protesters on Friday night - the third straight night of unrest in Ferguson.On Saturday, authorities set up barricades around the Buzz Westfall Justice Center in Clayton, which is where the grand jury has been meeting.Barricades also went up in the shopping center parking lot on West Florissant Avenue in Ferguson, which was where police set up a makeshift command center in the immediate aftermath of Brown's death.Several businesses in both Ferguson and Clayton have put boards on their windows.Residents were on edge, too.Jamie Freeman of Ferguson, 38, a registered nurse and mother of four, said she was especially concerned since her 20-year-old son lives in the neighborhood where Brown was shot."I just hope it stays peaceful," Freeman said of protests that will follow the grand jury decision. "We all have human emotions, but there's a way to do things, and violence, you can't get peace from violence."Crump, the Brown family attorney, said the grand jury process is weighted against those shot by police officers."Ninety-nine percent of the time the police officer is not held accountable for killing a young black boy," Crump said. "The police officer gets all the consideration."The FBI has sent nearly 100 additional agents to Ferguson to help law enforcement agencies, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss the FBI plans.But things were calm during the day on Saturday. Brown's father, Michael Brown Sr., joined a church group in passing out free turkeys to needy residents in the area where his son was shot. A day earlier, a video of Brown Sr. was released urging peace, regardless of how the announcement goes.

http://www.voanews.com/content/kyiv-rebels-another-round-talks-minsk-/2455863.html	Donetsk Blasts as Kyiv, Rebels Cut Deal	The Ukrainian city of Donetsk was rocked by blasts on Saturday, even as government forces and pro-Russian separatists prepared to create a buffer zone to separate the warring sides.Participants at Ukrainian peace talks in Belarus agreed on Saturday to create a buffer zone 30-kilometers wide, moving artillery on the front line to separate Ukrainian government troops and pro-Russian separatists.A Reuters correspondent in Donetsk, the main industrial hub in Ukraine's turbulent east, said several powerful explosions were heard in the morning. A plant producing munitions and industrial explosives had been hit, municipal authorities said.Explosions were also heard from the direction of the main international airport which government forces are still clinging on to despite rebels' attempts to loosen their control.One Ukrainian soldier was killed and seven others were wounded in overnight violence, a military official told journalists.“According to the text of the memorandum, each of the sides must pull back its heavy equipment and arms from today,” Volodymyr Polyovy, an official of Ukraine's national security and defense council, told journalists on Saturday.Cease-fire 'in name only'NATO's top military commander said on Saturday he hoped the buffer zone would calm the situation in eastern Ukraine because the truce there now is a cease-fire “in name only.”“The situation in Ukraine is not good right now,” U.S. Air Force General Philip Breedlove told reporters in Vilnius, Lithuania. “Basically, we have cease-fire in name only.“The number of events, and the number of rounds fired and the artillery used across the past few days match some of the pre-ceasefire levels. The ceasefire is still there in name, but what is happening on the ground is quite a different story," he said.Speaking after a meeting of chiefs of defense of NATO countries in Vilnius, Breedlove, who is NATO's Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, and commander of U.S. forces in Europe, said Russia has moved some of its forces inside Ukraine to the south to bring pressure on the port city of Mariupol.On Friday, a third round of talks between representatives of Ukraine's government and pro-Russian separatists opened in Minsk, amid reports that renewed shelling in eastern Ukraine had claimed several lives.Attending the latest meeting in Belarus' capital were Ukraine's former president Leonid Kuchma and several officials of the rebels' self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk "people's republics," along with Russia's Ambassador to Ukraine Mikhail Zurabov and representatives of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.During the last meeting of the so-called Contract Group, which took place in Minsk on September 5, the representatives of Kyiv and the rebels signed a 12-point cease-fire protocol that included concessions to the separatists.Under the agreement, which was approved by Ukraine's parliament, the areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions under rebel control will be granted temporary special self-rule status, including the right to set up their own police forces and appoint prosecutors and judges. Ukraine's parliament also approved a broad amnesty for many rebel fighters.Sporadic fighting has continued in eastern Ukraine despite the cease-fire that went into effect on September 5.Aid convoyOn Saturday, a convoy of Russian trucks entered Ukraine with humanitarian aid for Donetsk - the third such convoy sent to eastern Ukraine in recent weeks.The convoy of about 250 trucks from Russia arrived on the outskirts of Donetsk, though Ukrainian officials said they had crossed from Russia without authorization and in violation of international law.Two of the drivers said the convoy had brought in a 2,000-ton cargo of aid including flour, tinned meat and fish, and power generators. The humanitarian aid will be distributed to seniors, children, the disabled and families with multiple children in 25 aid stations in Donetsk, a member of the local armed militia told The Associated PressRussia has also sent about 4,000 tons of aid to Luhansk, Ukraine, in two convoys.Some information in this report was provided by Reuters, AP and AFP.
http://www.voanews.com/content/australian-government-approves-airstrikes-in-iraq/2471110.html	Fighting Continues in Northern Syria	Islamic State militants are continuing their advance on the northern Syrian town of Kobani near the Turkish border, where Kurdish fighters have been struggling to repel them for weeks.The assault has forced more than 160,000 Syrians to flee into Turkey. On Friday, Islamic State shelling continued to bombard the outskirts of the Kurdish town known as Ayn al Arab, despite recent airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition formed to combat the extremist group.The coalition has been bombing the militants' positions for weeks, but has made little headway. Turkey has also vowed to do whatever it can to keep Kobani from falling to IS fighters.The White House Friday welcomed the Turkish parliament's vote Thursday authorizing Turkish military activity against Islamic State in both Syria and Iraq.White House spokesman Josh Earnest also praised contributions by Australia, Denmark, and the Netherlands to contribute fighter aircraft.He said the U.S. will continue to work with its international partners to expand its approach "to degrade and ultimately defeat" the Islamic State fighters.Australia Joins CoalitionAustralia, meanwhile, on Friday approved joining the air campaign in Syria, as well as deploying special forces.Prime Minister Tony Abbott said it was in Australia's interest to help defeat the extremist group, which he referred to as a "death cult."“It is in everyone’s best interests that the murderous rage of the ISIL death cult be checked and rolled back, and that is what we are determined to do,” Abbott said. “ISIL has declared war on the world, ISIL is launching an assault on civilization, not just upon the people of Iraq right now.”Australian troops will not likely be directly involved in combat missions, but he warned the deployment "could be quite lengthy, certainly months rather than weeks.”Australia has already sent 400 air force personnel, 200 special force soldiers and 11 aircraft to the United Arab Emirates in preparation for the impending operations.The government estimates 160 Australians are either fighting with or supporting the Islamic State, which has set up a self-declared Islamic caliphate in parts of Iraq and Syria.Abbott refused to say whether his country would also consider joining U.S. and Arab countries in striking Syria targetsNew laws have also been introduced to the Australian parliament giving the authorities greater powers to combat the threat of homegrown extremism. Last month, a teenage terror suspect was shot dead by police in Melbourne after two officers were stabbed.Kurdish ConcernsKobani’s defense chief, meanwhile, that a large-scale massacre by Islamic State militants is imminent without international aid.In an interview with VOA's Kurdish Service, Ismet Sheikh Hasan also said Kurdish defenders felt abandoned by U.S.-led coalition forces, despite the airstrikes.VOA's Phil Mercer contributed to this story from Sydney, Australia.
http://news.yahoo.com/police-body-woman-car-missing-california-family-082146419.html	Police find body of woman in car of missing California family	(Reuters) - Police in southern California found the body of a woman on Wednesday inside the trunk of a car belonging to a family of six that has been missing for days, officials said.Authorities in the Los Angeles suburb of Montebello have been searching for the Perez family since they were reported missing on Tuesday, police said in a statement.Around 5:00 p.m. local time on Wednesday, authorities found a Honda Accord belonging to the family and inside discovered a woman's body. Police did not release the name of the woman, pending positive identification from the local coroner.The family of 39-year-old Erica Perez, 43-year-old Daniel Perez and their four sons aged between 6 and 11 years old, were last seen on Friday, police said."We will work around the clock to locate them and locate them safely," Montebello police Captain Luis Lopez said, according to the Los Angeles Times.Montebello police said the parents' unstable marriage had been troubled with a history of domestic violence. Authorities are investigating the incident as a homicide, and consider Daniel Perez to be a person of interest.Authorities said neither of the parents had been answering their phones or returning messages, and that Daniel Perez had not shown up for work for two consecutive days.Montebello is a city of 62,500 people, roughly 9 miles (14 km) east of Los Angeles.(Reporting by Curtis Skinner in San Francisco; Editing by Catherine Evans)

http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2014/12/31/7471193/why-jim-harbaugh-left-nfl-michigan	Why Jim Harbaugh left the NFL	The NFL media struggled to accept the idea of Jim Harbaugh leaving professional football to coach at Michigan. They overlooked what really drove his decision."The coaches keep the pressure on me, to be better than the last time, to get the best out of me. But see, I realize that. There is nothing older than yesterday's success.''-- Jim Harbaugh on October 9, 1986 as Michigan's senior quarterbackJim Harbaugh told me that 28 years ago in a one-on-one interview at Bicycle Jim's Restaurant in Ann Arbor. He was at Michigan, I was covering him and his team for the Detroit Free Press and we both fell under the allure and awe of then Michigan coach Bo Schembechler.It wasn't any other way with Bo. Whether you played for him or wrote about him, his direct, blunt, candid and yet wisdom-filled sincerity took hold. As a player, Harbaugh disagreed with him. As a writer, I disagreed with him. But his persistence and integrity could not be denied. He made you think. He made you take a second look -- and sometimes a third.This is the essence of Jim Harbaugh, the blueprint he followed for his 14-year NFL playing career and for each of his head coaching stops at the University of San Diego, Stanford and the San Francisco 49ers. His parents, Jack and Jackie, laid that foundation. Schembechler and Mike Ditka were coaches who helped cement it.Harbaugh has returned to those roots. He called it a "homecoming.''Becoming the 20th head coach at Michigan is something he said he had dreamed about. Now, he said, it is time to live it.It is time, in part, because his relationships with 49ers management became so frosty and fractured that a split was in order. It appears it reached a pinnacle during contract talks before last season, when the 49ers made him feel relatively worthless. If you make Jim Harbaugh feel unappreciated, unwanted, not worth it, he is not the type to hang around. It is time, in part, because there is a need at Michigan football and a call to answer. An open door, a wide-open embrace, appreciation and that feeling of being wanted was a blanket tossed all over him by Michigan leadership. Michigan's need and approach captivated him."This is a decision I made from the heart,'' Harbaugh said.Several pundits insisted that he would never leave NFL coaching. They did not understand the lingering pull of Bo or Harbaugh's love and loyalty to Michigan. His need to feel wanted. Appreciated. Comfortable. The need for his ego to be stroked and his heart to be touched.He used to share stories with me at Michigan about how as a youth he kept individual statistics on his batting average in baseball, scoring average in basketball and touchdowns in football. He memorized them. Few peers wanted to play with the pre-teen Harbaugh because of his overwhelming competitiveness and ego. It was at Michigan that Harbaugh learned the soul of Schembechler's chief mantra: THE TEAM, THE TEAM, THE TEAM.But that competitive fire lives. He just channels it better now.His father first coached at Michigan under Schembechler in 1973. Harbaugh signed with Michigan as a student-athlete in 1982. And now this. A homecoming. A new challenge. In many ways, an inevitable one.If you make Jim Harbaugh feel unappreciated, unwanted, not worth it, he is not the type to hang around.He said in his introductory news conference about recruiting that he will be selling something that he "believes in to the core.'' Selling something that he knows as well as "you know your name.'' That will not be a hard job, he said. He talked about relationships. Especially renewing spirited and meaningful ones at Michigan and in Ann Arbor.And what he didn't say spoke volumes: that he left the 49ers with those kinds of relationships in tatters, broken, too ripped to mend.He will not rest on what he has done in coaching. That's yesterday's success. He will push it all forward. He will push hard.Jim Harbaugh came back to Michigan to fix, to heal what is broken. To re-emphasize what really matters to him. To find peace. To stand on the shoulders of so many men and to a place he respects. To rebuild what Schembechler built. To repay. To honor. To create happiness over hurt.In Michigan. And in himself.
http://www.businessinsider.com/china-is-diminishing-the-uss-air-power-superiority-2014-12	China Is Diminishing The US's Air Power Superiority	Chinese Military ReviewChina's J-20 fifth-generation fighterThe US Air Force’s air power superiority over China is rapidly diminishing in light of rapid Chinese modernization of fighter jets, cargo planes and stealth aircraft, according to a recently released Congressional review.The 2014 US-China Economic and Security Review Commission recommends that Congress appoint an outside panel of experts to assess the US-Chinese military balance and make recommendations regarding U.S. military plans and budgets, among other things.The Commission compiled its report based upon testimony, various reports and analytical assessments along with available open-source information. The review states that the Chines People’s Liberation Army currently has approximately 2,200 operational aircraft, nearly 600 of which are considered modern.“In the early 1990s, Beijing began a comprehensive modernization program to upgrade the PLA Air Force from a short-range, defensively oriented force with limited capabilities into a modern, multi-role force capable of projecting precision air power beyond China’s borders, conducting air and missile defense and providing early warning,” the review writes.One commissioner involved with the review told Military​.com he wants to see Congress provide the requisite funding for the US to retain its technological superiority in light of China’s rapid progress. This includes providing funding for the Pentagon’s Pacific rebalance, he said.“Every year we make forty to fifty recommendations to Congress. Commissioners highlight what they consider to be the most important ten recommendations.  This year among the top ten recommendations was one to ensure that the budget to meet the Pacific rebalance is adequate,” said Larry Wortzel, a commissioner tasked with helping to oversee the compilation and publication of the annual review.Regarding stealth aircraft, the review mentions the recent flights of prototypes of the Chinese J-20 stealth fighter, calling the aircraft more advanced than any other air platform currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region. The Chinese are also testing a smaller stealth fighter variant called the FC-31, according to the report.China recently displayed the Shenyang FC-31 stealth fighter at China’s Zhuhai Air Show. However, several analysts have made the point that it is not at all clear if the platform comes close to rivaling the technological capability of the US F-35.However, the US technological advantage in weaponry, air and naval platforms is rapidly decreasing, according to the review. To illustrate this point, the review cites comments from an analyst who compared US-Chinese fighter jets to one another roughly twenty years ago versus a similar comparison today.REUTERS/Alex LeeA J-31 stealth fighter of Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force is seen during a test flight ahead of the 10th China International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition in Zhuhai, Guangdong province, November 10, 2014. More than 130 planes will attend the six-day air show starting on Tuesday, Xinhua News Agency reported.The analyst says in 1995 a high-tech US F-15, F-16 or F/A-18 would be vastly superior to a Chinese J-6 aircraft. However today — China’s J-10 and J-11 fighter jet aircraft would be roughly equivalent in capability to an upgraded US F-15, the review states.Alongside their J-10 and J-11 fighters, the Chinese also own Russian-built Su-27s and Su-30s and are on the verge of buying the new Su-35 from Russia, the review states.“The Su-35 is a versatile, highly capable aircraft that would offer significantly improved range and fuel capacity over China’s current fighters. The aircraft thus would strengthen China’s ability to conduct air superiority missions in the Taiwan Strait, East China Sea, and South China Sea as well as provide China with the opportunity to reverse engineer the fighter’s component parts, including its advanced radar and engines, for integration into China’s current and future indigenous fighters,” the review writes.In addition to stealth technology, high-tech fighter aircraft and improved avionics, the Chinese have massively increased their ability with air-to-air missiles over the last 15-years, the review finds.“All of China’s fighters in 2000, with the potential exception of a few modified Su-27s, were limited to within-visual-range missiles. China over the last 15 years also has acquired a number of sophisticated short and medium-range air-to-air missiles; precision-guided munitions including all-weather, satellite-guided bombs, anti-radiation missiles, and laser-guided bombs; and long-range, advanced air-launched land-attack cruise missiles and anti-ship cruise missiles,” the review says.The review also points to the Y-20 aircraft, a new strategic airlifter now being tested by the Chinese which has three times the cargo-carrying capacity of the U.S. Air Force’s C-130.  Some of these new planes could be configured into tanker aircraft, allowing the Chinese to massively increase their reach and ability to project air power over longer distances.Pkistan DefenceAt the moment, the Chinese do not have a sizeable or modern fleet of tankers, and many of their current aircraft are not engineered for aerial refueling, a scenario which limits their reach.“Until the PLA Navy’s first carrier-based aviation wing becomes operational, China must use air refueling tankers to enable air operations at these distances from China. However, China’s current fleet of air refueling aircraft, which consists of only about 12 1950s-era H–6U tankers, is too small to support sustained, large-scale, long-distance air combat,” the review states.Using Y-20s as tankers would make China more effective into the South China Sea and the East China Sea, Wortzel explained.The review also cites Russian media reports claiming that Russia has approved the sale of its new, next-generation S-400 surface-to-air-missile to China.“Such a sale has been under negotiation since at least 2012. The S–400 would more than double the range of China’s air defenses from approximately 125 to 250 miles — enough to cover all of Taiwan, the Senkaku Islands, and parts of the South China Sea,” the review says.The review also catalogues information related to China’s nuclear arsenal and long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles such as the existing DF-31 and DF-31A along with the now-in-development DF-41.“They already have road-mobile ICBMs that carry nuclear weapons. The DF-41 is expected to have as many as 10 re-entry vehicles,” Wortzel added.Some prominent lawmakers, such as HASC Seapower and Projection Forces subcommittee chairman Rep. Randy Forbes, R-Va., have expressed concern regarding the review’s findings.  Forbes has consistently talked about the U.S. need to properly address the potential threat posed by rapid Chinese military modernization and expansion.“If you look back at the approach the Pentagon was taking 10 years ago, they were missing what China was doing. China was growing geometrically,” Forbes told Military​.com in an interview. “I think we have to be looking globally to make sure we are creating the kind of strategies that are going to be necessary to defend this country a decade from now or two decades from now.”Forbes emphasized that while working toward peace and stability and improving relations with the Chinese is important, the US must nevertheless modernize and prepare its military based upon Chinese capability rather than Chinese intent.“You have to prepare based on capability because intent could change overnight with one incident,” he said.

If you pay $20 or $30 for a meal, you probably expect it to be prepared carefully and with quality ingredients, whereas if you pay three bucks for a meal, you may expect a few shortcuts here and there. But, at the end of the day, even if a restaurant microwaves nacho cheese sauce or prepares a few ingredients in advance, the meal should still be delicious (and safe) — no matter how much it costs.But if you have any experience working in the restaurant business, you know that restaurants — as profit-generating businesses — place a great deal of effort into reducing their costs. And, some of these cost reduction tactics are not exactly, well, appetizing to say the least.Using a publication by The Guardian, our own personal experiences, and information we gathered from current restaurant workers, we’ve created a list of things some restaurants do to save money that they would never advertise on their menus.

http://news.yahoo.com/nypd-ambush-attack-why-police-accuse-mayor-having-141701306.html	NYPD ambush attack: Why police accuse mayor of having 'blood' on his hands	The violence that lead to the deaths of two New York police officers Saturday was blind.At 2:47 p.m., authorities say, a young black man angry at the police killings of Michael Brown and Eric Garner stepped onto a Brooklyn street corner to take his revenge. He men he killed were Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos – a man who had just been married two months before, and father of two described by a friend as "an amazing man. He was the best father and husband and friend."Amid a debate over police diversity, these two were an Asian and a Latino. Amid a debate over police brutality, these two were eating lunch, according to one report.Recommended: Are you a true Noo Yawker? Take our Big Apple quiz.The man connected to the Saturday's attacks, Ismaayil Brinsley, shot his girlfriend in the stomach earlier in the day, police say, and had warrants in Atlanta for probation violations related to theft, firearm possession, and criminal property damage charges. He committed suicide Saturday when police cornered him.Calling the shootings an "assassination," New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said: "It is an attack on all of us."But in the hours after the shooting, the tensions that have increasingly presented a picture of a New York divided rose to the surface.As Mayor de Blasio approached the podium to make his statement Saturday, cops turned their backs to him. After de Blasio spoke, police union chief Pat Lynch declared: "There's blood on many hands tonight. That blood on the hands starts at City Hall in the Office of the Mayor."The mayor, many police officials say, has betrayed them. He has not stood beside them as protesters have taken to the streets since the grand jury decision not to indict a police officer in Mr. Garner's death by an illegal chokehold. Worse, the mayor said in a press conference after the Garner grand jury decision that he has told his biracial son to "take special care" during police encounters.Some police had circulated a petition to request that de Blasio not come to their funeral if they were killed in the line of duty. Meanwhile, outside the hospital where the two cops had been brought Saturday, one Daily Beast reporter heard expletives yelled at the police and talked to a local man who said that some people were saying, "Serves them right because you mistreat people!"The emotions in New York are raw.Police are saying, "I told you so.""Unfortunately, I don't believe anyone connected to law enforcement is surprised this happened," Gary McLhinney, a negotiator for police unions, told The Washington Post. "When our leaders make statements that encourage lawlessness and demean an entire profession, this is the result."Supporters have started a #BlueLivesMatter hashtag, playing off the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag that sprung from the Brown case in Ferguson, Mo. Others started a New York counterprotest, wearing T-shirts that read "I can breathe" – playing off the "I can't breathe" T-shirts that have become a symbol of pro-Garner protests.But for one resident of the Brooklyn community where Saturday's tragedy happened, choosing between support for the police and support for the protests was a false choice."Now we have two families that's missing someone from the holidays," she told New York's WABC-TV. "Where's your sense of humanity?"The Rev. Al Sharpton, the man at the center of the Garner and Brown protests, who many police supporters see as an irresponsible rabble-rouser, said on Saturday: "Any use of the names of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, in connection with any violence or killing of police, is reprehensible and against the pursuit of justice in both cases."Between the visceral points of concern for police violence and concern for police safety are many difficult questions – honest questions about latent racism, and honest questions about out-of-control violence in some communities. Nineteenth-century abolitionist Frederick Douglass said people who wished to reach racial harmony without asking tough questions are "people who want crops without plowing the ground."Officers Liu and Ramos were not the face of that debate. They had nothing to do with Brown or Garner or the tide of events into which they were eventually swept.But perhaps now they will be that face.If Garner and Brown came to symbolize to a part of America the need to address the sometimes-dehumanizing way in which blacks are viewed, then perhaps Liu and Ramos will come symbolize what police have done right, and how much they are called to sacrifice to keep others safe.Said some Twitter users, perhaps it's not #BlackLivesMatter or #BlueLivesMatter, but both.#BlackLivesMatter#NYPDLivesMatter If you have an issue with *either* of those two hashtags, *you* are the problem.You.— Colm Flaherty (@CJayFla) December 21, 2014Related storiesAre you a true Noo Yawker?

http://www.vox.com/2014/10/30/7131905/obama-immigration-reform-how-what-immigrants-millions-plan	Obama ready to announce sweeping plans on immigration	Barack Obama will address the nation Thursday night to discuss his plans for immigration. The speech will coincide with the Latin Grammy Awards on Univision, which will cut away to air the president's address, thus guaranteeing excellent ratings among the Spanish language audience. It's thought that he will protect about 4 million unauthorized migrants from deportation. The broad contours of the plan are widely known (see below) but ambiguity remains around farm workers, and the precise scope of some other protected categories.Obama's planObama's anticipated plan is expected to include relief from deportation for millions of immigrants. The new program is likely to build on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program from 2012, which allowed young immigrants who would have benefited from the DREAM Act to apply for two years of protection from deportation, and for work permits.The plan's also going to include other elements, including further tweaks to immigration enforcement and a plan to expand legal immigration. But relief for unauthorized immigrants is the centerpiece — and the most controversial element.Here's what we know the White House is considering, and what looks likely to make it into the final package.(Erkan Avci/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)How many people could be covered?Estimates tend to be on the order of about 4 million, based on a New York Times report. Those 4 million newly-eligible immigrants would join the 1.2 million unauthorized immigrants who are currently eligible for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), making a total of 5 million unauthorized immigrants who'd be eligible for relief once the plan goes into effect. (It's worth noting that only about half of those eligible for DACA have actually applied for protection from deportation, so how many immigrants are eligible doesn't necessarily equal the number who are protected.)It all depends on who exactly is included in the new program, which no one knows for sure at this point.Immigration protesters. (John Moore/Getty Images)Which types of immigrants could be covered?The president's ability to protect unauthorized immigrants from deportation is supposed to be limited to particularly worthy cases. When the Obama administration instituted the DACA program in 2012, they justified it by saying that they were limiting the program to a particular group of immigrants — and then using the application process to evaluate individual cases.Similarly, for this round of immigration relief, the administration will probably carve out one or more groups of unauthorized immigrants who will be eligible to apply, and then set an additional set of criteria that individuals in those groups will have to meet to get their applications approved.Here are the groups that are most likely to be eligible under a new program:Unauthorized immigrants whose children are US citizens or green-card holders. There are 3.5 million unauthorized immigrants with US-citizen children (in most cases because their kids were born in the US). These immigrants should be eligible for legal status themselves, after their children turn 21. But they're blocked by rules that make it extremely difficult to get legal status in the US if you've ever been unauthorized — especially if you're not willing to risk leaving the US in the hopes that you might get to come back. Another 150,000 immigrants are parents of green-card holders, and would have to wait even longer — assuming their children didn't become citizens — to get legal status in the US.Unauthorized immigrants who came as children or teenagers — who aren't already protected from deportation. In 2012, Obama created the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which was intended to protect young unauthorized immigrants who would have qualified for the DREAM Act. The DACA program is limited to immigrants who arrived before 2007, and who were under the age of 30 when the program was announced. Expanding the program to older immigrants who arrived in the US as children, or to immigrant children and teenagers who arrived after 2007, could protect up to 300,000 more immigrants from deportation.Jeanette Vizguerra, a Colorado immigrant whose children are US citizens and who's been fighting her deportation.Here are a few other groups that haven't been mentioned in recent reports about the administration's plan — or about whom there are mixed reports:Possibly included: Unauthorized immigrants who are married to US citizens or green-card holders. There are 1.5 million unauthorized immigrants in the US whose spouses have US citizenship, or at least a green card. They should be eligible for legal status immediately, but are blocked by the same rules that make it so hard for unauthorized immigrant parents to get legal status. These haven't been mentioned in any reports yet, though there have been vague reports of other immigrants being protected "by other means."Uncertain of inclusion: Farmworkers. Historically, legalizing unauthorized farmworkers has been more popular with Congress than legalizing other unauthorized workers — a bill called "AgJOBS," to grant legal status to farmworkers, has been floating around Congress as long as the DREAM Act. On Wednesday, Politico reported that farmworkers weren't being included in the administration's plan — but the United Farm Workers claimed that 250,000 farmworkers would be protected from deportation.Probably not included: Other unauthorized immigrants with children. The Obama administration has said that immigration enforcement shouldn't split up families, and advocates believe that the only way to guarantee that is to protect parents from deportation. There are 900,000 unauthorized immigrants whose children are not citizens, but are under 18. The administration could also protect the parents of DACA recipients, which could cover several hundred thousand more unauthorized immigrants. But according to Politico, lawmakers who attended the Wednesday dinner with President Obama said that DREAMers' parents would not be included.People attend an orientation class in filing up their application for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. (Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images)What other requirements would an immigrant have to meet?Immigrants won't automatically qualify for legal status if they fit one of these categories. There are other criteria to consider as well. To qualify for DACA, for example, an immigrant has to meet a set of criteria regarding age, education, criminal record, and time in the United States. Not all of those will matter for other groups of immigrants (age requirements will likely be dropped) but others will.In particular, the administration is expected to require applicants to have been in the US for a certain number of years before they're eligible for relief. The DACA program required immigrants to have been in the US since at least 2007 — five years before the program went into effect. (That's why the current proposals include a plan to expand it to other immigrants who arrived as children after 2007.) By that standard, an estimated 3.3 million parents of US citizens or green-card holders would be eligible.The question is whether the White House will say that immigrants have to have been in the US for five years to be eligible for the new program, or whether it will require them to have been here for ten years. The higher standard could exclude 800,000 parents of US citizens or green-card holders. Furthermore, it's going to be extremely hard for immigrants to prove when they entered the country without papers.

http://news.yahoo.com/maine-hospital-observing-patient-possible-ebola-case-140129897.html	Maine hospital observing patient as possible Ebola case	By Dave SherwoodPORTLAND Maine (Reuters) - A patient in Portland, Maine, is being held for observation for a potential case of Ebola at the request of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, health officials said.No information about the patient, his condition or travels has been released by the hospital, and there is no confirmation of Ebola, according to Dr. August Valenti, an infectious disease specialist at Maine Medical Center. He said in a statement that the decision was a precautionary step."Maine Medical Center is using policies developed by the World Health Organization. Those policies exceed the policies of Center for Disease Control and represent the strictest of guidelines," Valenti said.Hospitals across the United States are on high alert as authorities continue to investigate how a nurse in an isolation ward at a hospital in Texas contracted Ebola, the first instance of a person contracting the disease on U.S. soil.Numerous other Ebola scares in the past week, including one in which passengers at Boston's Logan Airport were removed from an airplane that had arrived from Dubai, have turned out to be false alarms.Portland hospital officials said health workers there are using a higher level of protective apparel than that recommended by the CDC.The Maine hospital's response comes as medical experts, including CDC chief Dr. Thomas Frieden, have acknowledged a need to rethink how highly infectious diseases are handled in the United States.The current Ebola outbreak, the worst on record, has killed some 4,447 people, mostly in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea in West Africa.(Editing by Scott Malone and Doina Chiacu)
http://nationalinterest.org/feature/grave-threat-the-nato-alliance-its-not-russias-military-11661	A Grave Threat to the NATO Alliance (And It's Not Russia's Military)	Even as NATO adopts a confrontational policy toward Moscow reminiscent of the chilliest days of the Cold War, the Alliance faces multiple internal problems. Doubts remain about whether members are willing to match their strong rhetoric regarding Russia and other security challenges with substantive upgrades to their military capabilities. In the aftermath of the Kremlin’s annexation of Crimea and its continued support for secessionists in eastern Ukraine, promises of greater efforts surged, especially from Poland and the Baltic republics—the countries most at risk if Russia turns aggressively expansionist. But we’ve heard such promises before. At the 2006 NATO summit, all members pledged to devote at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product to defense. Eight years later, only the United States, Britain, Greece and Estonia among the twenty-eight member states fulfill that commitment. There is scant evidence that the new round of paper promises will fare any better.There are also major fissures within the Western camp about how to deal with Russia. Washington successfully pressured its allies to impose economic sanctions, but there is a noticeable lack of enthusiasm for that course among some NATO governments. Czech Republic prime minister Bohuslav Sobotka, for example, warns that while sanctions weaken Russia’s economy and harm ordinary Russians, they are unlikely to change the Kremlin’s behavior regarding Ukraine or other issues.Another development that has received less media attention, but could prove extremely disruptive to NATO is the emergence of ugly authoritarian trends in some members, especially Romania, Hungary and Turkey. Romania’s outgoing president, Traian Basescu, has accused his political rival and possible successor, Prime Minister Victor Ponta, of having been an undercover officer for the country’s spy agency in the late 1990s. It was merely the latest allegation of dubious conduct by prominent officials and opinion leaders in ostensibly democratic Romania.(You May Also Like: 5 Russian Weapons of War NATO Should Fear) Evidence of undemocratic behavior in Romania is mild, though, compared to developments in Hungary. U.S. officials are beginning to express alarm at the apparent authoritarianism and corruption enveloping Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s government. Orban has conducted a crackdown on human-rights groups that is not far removed from the behavior of Vladimir Putin’s regime. One of Orban’s targets is the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union, which, ironically, had supported him a decade ago when he was under fire from political opponents. Over the past few years, harassment of media outlets, civil organizations and other critics of Orban’s rule has steadily grown. In rhetoric reminiscent of Putin’s, Orban asserts that such groups are “paid political activists attempting to assert foreign interests in Hungary.” The prime minister now touts the alleged virtues of autocracy, citing China, Russia, Singapore and Turkey, as models of successful countries that Hungary should consider emulating.(What You May Like: Russia's Navy Rising) The situation in Turkey is even more troubling. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has conducted high-profile prosecutions of military leaders for allegedly plotting coups against the government, even when evidence for those allegations is exceedingly weak. As in Hungary, civil organizations and independent press outlets repeatedly find themselves under siege. Even one-time supporters of Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party are now castigated as enemies. At the end of October, Turkey’s National Security Council branded the Gulen Movement, once the government’s most powerful political ally, as a threat to national security. In an unusual procedure, Erdogan personally presided over the meeting at which that charge was adopted.The government’s heavy hand is evident in other respects. When prosecutors conducted a wide-ranging probe of corruption, leading to the resignation of four government ministers, Erdogan’s administration retaliated by “purg[ing] hundreds of police officials and prosecutors.” It pushed through laws giving the president even “tighter control over the judiciary.”(What You May Like: 5 NATO Weapons of War Russia Should Fear) Pages
http://gma.yahoo.com/see-joy-c-section-birth-empowering-photos-161306877--abc-news-parenting.html	See the 'Joy' of C-Section Birth in These 'Empowering' Photos	Read any message board aimed at pregnant women, and the reader will soon come away with the impression that a C-section, even when it's recommended by a doctor, isn't a good way to give birth.Or at least, certainly not as good as a vaginal birth.Take this post from a mom’s Facebook page today. "Can anyone recommend an acupuncturist that turns breech babies? Want to avoid a c-section."Several responses included suggestions of a "version," short for External Cephalic Version, or having a doctor apply pressure from the outside in an attempt to turn a breech baby.One woman describes her baby-turning and avoidance of a Caesarean section, or surgical birth, as "such a relief."Canadian photographer Jessica Bender said that prior to shooting her friend's C-section, she shared some of the same feelings. She thought a C-section was "something to be feared, something fiercely medical, and antiseptic; not the organic picture of birth most of us have in our minds when we are pregnant. A C-section was always something to be avoided, and framed as, ‘Oh, she couldn’t deliver vaginally,” as if it was a failure on the woman’s part," Bender told ABC News.The Victoria, British Columbia-based photographer -- a newborn and baby specialist -- had shot several vaginal births in the past but never thought she would have the opportunity to attend a C-section because of strict rules regarding the number of people in the room during the surgery.But when her friend's husband was unexpectedly unable to be at the birth of his child, Bender jumped at the chance to be there for her friend and document the experience."When I was thinking about the images, and what I wanted to focus on, I realized that I wanted to capture an empowering C-section delivery,” she said. “Carly [the mother] was without fear, and so excited to meet her baby, which made it easy for me to create images of calm, and tranquility.”"When I was thinking about the images, and what I wanted to focus on, I realized that I wanted to capture an empowering C-section delivery.""Taking these photos erased any fear I had. I saw another way to welcome a baby into this world. One that relied on skilled medical professionals, and technology that we are so fortunate to have. "Feedback to the photos, Bender said, has been mostly positive. "When Carly and I decided to share the photos, it was our intention to remove some fear and stigma around C-sections, so to see that we have had some success in this makes us both feel absolutely amazing." Carly Bird gave birth to baby boy Elias."These images are for moms who find themselves with a C-section delivery, to help them see what it looks like, that it doesn’t have to be scary, it can still be everything they wanted meeting their baby for the first time to be. These images are about birth, joy, and becoming a family."

The company posted third quarter sale losses of 7% in the US and 15% internationally, Buzzfeed reports. According to the company, sales are "below expectations" in the wake of a brand revamp that basically involved throwing out its entire sales strategy from the early 2000s.Its lower-priced sister brand Hollister is doing even worse. According to the company, Hollister's sales have continued to decline when compared to Abercrombie, even though the brand recently underwent a changing of the guard when former Ann Taylor Loft president Fran Horowitz was brought on board to try to turn things around.

Is there even chicken in here?According to McDonald's, the answer is still yes, as stated in yet another video in the fast-food chain's transparency campaign. In the new video, similar to the one on how McRibs are made, host Grant Imahara ventures to Tyson Foods in Tennessee to get the inside scoop for viewers.The video touches on some pretty tough subjects, like those nasty pink slime accusations McDonald's faced in 2012, and Imahara's nearly perfect description of how people think Chicken Nuggets are made: "People think that you just come to this giant factory, you have a bin of chickens that you just put into a grinder, you grind 'em up and you pour that into a mold, [squeezing noise] and that's what you use to make a Chicken McNugget."Here are some important moments in the video:1. Shots of the workers slicing up chicken2. When we saw something that looked like pink slime3. When we met "the machine that combines all of the ingredients together"4. This comparison of pink slime to the final products5. Seeing nuggets get breaded and battered6. Getting a final look at the nuggets before they get flash frozen7. When Imahara grinned like the world's greatest mystery had been solvedThough we applaud McDonald's for trying to be transparent and promoting their nuggets as natural -- we can't help but be skeptical of this video (also suspiciously released the day we learned of more declining sales for the brand).

http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2013/10/15/rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-nominees-nirvana-kiss-nwa-linda-ronstadt/2976391/	Nirvana, Kiss among Rock Hall nominees	Sixteen nominees make the first cut on the road to induction in 2014.Twenty-five years after asking fans if they could feel the band's "love buzz," Nirvana is nominated for Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction.It's the first year that the influential grunge rockers have been eligible for consideration, joining the ranks of other first-time nominees such as Linda Ronstadt, Peter Gabriel, Hall & Oates and Yes.Also on the ballot are returning favorites from last year such as Chic, Deep Purple and The Meters, along with hip-hop luminaries N.W.A. and LL Cool J.It's a diverse field, one that will likely see fan support swell behind beloved acts such as Kiss and Nirvana, and spark debates over the inclusion of Chic and Hall & Oates, who may not seem like textbook examples of rock artists. "This year's nominees represent the broad definition of 'rock 'n' roll' and include an array of artists whose fans are deeply passionate about the possibility of induction," says Joel Peresman, president and CEO of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation.For a second year, the public will be given a chance to participate in the selection process, and can cast votes through Dec. 10 at USA TODAY, Rolling Stone, and the official Rock Hall site.The top five artists, as selected by the masses, will make up a fans' ballot, a single vote in choosing the 2014 inductees.An artist or band becomes eligible for a nomination 25 years after releasing a debut single or album, meaning that the 2014 nominees released their first recording no later than 1988.Inductees will be determined by the hall's voting body of roughly 600 artists, historians and music industry professionals. The performers who receive the highest number of votes will be inducted April 10 in New York. The ceremony will be broadcast on HBO at a later date. (Note: Voting works best on Google Chrome and Firefox.)This year's hopefuls:The Paul Butterfield Blues Band. The Chicago band, powered by Butterfield on harmonica and Mike Bloomfield on guitar, led '60s rock lovers to the wellspring of Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf.Chic. With dance-floor classics like Le Freak and Good Times, Nile Rodgers and company gave disco a brilliant, soulful upgrade and influenced generations of pop and rap artists.Deep Purple. The British quintet, which helped define the heavy metal genre with its organ-driven thick sound and early covers of Hush and Kentucky Woman, hijacked the charts with Smoke On the Water and Woman From Tokyo.Peter Gabriel. The former Genesis frontman brought funky, synth-infused flavor to hits such as Sledgehammer and Shock the Monkey, but arguably made his biggest impact with the powerful, anti-apartheid anthem Biko.Hall & Oates. With smooth vocal harmonies soaring over rich, pop-rock melodies, Daryl Hall and John Oates brought rhythm & blues to the top of the charts, scoring smash singles such as I Can't Go for That (No Can Do), Private Eyes and You Make My Dreams.Kiss. Instantly recognized for their flashy attire and black-and-white face paint, these iconic heavy-metal rockers are best known for their Alive!, Love Gun and Destroyer albums, as well as their reputation for putting on dazzling, pyrotechnic-laden performances.LL Cool J. Before he appeared on Brad Paisley's Accidental Racist, this New York-bred rapper climbed the charts with his sentimental ballad I Need Love, and went on to influence Michael Jackson.Nirvana. Led by late singer/guitarist Kurt Cobain, this grunge-rock trio cemented its place in rock history with early '90s hits such as Lithium, Heart-Shaped Box and Smells Like Teen Spirit.N.W.A. Dr. Dre's ambitious, angry rap group, dubbed The Beatles of hip-hop, electrified fans, stunned city fathers and attracted the FBI's attention with gangsta rap classic F--- Tha Police and aggressive albums Straight Outta Compton and N-----4Life.Link Wray. Inspiring Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix and Bruce Springsteen, the late rocker's 1958 hit Rumble introduced the power chord to future generations of guitarists and musicians.The Meters.The iconic New Orleans funk ensemble and house band for Allen Toussaint's Sansu label recorded Cissy Strut, Look-Ka Py Py and many tunes with Dr. John.The Replacements. This Minnesota-bred band never scored a hit single, but they are considered alternative-rock pioneers by many, notably influencing popular punk-rock outfits such as Green Day and the Goo Goo Dolls.Linda Ronstadt. At the forefront of the folk- and country-rock movements, this full-voiced beauty made a name for herself covering Roy Orbison's Blue Bayou and Betty Everett's You're No Good.Cat Stevens. One of the biggest-selling artists of the early '70s, the mellow British songsmith crafted introspective, tranquil tunes such as Peace Train, Wild World and The First Cut Is the Deepest.Yes. Largely responsible for bringing progressive rock to the mainstream, these symphonic, experimental Englishmen are often seen as the forefathers to other beloved, synth-heavy bands such as Rush and Dream Theater.The Zombies. Famed for hazy vocals accompanied by psychedelic guitar riffs and jazz-inflected electric piano, their Odessey and Oracle album was ranked one of the 100 all-time greatest by Rolling Stone.Contributing: Edna Gundersen<!--iframe-->Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1gjc5Lf

But our stupid meatshells are actually working overtime to juggle ridiculously complicated tasks behind the scenes. They're truly wonderful machines, so let's take a minute to appreciate the fact that ...#5. Your Kidneys Are Literally Tasting Your Pee for ToxinsThinkstock Images/Stockbyte/Getty, Stockbyte/Stockbyte/Getty ImagesTaste and smell receptors don't just exist in your face. For the past decade or so, scientists have been discovering, to their surprise, that these specialized cells are actually found in tissues and organs all over your body, like the kidneys, heart, spine, respiratory tract, and even red blood cells. They initially wrote it off as a case of bodily confusion, but now they have a more interesting theory: your entire body is constantly smelling and tasting the world around you. That last sentence reads like either madness or the setup for a gory body-horror movie, but it may be true.AnaBGD/iStock/Getty Images The appropriate reaction.Take your kidneys, for example: Scent receptors are found within a tight grouping of cells called the macula densa. This region regulates blood filtration rates and therefore urine production, but the presence of these receptors suggests that it's literally smelling and/or tasting your piss as a form of chemical analysis. That's right: Your kidneys are super freaky.plepann/iStock/Getty Images "Yeah, that wasn't tea ..."Even your blood can smell things. In an experiment, scientists put blood cells on one side of a chamber and an aromatic compound that reacted with their scent receptors on the other, and watched in fascination (or perhaps abject horror) as the blood moved toward the scent. Getting more Cronenbergian by the minute here, aren't we? Well hold on, because it gets weirder:You know what can also smell? Sperm.Eraxion/iStock/Getty Images "Guys, smell that? I think we went the wrong way."And not just "like a teenager's bedroom" either. It's suggested that sperm use smell receptors to hunt out a woman's egg like bloodhounds. Now picture a penis firing out a billion tiny writhing creatures, each hungrily huffing the air around them, trying to track down what they all collectively want.Supersize that scene, slap some spikes on it, and you got a pretty solid sequel to The Thing.#4. There are 1,000 Times More Synapses in Your Brain Than There Are Stars in Our Galaxyjanulla/iStock/Getty Images, isak55/iStock/Getty ImagesFor a while, scientists estimated that there were 100 billion neurons in the human brain. This theory was debunked when they did a direct study -- which involved tossing brains into a blender and then subjecting the goop to microscopic analysis -- and found that the number is closer to only 86 billion. Great. We're a bunch of idiots. Thanks for confirming that one, science.But then there's our synapses, the connections between neurons, which snap together like thinky Legos to create the immense network that is the human mind. The total number of these synapses is a mind-boggling 100 trillion. A number that's 1,000 times greater than the total amount of stars found within our Milky Way galaxy.Svisio/iStock/Getty Images This one reminds you to clear your browser history.At a rate of 20 million billion calculations per second, your brain makes world-class computers look as technologically advanced as a drinking bird. To put things in perspective, Japanese and German scientists in 2013 tried to build a machine that could simulate the computing power encased in your skull. Using the power of 82,944 processors, they were actually able to achieve something approaching the computing power of one second in the human brain. It took them 40 minutes.RIKEN They best they could achieve was something resembling a terrible video game launch day.And yet here you are, reading a comedy website in one window with 16 tabs of sloth memes in the other. It's like having a Large Hadron Collider in your kitchen and using it to make toast.#3. Your Hearing Is So Sensitive, It Can Distinguish TemperatureCJ_Romas/iStock/Getty Images, zwolafasola/iStock/Getty ImagesEvolution has fine-tuned every aspect of our ears to assure survival in a world once dominated by saber-toothed cats and fist-toothed ... mammoths. We don't know, this isn't history class.Back to the ear: First of all, that weird shape, with all those folds and creases, isn't just wrinkly evolutionary gibberish -- the various lumps and grooves of your ear actually guide sound waves in such a way as to let you identify the direction of the predator sneaking up on you.Satyabrata Sen and Arye Nehorai "He's using the trees ..."Not surprised yet? How about this: you can actually hear temperature. Yes, that's a combination of words we just put together. No, we're not high. Or no more so than usual, anyway.That's the claim put forward by British advertising firm Condiment Junkie (not exactly our first stop for science), who did an experiment to see whether participants could determine the difference between hot and cold tea being poured into a glass by listening to the sound alone. According to their results, a whopping 96 percent of the volunteers involved correctly guessed the temperature of the beverage. That may not be just Condiment Junkies making shit up because they're still delusional from last night's mustard high. Some believe this phenomenon is due to differences in viscosity between the liquids. The molecules squirming within a cold liquid are less energetic, idling about and "sticking" to each other, whereas the hot molecules zip about readily and allow for a smoother pour. And your crazy super ears are so fine-tuned, they can hear how lazy molecules are.plepann/iStock/Getty Images "At least we think that's tea. You taste it."Next

Superior Court on Thursday.The lawsuit was filed under a pseudonym, Jane Doe. The woman is seeking $5 million in compensatory damages and $10 million in punitive damages.LAWSUIT: Read the full complaintSimon, 32, is in his third season with the Reds. He signed with the Philadelphia Phillies as an amateur free agent in 1999 and made his major-league debut with the Baltimore Orioles in 2008, pitching for them in parts of four seasons. He was acquired by the Reds on waivers in April 2012 and is making $1.5 million this season."The allegations are totally baseless," Simon's lawyer, Jack Quinn, told USA TODAY Sports. "Mr. Simon will defend this matter fully and will be totally exonerated."The Reds declined comment.Steve Kelly, a lawyer at Silverman, Thompson, Slutkin & White, LLC in Baltimore who is representing the woman, said he worked to gather facts on the case and discussed a resolution with Simon's attorney before filing the lawsuit."She knows this is going to be an incredibly traumatic event. It already has been," Kelly said. "You would never subject yourself to that had it not been for a real concern for the potential for this happening to other people."The Reds were in Washington D.C. starting April 25, 2013, for a four-game series against the Nationals.According to the complaint, the woman met Simon at The Huxley nightclub on April 27. Kevin Verdin, a man claiming to be Simon's manager, spoke to the woman and her friends and offered them tickets to the Reds-Nationals game the next day.He introduced the woman to Reds pitcher Johnny Cueto and Simon, who bought her drinks and then said, "We are getting out of here," before hailing a taxi to take them to the Mayflower Renaissance Hotel. According to the complaint, the woman was "visibly intoxicated" and unable to consent.Simon and the woman arrived around 2:30 a.m. and began kissing, the complaint says."However, Defendant abruptly changed his behavior from a romantic encounter to a terrifying physical attack," the complaint says. "As soon as Defendant started to get rough with her, Jane Doe told him to stop. Defendant ignored that plea, pinning Jane Doe down on her stomach while she struggled and continued to demand Defendant stop and get off her."According to the complaint and the police report the woman filed with Metro Police four days later, Simon tried unsuccessfully to force his penis in the woman's vagina. He then forced his penis into her rectum, "causing Plaintiff to cry out in unbearable physical pain as he continued to rape her anally," the complaint says.After the alleged assault, the woman returned to The Huxley and told her roommate. A rape kit taken later that morning revealed anal tears, abrasions and protruding tissue, according to the complaint."I don't know how those injuries happen without severe force," said Bridgette Harwood, an attorney for the woman and the co-executive director and director of legal services for the Network for Victim Recovery of DC.According to emails obtained by USA TODAY Sports, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia received the report and started to investigate about 24 hours after the woman reported to police on May 2.The woman testified before a grand jury on May 9, according to Harwood. On May 15, assistant U.S. attorney Sharon Donovan informed the woman's attorney that a decision had been made and scheduled a meeting for the next day.There she explained that her office would not be pursuing charges in the case, said Harwood."It's definitely one of those cases you just can't seem to wrap your mind around it, for me and the advocate," said Harwood. "While I understand their position, I think I would have made a different decision."Harwood said she asked if the prosecutor had polled the grand jury and was told the decision not to file charges was made by the U.S. Attorney's Office."I do think she felt like the prosecutors believed her," said Harwood. "I think she wanted them to have the goal to go forward even if they felt they might lose."Metro Police did not respond to USA TODAY Sports' messages for comment on Thursday.Bill Miller, Public Information Officer for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, said in a statement: "We have no comment. ... Generally speaking, however, we note that the U.S. Attorney's Office works closely with the Metropolitan Police Department and other law enforcement partners and thoroughly investigates allegations of sexual assault."The woman, 28, has since left her job as a social worker for at-risk children in D.C. and returned home to live with her mother. Harwood said the woman was not aware of her options to pursue the case in civil court, where there is a lower preponderance of evidence standard, until she notified her client."She struggled so much with wanting to forget and pretend like this never happened and this external pressure of, 'I owe this to other people not to let him do this to someone else,'" said Harwood.Simon was previously acquitted of an involuntary manslaughter charge in his native Dominican Republic.He was accused in the New Year's 2011 shooting death of Michel Castillo Almonte, 25, as Simon and others fired shots in the air in celebration. Then a pitcher for the Baltimore Orioles, Simon spent three months in jail during the investigation.At the time of his acquittal, Simon's attorney said prosecution witnesses said they did not see Simon fire a gun and that the bullet taken from Castillo Almonte's body did not match Simon's gun.Simon is 3-1 with a 1.30 ERA in four starts for the Reds this season. He last pitched Wednesday, allowing two runs over 6 2/3 innings as the Reds beat the Pirates in Pittsburgh.Contributing: Steve Berkowitz and Bob Nightengale
http://www.voanews.com/content/china-us-leaders-to-meet-in-beijing/2510317.html	China, US Leaders to Meet in Beijing	Leaders of 21 Asian nations will meet in Beijing in the coming days for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit.  President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry will meet with Chinese leaders amidst a changed political landscape from when Obama and China’s President Xi Jinping met more than one year ago. In a speech before his trip to Asia, Kerry said U.S.-China relations are the most consequential in the world.  "Let me [be] clear.  The U.S. will never shy away from articulating our deeply held values or defending our interests, allies and partners throughout the region.  And China is well aware of that," he said. "But the relationship between our two countries has developed and matured over time."President Obama and President Xi are expected to meet for bilateral talks later next week.The summit between them comes just after midterm elections in the United States, in which Republicans won control of the Senate, curbing President Obama’s ability to push his legislative agenda.An editorial in Thursday’s state-run Global Times newspaper said the vote was a referendum on Obama’s political achievements, and now the president will “have to swallow the bitterest pill.”   The editorial said that the Republican-controlled Congress could take a tougher line against Beijing.Seeking transparencyDespite China’s growing influence, Kerry this week said Washington will not shy away from confronting China on issues of human rights, and the ongoing pro-democracy protests still simmering in Hong Kong.   "The United States will always advocate for all countries to permit their citizens to express their grievances publicly and peacefully and without fear of retribution.  That is why we have spoken out about the situation in Hong Kong and human rights issues, because respect for fundamental freedoms is now and always has been a centerpiece of American foreign policy," said Kerry.Following the APEC summit, a key test for U.S. China relations will be achieving consensus on climate change.  Leaders will meet again in one year in Paris to set targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2020.

Following a public comment period, the Federal Trade Commission has approved a final order resolving FTC allegations that Google, Inc., unfairly billed consumers for in-app charges incurred by children without their parents’ consent.The settlement was first announced by the Commission in September. It resolves allegations that Google billed consumers millions of dollars for charges incurred by children without consent from account holders.When Google first introduced in-app charges to the Google Play store in 2011, the FTC’s complaint alleged, Google billed for such charges without any password requirement or other method to obtain account holder authorization.The complaint also alleged that even after requiring a password to incur in-app charges, the company failed to tell parents that entering the password would then open a 30-minute window during which children could make unlimited charges without authorization.The settlement requires Google to provide full refunds of unauthorized in-app charges incurred by children and to modify its billing practices to obtain express, informed consent from consumers before billing them for in-app charges. If the company gets consumers’ consent for future charges, consumers must have the option to withdraw their consent at any time.In addition, Google is required to contact all consumers who had an in-app charge to inform them of the refund process for unauthorized in-app charges by children within 15 days of the order being finalized.Google must make these refunds promptly, upon request from an account holder. Should the company provide less than $19 million in refunds within a year of the settlement’s approval, the company will be required to remit the balance to the Commission for use in providing additional remedies to consumers or for return to the U.S. Treasury.The Commission vote approving the final order and response letters to commenters was 4-0-1, with Commissioner Wright recused.

http://www.aol.com/article/2014/11/21/bill-cosbys-traveling-circus-to-make-stop-in-florida-sex-assault-accusation/20997393/	Bill Cosby's traveling circus to make stop in Florida as ANOTHER sex assault accusation is made	The Bill Cosby comedy empire is crumbling, and it looks like Florida might be the beleaguered comedian's last stand.Cosby's management team said Friday his scheduled show in Melbourne, Florida, will go on. The announcement came as other venues scrambled to cancel shows after yet another woman stepped forward to claim Cosby drugged and assaulted her.Shows in Las Vegas, Arizona and Illinois have been cancelled, but Friday night's show at the King Center for the Performing Arts will go on.Renita Chaney Hill, 47, told KDKA that she was only 15-years-old when she met Cosby back in the 1980s. An aspiring model and actress at the time, she claims to have been star struck by the legendary comedian.The Cos was in Steel City seeking recruits for the "Picture Pages" educational segments that aired on television back then, according to Hill."Promises of bright lights and fame. That's where I thought I was headed, that's what everyone who knew me thought I was headed," Hill told the station.Hill began appearing in Cosby's videos, and soon after, found herself in his hotel room where she was drugged and likely assaulted, she recalled.Cosby, now 77-years-old, flew her around the country to meet him in his hotel room at night, she said."One time, I remember just before I passed out, I remember him kissing and touching me and I remember the taste of his cigar on his breath, and I didn't like it," Hill said."I remember another time when I woke up in my bed the next day and he was leaving, he mentioned you should probably lose a little weight. I thought that odd, how would he know that?"The then-underage teen remembers feeling confused about blacking out and waking up in her bed. She is not sure she was raped because she was always unconscious."It just felt weird to me, and I remember being in high school saying to him, 'I'll come see you, but I don't want to drink because it makes me feel funny,'" Hill continued. "And he would tell me that if I didn't drink, I couldn't come see him."At 19, she cut off all communications with Cosby.This is the latest in a tsunami of sex assault allegations to hit the showbiz legend in recent weeks, all sparked by an October appearance by comedian Hannibal Buress, in Cosby's hometown Philadelphia, in which Buress brought the star's sordid past back in to the limelight."You're a rapist," Buress said of Cosby.More than a dozen women have since come forward with details supporting Buress' claim.Cosby has repeatedly denied the accusations through lawyers and spokespersons. He also had a bizarre, rambling exchange with an AP reporter who nervously stood his ground when the comedian appeared to threaten his career if the footage was made public.The embattled septuagenarian has since seen an NBC project scuttled, a Netflix special postponed and sold-out shows around the country being cancelled.The three latest dominoes to fall are a show at an Arizona casino; another at Treasure Island, in Las Vegas; and a third scheduled for April at the Virginia Theater, in Champaign.Cosby was, until recently, one of the country's most beloved performers, an unstoppable juggernaut.His legacy is now disappearing faster than a Jell-O pudding pop on a hot summer day.November 21, 2014, at the King Performing Arts Center: Remember the date and location – it may be Cosby's last stand.

She also moved in on some of the most familiar claims launched against Azalea’s career — that she’s the music industry’s move in on what Nicki Minaj already was able to accomplish as a black woman: a female pop-star/rapper.And the media needs to STOP trying to move igloo in on what Nicki has established. — AZEALIA ⚓️ BANKS (@AZEALIABANKS) December 4, 2014Nicki is a hard-working rap-BEAST. stop trying to degrade and BELITTLE Our culture with this fucking kkk iggy shit. — AZEALIA ⚓️ BANKS (@AZEALIABANKS) December 4, 2014After Iggy logged on to find more than 10 tweets directed at her from from Azealia, she threw back her own wallop of 160 character slams, as well as noting that she didn’t feel Banks’ intentions were to bring light to the issue, but just to tarnish Azalea herself. In fact, much of Iggy’s response centered on how she felt that the other Azealia’s attack on her had more to do with press than Eric Garner, saying that there were better ways to help than mobilize Twitter followers — and even provided some ways that her own followers could.Theres more to sparking a change than trolling on social media. World issues shouldnt be used as a poor excuse to promote fan battles. — IGGY AZALEA (@IGGYAZALEA) December 4, 2014Make sure you do something to let YOUR government know how you feel when something is unjust., not JUST your followers on twitter… — IGGY AZALEA (@IGGYAZALEA) December 4, 2014CLEARLY your CONCERN is finding any reason to promote shade, trolling, fan fights and memes. I know you guys by now, you don’t fool me. — IGGY AZALEA (@IGGYAZALEA) December 4, 2014Banks, however, was back at it again a few hours later, bringing up an old Azealia Vs. Azalea battle from back when Iggy made the XXL Magazine list of most promising hip-hop artists over Banks in 2012, reported MStarz. At that time, Azealia called out some of Iggy’s lyrics that she thought were racist, the exact point she brought up as the Twitter war to a close last night.BUT… who told you that that is what black women act like?? Who let you into the runaway slave masters club?

http://news.yahoo.com/crime-lawsuits-cloud-american-sniper-movie-000020633--finance.html	Crime and lawsuits cloud new 'American Sniper' movie	By Marice RichterDALLAS (Reuters) - The real-life story behind Hollywood's "American Sniper," rolled out this holiday season, has been a dark tale of lawsuits and a pending murder trial for the man accused of gunning down the movie's hero.Iraq War veteran Eddie Ray Routh is to stand trial in February on charges of murdering Chris Kyle, the former Navy SEAL whose best-selling autobiography "American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History" was the basis for the film from director Clint Eastwood and starring Bradley Cooper.Prosecutors recently said they are not seeking the death penalty against Routh, who could face life in prison if convicted, said Warren St. John, one of Routh's court-appointed attorneys."Our guy is not evil," said St. John, adding that the defense will argue that Routh is insane.Kyle apparently saw Routh as a troubled veteran in need of help.View gallery Eddie Ray Routh is pictured in this booking photo provided by the Erath County Sheriff’s Office. Rou …After leaving the Navy in 2009, Kyle, a Texas native, settled in suburban Dallas and became president of Craft International, a tactical training company that was also dedicated to helping wounded veterans.Kyle was credited with 150 confirmed kills in Iraq and Afghanistan, a record that earned him regard as the most deadly sniper in Navy history.Kyle and his friend, Chad Littlefield, took Routh to a shooting range on Dec. 2, 2013. Routh is accused of shooting Kyle and Littlefield to death and stealing Kyle's truck.Routh was apprehended that day, charged with capital murder and remains in the Erath County Jail on $3 million bond. His family says he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and had been hospitalized at a mental institution.Kyle's estate has also had its troubles, with a jury in St. Paul earlier this year awarding former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura $1.8 million in damages for a passage in Kyle's book about a supposed bar fight between the two that jurors found libelous.This month, Ventura sued the book's publisher, HarperCollins, seeking an unspecified amount in damages for what he claims is unjust enrichment and defamation.Kyle's widow, Taya, said the film felt "natural" in that it got the story right. "The atrocity of it is that it is two really good men who were helping somebody," she told Dallas broadcaster WFAA.(This story corrects name in final paragraph to Taya from Tayla)(Writing by Jon Herskovitz; Editing by Dan Grebler)

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/anonymous-hacker-hector-monsegur-turned-fbi-informant-breaks-silence/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17	Anonymous hacker Hector Monsegur turned FBI informant breaks silence	Anonymous is one of the biggest online vigilante groups. Its members hack into companies and governments computer systems, and they prefer a life in the shadows, wearing masks in protests.Now, a former top member is breaking his silence.He helped carry out cyberattacks that caused $50 million in damages. In his first television interview, Hector Monsegur opens up about his arrest, and switching sides, reports "CBS This Morning" co-host Charlie Rose.Play Video CBS This Morning How former hacker Hector "Sabu" Monsegur got arrested by FBI Monsegur, an FBI informant who used to be one of the top hackers of Anonymous, shares how he knew the FBI was on his trail."Tinkering with the system and learning how it functioned, I was able to escape," Monsegur said. "Escape from the current situation we were goin' through."Monsegur said he taught himself everything he knows."You know everybody around me were into something, but it wasn't computers," he said.From the moment Monsegur got his hands on a used desktop, he had a passion for computers.But for the boy raised by his grandmother in this New York City housing project, it was the internet that provided a gateway to something bigger."We were poor, so I needed to find a way that would be cheap or free so that I could be able to access the internet without being a burden to my grandmother," Monsegur said.According to court documents, at first he stole credit card information, selling the numbers or using them to pay his own bills.Monsegur eventually adopted the name "Sabu" and joined a mysterious group of hackers about to take off.Play Video CBS This Morning Former Anonymous hacker Hector Monsegur on future plans Monsegur, an FBI informant who used to be one of the top hackers of Anonymous, has served time in prison and helped authorities stop hundreds of ..."Anonymous is an idea. An idea where we could all be anonymous," Monsegur said. "We could all work together as a crowd -- united -- we could rise and fight against oppression."As Anonymous grew, Monsegur helped take the movement to a worldwide level.At the height of the Arab Spring in Tunisia, he hijacked the prime minister's website, posting a letter in support of protesters."It was amazing. I saw finally I was able to do something that contributed to society regardless if I was at home in the Lower East Side, in the projects, behind a computer," Monsegur said.Monsegur admitted he was behind thousands of hacks.While working with Anonymous and his own off-shoot group, Lulzsec, some of his targets included Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, Sony, and the U.S. Senate.While he recognized that hacking is illegal, Monsegur said he wasn't worried about getting caught."After you're hacking for so long you reach a point of no return," he said. "Regardless if you fear that they're gonna get you one day, it's too late."In June 2011, Monsegur led a brazen attack on the website of InfraGard, an FBI affiliate. Days later, a team of FBI agents showed up at the same apartment where he grew up."So he said, 'Well, we know who you are, we know what you're doin', and we also know you have two kids in the house. You make the decision,' he recalled. "So it's clear as day they had an understanding that my weakness was the kids."He immediately chose to work as an FBI informant to avoid the possibility of serving up to 124 years in prison.For the next three years -- he continued communicating with fellow hackers. Only now, every keystroke was logged. The FBI said he has helped them prevent more than 300 cyberattacks in systems controlled by the military and NASA, for example."I was able to intercept attacks that were happening against the government and -- share it with the government so they could fix these issues," Monsegur said.He also played a key role in the arrests of a group of co-conspirators, seven of whom pleaded guilty, including the FBI's most wanted cybercriminal Jeremy Hammond.Some fellow "hacktivists" saw Monsegur's cooperation as the ultimate betrayal and labeled him a rat."It wasn't a situation where I identified anybody. I didn't point my fingers at nobody," he said. "My cooperation entailed logging and providing intelligence. It didn't mean, 'Can you please tell me the identity of one of your mates?'"He insisted the hackers wouldn't even divulge that information because members in the group remain, as the name suggests, anonymous.Monsegur's talent and keen eye highlighted vulnerabilities in the critical systems that keep America online -- threats he said still exist."In all reality there is no security," Monsegur said. "Hackers could break right into the airport, the phone systems, obviously, the water supply systems -- shut them down."While it sounds frightening, Monsegur said it should be an inspiration to the American government to take action and focus on the country's infrastructure."We have a sickening reliance on security contractors, the companies that Edward Snowden worked for," Monsegur said. "Who will guard the guards, Charlie? Our security, the people we pay for, the people we hire with tax dollars -- are not really secure themselves."Earlier this year, Monsegur was sentenced to time served.On the day his cooperation was made public, Anonymous suggested it was indestructible, tweeting: "Anonymous is a hydra, cut off one head and we grow two back." Monsegur's family was threatened and he remains cautious."If I were to go back I would remain a political hacktivist -- activist hacker -- however, I would stay away from Anonymous," he said. "It was just too much publicity."Had his youth been different, had he had better opportunities, his skills could have landed him amongst many other tech wunderkinds in Silicon Valley."Well, that's the problem. I didn't end up in Silicon Valley. I had no connections to the world," he said. "I guarantee you, though, had I made it to Silicon Valley, had I met you when I was 18, you probably could have pointed me in the right direction. You and I would be having a completely different discussion."

However, movie spoilers continue to leak ahead of the film's U.S. release on Dec. 18, 2015.  This time a look back at the desert location of the movie gives a glimpse of what could happen at Tatooine.Jason Ward over at Makingstarwars has once again shared some interesting details about the desert set of "Star Wars: The Force Awakens." Taking queue from the movie's painted storyboards, Ward claims the desert plains of Tatooine will include a Darth Vader scene where the Incendiary Troopers are involved.The Tatooine scene will reportedly start with a ship landing on the desert. This ship supposedly looks like a mix between an Imperial Shuttle and a Sandcrawler. The storyboard allegedly shows the ship with guns on its short wings and a ramp resembling the Imperial Shuttle's ramp.  This ship according to Ward is seen landing on a village resembling that on the photo leaked in August by Cinelinx.  The ship opens and two Stormtroopers and a figure cloaked in black ascend. According to Ward what happens next shows the huts in the village in flames. More Stormtroopers have apparently taken over the village. They "continue to advance with flamethrowers burning the village, " Ward said. However, one of the Stormtroopers is seen on the ground bleeding as signs of resistance begin."Lasers whip past their helmets, depicting fierce resistance," Ward said. Its believed the Wickermans are the resistance the Imperial Forces are dealing with. They reportedly have sniper riffles which could explain the lasers firing back at the Stormtroopers. Makingstarwars describes the Wickermans as scary-looking aliens with "white, skeletal, black eye sockets with little pin points or eyes." Its head looks "pointed but where a hair line would begin, there's pointy wicker like brambles sticking straight up." The alien posesses a sniper rifle with a scope on it and its barrel looking like it has a rocket on it.Despite the resistance, the villagers are said to be of no match to the Stormtroopers. According to Ward, the Tatooine storyboard for "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" shows the entire village in flames as the "Incendiary Troopers have done their work well." Likewise, the cloacked figure, who is depicted as the villain Darth Vader, is seen standing from a distance. He is seen with several Stormtroopers watching Tatooine huts burn to the sand.Ward supposed 'Darth Vader' and the Stormtroopers were out to hunt for John Boyega's character in Tatooine. As previously reported by the International Business Times, "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" could feature the actor as an Imperial Soldier. He has supposedly gone AWOL and is being hunted down by his commander. Its believed his TIE Fighter was gunned down over at Tatooine. But the Wickermans have succesfully hid it from sight as they were scavening the desert.Additionally Ward claims the attack on Tatooine would also "put Kira on her path with no turning back when the life she once knew is burned to the ground." It's believed the destruction on Tatooine would awaken the force inside Daisy Ridley's rumoured character.

Lady Gaga is threatening to sue a British ice cream company The Licktators for manufacturing a human breast milk-based ice cream called “Royal Baby Gaga.” While her reps have declined to comment on the matter, Gaga’s attorneys have reportedly sent a cease and desist to the company citing trademark infringement.The New York Daily News reports:In a cease and desist letter sent last week, the “Bad Romance” singer claimed the London-based company is riding her raw meat-festooned coattails by using her moniker on the bizarre treat without her consent, The Mirror reported.

http://news.yahoo.com/one-iphone-6-most-important-features-just-confirmed-130524553.html	One of the iPhone 6’s most important new features was just confirmed in a massive leak	What do you see when you look at the images above? At first glance, they might not appear to be terribly important — just two images of iPhone home screens, side by side. But look again, closer this time. These screenshots of what is claimed to be the iPhone 6’s home screen may in fact confirm one of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 phablet’s most important new features.FROM EARLIER: This is the first review of an actual iPhone 6Apple will be hosting a massive press conference on Tuesday, during which two new iPhone 6 models are expected to be unveiled. Until the new phones are official, however, we can expect the flurry of leaks and rumors to continue.Amid the chaos, the Weibo user who seemingly posted the world’s first review of a real, functioning iPhone 6 this past weekend hosted a question and answer session to share more details about Apple’s next-generation flagship iPhone.In the process, he posted the two images above and the one seen below.So, what exactly are we looking at here that is so important?Apple’s new iPhones will reportedly feature larger displays. While the current iPhone models sport 4-inch screens, Apple’s iPhone 6 will supposedly have a 4.7-inch display and the iPhone phablet’s screen will measure 5.5 inches diagonally.In terms of usability, these new screens could be a tough pill to swallow for many current iPhone owners. But at the same time, it’s important to be able to squeeze more content onto these larger displays for users who really want to take advantage of the new real estate.Apple’s solution for both of these issues can likely be seen in the images above.Earlier reports suggested that Apple planned to include a one-handed mode in iOS 8 for use on the new iPhone 6 and iPhone phablet. This special option would allow owners to comfortably use their larger iPhones with one hand, and as we can see above, it looks like there is indeed a toggle that adjusts object sizing on the new iPhones.In this case, we can see that it switches between six rows of large icons and seven rows of smaller icons on the home screen.Also of note, the images above have been resized to 781 x 440 pixels, which is a 16:9 ratio that supports earlier rumors suggesting the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 will have a 1,334 x 750-pixel display.Tune into BGR on Tuesday beginning at 1:00 p.m. EDT, 10:00 a.m. PDT to follow all of the news from Apple’s big event.SEE ALSO: iPhone 6 rumor roundup: Everything you can expect from tomorrow’s big eventMore from BGR: How Apple plans to make iPhone 6 and iWatch must-have devicesThis article was originally published on BGR.com

"It was a major shock to my system and to the whole family."After 24 years of marriage, Seymour and her now ex-husband James Keach split up in April 2013. Seymour, 62, said the two have an amicable relationship now as parents to their twin sons, John and Kristopher."Now, two years later, we are very good friends," Seymour told host Caroline Modarressy-Tehrani. "We spent Thanksgiving together. We'll spend Christmas together. We're a family. We realize the marriage may not be intact, but the family is intact and always will be. We'll always care for one another and care about one another. That doesn't change."Seymour admitted that getting divorced after 24 years of marriage to the same man can be daunting for someone entering their 60s, but she took the time to look inward, and is very much at peace with her situation. She said she has become a much calmer person thanks to her personal calamity."It is frightening," she continued. "I've cried many, many tears. I just didn't do it publicly. But absolutely. And I've questioned a lot of things about myself and I really believe in doing the work on myself. I can't change anybody else. But I can definitely work on making myself a better person."Watch the rest of the clip above, and catch the full HuffPost Live conversation here.Sign up here for Live Today, HuffPost Live's new morning email that will let you know the newsmakers, celebrities and politicians joining us that day and give you the best clips from the day before!
http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-11-13/nancy-pelosi-walks-into-the-grubergate-buzzsaw?cmpid=yhoo	Nancy Pelosi Walks into the #Grubergate Buzzsaw	The first question at House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's post-election news conference went to Fox News's Chad Pergram, who asked what the un-archived comments of "Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber" meant for the coming Obamacare wars."Mr. Gruber's comments were a year old, and he has backtracked from most of them," she said. "You didn't have it in your narrative. That's really important. He is not even advocating the position that he was at some conference and some said. So I don't know who he is. He didn't help write our bill. With all due respect to your question, you have a person who wasn't writing our bill, commenting on what was happening when we were writing our bill, who has withdrawn some of the statements."Pelosi might as well have waved a red flag in front of a target as a starting gun went off. Gruber "wasn't writing" the health care bill? No one said he was, only that he helped walk Democrats through the crafting of the various bills that became the Affordable Care Act. It only made sense; Gruber, an MIT professor, had played a similar role in Massachusetts four years earlier. As speaker of the House, Pelosi herself had promoted Gruber's analyses of the ACA, much as Democrats promoted the work of economist Mark Zandi to prove that their policies had conservative credibility.So the right sprang into action—at Mediaite, on Twitter, and on Twitchy, which aggregated both Pelosi's comments and the spin of reporters who said there was a difference between Gruber being cited by Democrats and Gruber "writing the bill." In very little time, conservatives re-discovered video of Pelosi telling reporters to get right with Gruber's analysis of the ACA.http://youtu.be/pHFOgjXevdkIt was possible, technically, for Democrats to credit Gruber with some of the best ideas inside and outside of Congress during the 2009-2010 debate without saying that Gruber "wrote" the law. But Democrats are explaining, and losing.MORE ON BLOOMBERG POLITICS
http://news.yahoo.com/misspelled-sign-paterson-nj-school-principal-141949588.html	Misspelled sign may have cost principal her job	A principal has been reassigned after a misspelled sign was displayed for more than a week outside a New Jersey school.The message on the sign above the entryway to Paterson’s Public School Number 20 included three mistakes: December was spelled "Dicember," report as "reepor" and a "1" was placed backwards.The errors drew the ire of school Paterson Board of Education member Corey Teague, who saw a photo of the misspelled sign on Facebook.“At first I didn’t believe it," Teague told CBS New York. "I thought it was Photoshopped or something."When Teague found out it was real, he shared the photo on Facebook."How can we expect our children to learn how to spell when the administration can't?" Teague wrote. "We must be held to a higher standard.”“We can’t assume because it’s an urban district — inner-city — that things like this can be swept over," he told the CBS affiliate. "If it were a suburban neighborhood, parents would be outraged."School officials told NJ.com that the lettering "was placed by a custodian and the sign was near an entrance not normally used by staff." It was later corrected.After the gaffe was picked up by several local news outlets, Antoinette Young, the school's principal, was reassigned as a vice principal at a different school.The school district did not disclose the reason for her demotion, but according to NorthJersey.com, Young was already under review for unrelated performance issues.Not everyone agreed with the reassignment.“They don’t talk about all the good things she’s done with the kids," Linda Martinez told CBS New York. "We’re sad to see her go."Young did not return an email seeking comment. She is still listed as principal on the school's website.Her name is listed under the school's motto: "Proper Planning Promotes Success; Failure Is Not An Option!"
http://jalopnik.com/the-secrets-of-the-sultan-of-bruneis-right-hand-drive-f-1656864109	All The Secrets Of The Sultan Of Brunei's Modified Ferrari F40s	All 1,315 Ferrari F40s left the factory as left-hand drive cars with a Rosso Corsa paint job. Or at least that's what Ferrari told the public back in the day. But the Sultan of Brunei got a few with more changes than just the steering wheel.Let me start by telling you that I'm not sure about the exact numbers when it comes to the Sultan's F40s. Most people, including Ferrari experts Talacrest, think that he had seven right-hand drive cars, because Pininfarina only took the conversion gig if he ordered at least six, so he went with seven because he was unbelievably wealthy.Others believe he had 10 RHD F40s altogether (80756 Dark Green, 78426 Yellow, 94759 Red, 85074 Anthracite, 91238 Black, 92235 Red, 87455 White, 89431 Black, 90680 Silver, 91283 Gun Metal Grey), 1 of the black ones being an F40 LM with a black leather interior, red piping, air conditioning and power windows, luxury equipment that completely defeats the whole purpose of an LM.What I do know for sure is that at least two of the Brunei F40s (and an F50) ended up in the UK a few years ago. Meet 91283, the 1992 Gun Metal Grey car with the red pinstripe:It's super badass, I know, but there's much more to it.Ferrari offered buyers a choice of three seats with the F40. Depending on the size of your ass, you could go with slim, medium or wide fit buckets. His Majesty Hassanal Bolkiah is not a large man by any standard, but thought was apparently that the F40's racing seats are too uncomfortable. Not that he was ever going to drive his cars.His solution was simple, yet rather disrespectful nod to the engineering department. He wanted the F40s with the Testarossa's interior. Ferrari looked the other way, and Pininfarina set to work.Two decades later, F40 experts DK Engineering spent about $160K converting the Sultan's Gun Metal car back to original spec keeping the RHD configuration but using LM seats and zero percent real leather. Today, 91283 is a Rosso Corsa car just like Ferrari intended.Talacrest also sold the Sultan's 1988 RHD F40, 78426 with the Giallo Modena paint and 650 horsepower. Some say it was tuned by Michelotto. I guess after those, his RHD 1996 1,200 mile F50 was just the icing on the cake.Want your own Brunei car this instant?

http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2014/06/30/gm-recall-stock-trading-halted/11785801/	GM recalls 7.6M more cars as costs balloon	General Motors announced six new safety recalls Monday — including its single largest this year — involving a total of about 7.55 million vehicles in the U.S.The company also announced that it would increase its second-quarter charges to pay for recalls to $1.2 billion, up from the previous announced $700 million.With the latest recalls, GM now has called back 25.68 million vehicles in the U.S. this year for safety-related repairs — a record for GM and, equal to more than two years of the company's total output. It's also close to the annual average total recalls for all automakers in recent years — though well of the industry's one-year recall record of 58.43 million vehicles in 1999.The cavalcade has come as GM set about cleaning house on pending safety issue after the recalls for a deadly switch defect in February and March. GM is under a federal regulatory microscope because of those recalls, which are linked to 13 deaths."They are expanding (the recalls) now that there is more scrutiny" from safety authorities and Congress, says Sean Kane of Safety Research & Strategies. "Even after the recall barrage, however, there are many, many GM vehicles made over the years that have somehow dodged all the recalls.Most of the vehicles in the latest announcement, more than 6.8 million in the U.S., are covered by a single new recall that extends the small-car ignition switch issue — "unintended ignition key rotation" that can shut off the engine while underway — to more midsize and full-size GM cars.GM spokesman Alan Adler says although the latest recall's ignition switches met GM's specifications, there are fears that if they are bumped or jarred, they can pop into "accessory," disabling the car's airbags.The company says it has identified seven crashes involving eight injuries and three fatalities that could be tied to the latest ignition-switch recall, although it adds there is "no conclusive evidence" of a link.In the small cars, GM has been replacing ignition switches. In the latest batch, the fix will likely be a replacement key with a hole rather than a slot. Adler says owners of the vehicles are urged to drive only with a single key and nothing attached until they get the fix.Models included in Monday's switch recall include the 1997 to 2005 Chevrolet Malibu, 1998 to 2002 Oldsmobile Intrigue, 1999 to 2004 Oldsmobile Alero; 1999 to 2005 Pontiac Grand Am; 2000 to 2005 Pontiac Grand Am; 2000 to 2005 Chevrolet Impala and Monte Carlo and 2004 to 2008 Pontiac Grand Prix. A separate U.S. recall covers 554,328 vehicles: the 2003 to 2014 Cadillac CTS and 2004 to 2006 Cadillac SRX.Trading in GM stock was halted at 2:30 p.m. ET and resumed by 3 p.m., once the GM recall news and new charges were announced. The stock closed at $36.30, down 32 cents, or 0.87%, on the day.Also on Monday, details of a compensation fund for victims of the small-car switch recalls were disclosed by fund administrator Kenneth Feinberg. He said GM has agreed to pay, without individual case or total fund limit, anyone Feinberg believes is entitled to compensation for death or injury. Feinberg noted that claims can be filed not only by people riding in any seat in the GM cars with the bad switches, but by pedestrians and people in other cars involved in wrecks with those GM cars.Besides switch-related recalls, GM also announced recalls of:Contributing: Paul OverbergRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1lsQ5KE

http://time.com/money/3592414/social-security-rule-change-benefit-withdrawals/?xid=yahoo_money	Why Social Security Suddenly Changed Its Benefits Withdrawal Rule	Robert A. Di Ieso, Jr.Q: I retired in 2009 to care for an ailing parent who has since passed away. I took Social Security at age 62, when the law allowed claimants to pay back their Social Security and receive the highest benefits at age 70. Since that time the law has changed and repayment can only be made in the first year. Do you know of any proposal to change the current rules for those who signed up under the old law? —SandraA: As Sandra correctly notes, Social Security changed its benefits withdrawal policy in December 2010, after she had retired under its prior rules—and it’s one of the most unusual policy shifts that the agency has enacted. Consider that Social Security, which often gets dinged for slow response time, made this change lightning fast. What’s more, the new policy seems to have little to do with the needs of beneficiaries like Sandra and everything to do with the agency being surprised—and perhaps chagrined—that people were paying attention to its often arcane rules and actually taking advantage of them.Under the old policy, people who had begun receiving benefits could, at any time, pay back everything they’d received and effectively wipe clean their benefit history. By resetting their benefit record this way, people who took reduced retirement benefits early would be able to file later for much higher monthly payments. For people born between 1943 and 1954, for example, retirement benefits at age 70 are 76% higher than those taken at age 62.Few people paid much attention to this rule until a growing group of financial planners and Social Security experts began highlighting the possible gains of withdrawing benefits and delaying claiming. As the word spread, journalists began to write about these rules for an even wider audience.Social Security, which previously had no problem with the rule when few were using it, changed its mind as more and more people began withdrawing their benefits. Suddenly, without an extended period for evaluation or debate, the agency issued a final rule limiting the benefit withdrawal option—and it took effect immediately. If the public wanted to comment, it would be able to do so only after the rule was changed. By comparison, the decision to raise the official retirement age in the program from 66 to 67 was enacted in 1983—37 years before it will take effect in the year 2020.Here’s what the agency said at the time it changed its rules on withdrawing benefits:“The agency is changing its withdrawal policy because recent media articles have promoted the use of the current policy as a means for retired beneficiaries to acquire an ‘interest-free loan.’ However, this ‘free loan’ costs the Social Security Trust Fund the use of money during the period the beneficiary is receiving benefits with the intent of later withdrawing the application and the interest earned on these funds. The processing of these withdrawal applications is also a poor use of the agency’s limited administrative resources in a time of fiscal austerity—resources that could be better used to serve the millions of Americans who need Social Security’s services.”Further, in making the shift to a one-year withdrawal period, the agency explained that the policy was designed to reduce the value of the option so few people would use it. Today, by the way, the agency supports delaying retirement much more than it used to.Of course, telling people to delay claiming is of little help to people like Sandra, who retired under the old rule and was caught by the sudden policy shift. Is there any likelihood that the rule could be changed to accommodate this group? Not really, says James Nesbitt, a Social Security claims representative for nearly 40 years who is now providing benefits expertise for High Falls Advisors in Rochester, NY. “Unfortunately,” he says, “this change did not contain any grandfathering provision. I am not aware of any pending actions within Congress or Social Security that would extend grandfather rights to those who were disadvantaged by this change.”Philip Moeller is an expert on retirement, aging, and health. His book, “Get What’s Yours: The Secrets to Maxing Out Your Social Security,” will be published in February by Simon & Schuster.

http://www.newsweek.com/caramel-apples-and-ice-cream-leave-dozens-life-threatening-listeria-infections-295031	Caramel Apples and Ice Cream Leave Dozens With Life Threatening Listeria Infections	The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention along with the Food and Drug Administration are cautioning Americans to stay away from certain caramel apples. Commercially-produced and pre-packaged apples—the kind typically sold at grocery stores—have been linked to listeria monocytogenes infections, also called listeriosis.According to the FDA, “Listeria monocytogenes is an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems.” When the organism infects pregnant women, it can also lead to miscarriages and stillborn births. The bacteria can be spread by ingesting affected food, making contact with infected animals and is also passed from mother to child during pregnancy.As of December 22, the CDC has found 29 infected people across ten states, all of whom have been hospitalized. Of those 29, three have died due to causes linked directly to listeriosis; the CDC believes infection may have contributed to the death of the fourth.  Try Newsweek for only $1.25 per weekIt remains unclear which brands have been affected and the CDC is still working to determine the contamination source. It is also not yet clear whether it is the caramel coating or the apples that are causing the outbreak, but, according to the CDC, "at this time, no illnesses related to this outbreak have been linked to apples that are not caramel-coated and not prepackaged or to caramel candy.”Some caramel apple manufacturers, such as Missouri-based Happy Apple Company, are issuing voluntary recalls as the CDC continues their investigation. “We recently received notice from Bidart Brothers, one of our apple suppliers to our California facility that there may be a connection between this outbreak and the apples that they supplied to that facility,” the company said in a statement.Simultaneously, two other cases of the infection, both in Washington state, were linked to frozen desserts produced by Snoqualmie Gourmet Ice Cream. Both patients are currently recovering from the disease and remain hospitalized. Meanwhile, the company issued a voluntary recall on ice cream, gelato, custard and sorbet of all flavors. The products were distributed in fourteen states. It is unclear whether the ice cream-related infections are in any way connected to the caramel apple-related infections.

Butler turned down the love-it-or-leave-it last attempt by the franchise.Derrick Rose, who injured his left ankle in the second quarter after a stellar start to his night, eventually was pulled in the third when he felt like the injury limited him.“Right now, I’m feeling good,’’ Rose said after the loss dropped the Bulls to 1-1. “My ankle is throbbing a little bit, but just playing basketball.“Go to Minnesota, try and give it a go [Saturday]. If not, still have [79 games]. I guess it’s part of the process. I guess the gods are testing me. It’s fine. I’ll get through it.’’Rose said X-rays were negative.“I just sprained my ankle and had to sit out,’’ Rose said. “I’m walking around, so everyone can breathe.“I hurt it in the first half, tried to give it a go in the second half, but it kind of limited me a little bit, ­shooting jump shots and wasn’t getting the bounce I wanted.’’The unfortunate part was Rose had 18 points in the first half, and did so on 7-for-12 shooting.As for Butler, he has yet to play, being sidelined with a sprained left thumb ligament.“Is that a serious question? I think everybody knows,’’ Butler said, when asked if he wanted to stay with the organization. “All y’all, the whole city. This is home for me, besides Tomball [Texas], of course. Everyone knows that. This is the city I want to be in.’’By not reaching a deal, Butler can become a restricted free agent in July.“I’m not a personal guy, I don’t take everything to heart,’’ Butler said, when asked if he took the last-ditch offer by the Bulls as a personal insult. “I understand this is a business and this is basketball, so I just have to be a better … a great basketball player.’’The Bulls had more immediate concerns coming out of the game. They were outrebounded by the Cavs 52-42 and allowed 20 offensive rebounds.“It was the difference in the game I thought, second shot,’’ coach Tom Thibodeau said.Taj Gibson sprained his left ankle, left the game and disappeared into the locker room until he came out in the fourth and played hero with a slam at the four-minute mark to put the Bulls up 90-89.Kirk Hinrich scored 10 in the fourth for the Bulls, including eight in the span of a minute late in the quarter.The Cavs tied the game with 27.9 seconds left after Kyrie Irving was fouled on a layup, sending the game to overtime.That’s when the absence of Butler (sprained left thumb ligaments) was truly felt. James scored the first eight points of the overtime for the Cavs.Email: [email protected]Twitter: @suntimes_hoopsSource: http://www.suntimes.com/
http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/10/why-nigeria-stopped-ebola-but-not-boko-haram/381442/	Why Nigeria Was Able to Beat Ebola, but Not Boko Haram	Olamikan Gbemiga/APFor Nigeria’s embattled government, October 20 is a date worth circling on the calendar: That day will mark 42 days since Nigeria’s last confirmed Ebola case, which, at twice the 21-day incubation period, will allow the country to declare itself free of a disease that has ravaged its West African neighbors.Tuesday, Nigeria reached a milestone it would much rather ignore: Six months ago, militants from the terrorist group Boko Haram kidnapped 276 schoolgirls from the country’s Chibok region, and, despite a worldwide campaign to free them, 219 remain in captivity. While the kidnapping has attracted significant publicity—epitomized by the viral #BringBackOurGirls campaign on Twitter—violence attributed to Boko Haram has killed thousands in Nigeria’s northern provinces.The contrast between the two anniversaries raises an uncomfortable question: Faced with these two enormous crises, how has Nigeria handled one so well and the other so poorly?One major reason is Nigeria’s political geography, which, throughout the country’s post-colonial history, has caused great turmoil. A country of some 170 million people split into numerous ethnic and linguistic groups, Nigeria has struggled to bridge the gap between its relatively affluent Christian south and its poorer Muslim north.Boko Haram, whose name roughly means “Western education is a sin,” has exploited this divide. The group largely operates in Nigeria’s three northeastern provinces, all of which are controlled by the opposition All People’s Congress (APC) party and where distrust of President Goodluck Jonathan’s government runs high.“A lot of people in northern Nigeria are, in fact, disgusted with Boko Haram,” Rudy Atallah, a senior fellow at The Atlantic Council and an expert on Nigeria, said. “But because the population of the North has felt neglected by the South for so long, many of them view Boko Haram as an able body fighting against the government.”By contrast, when Patrick Sawyer, the Liberian-American man who tested positive for Ebola, arrived in Lagos, he found himself in a city equipped with West Africa’s most advanced health-care infrastructure as well as the headquarters of many multinational organizations. And, unlike the fight against Boko Haram, combating Ebola transcends ethnic, political, and religious divisions.“Ebola impacts everyone,” Atallah noted. “It doesn’t have ties to particular sects or groups.”The next inflection point in Nigerian politics may come in February, when the country chooses a new president. Having served one full term, Jonathan will be eligible.* A victory by his People’s Democratic Party, which has governed Nigeria for 14 years and whose voter base resides in the south, may exacerbate the already fierce regional divide in the country, as well as make the search for the remaining 219 hostages even more difficult.* This post originally stated that Goodluck Jonathan was ineligible for reelection. We regret the error.
https://www.yahoo.com/travel/what-really-causes-plane-crashes-its-not-what-125605316542.html	What Really Causes Plane Crashes? (It’s Not What You Think)	A study by Boeing blamed mechanical failure for roughly 20 percent of today’s commercial air accidents (other studies have reached that same conclusion). But as aviation safety analyst, pilot and FAA Safety Team representative Kyle Bailey tells Yahoo Travel: “Mechanical failure isn’t as prominent as most people think.” While it seem like a high percentage, in the early days of flying it was the culprit in the vast majority of accidents, as many as 80 percent.Bailey says we can thank improved airplane technology for the improvement. “The backup systems, the redundancy, and the computers pretty much are triple checking what pilots are doing,” he says. Plus, planes are being built better. “These airplanes aren’t like buying a $30,000 car; we’re talking about a $400 million 747,” Bailey says. “Each component that’s in there, every single component, is manufactured by an engineer to precise standards.”In all, improved airplane technology is the factor most often attributed to the massive decline in accidents and marked improvement in commercial air safety in recent years. “The airplanes that are designed and built are so safe, even as a pilot it’s hard for me to comprehend how safe an airplane actually is,” Bailey says. Weather Bad weather can be a significant problem for airliners. (Photo: iStock)The National Transportation Safety Board finds weather is a primary contributing factor in 23 percent of all aviation accidents. “Whether it’s a small plane or a big plane,” Bailey says, “getting yourself into weather that’s a little bit above the scope of what an airplane can handle" often leads to trouble. He points to last December’s crash of AirAsia flight QZ8501, which went down during a flight from Indonesia to Singapore, killing all 162 people aboard. Thunderstorms with cloud tops above 50,000 feet were reported in the area before the crash and are considered a possible factor. Related: AirAsia Crash Begs Question: Can Severe Weather Bring Down a Plane?“Those storms are going on every single day, all around that area, and [pilots] learn to weave their way through them,” Bailey says. “Ninety-nine percent of the time, they do a fine job. But there’s always that fraction of a percent that something will happen, something will go wrong, or you might misinterpret something and you’ll find yourself a little bit too close to or inside the thunderstorm.”  Investigators in Indonesia recover the flight data recorder from the crash of AirAsia flight QZ8501, which many suspect was weather-related. (Photo: AP)Thunderstorms, says Bailey, are especially treacherous. “[Planes] can withstand lightning,” he says. “But they can’t withstand going directly through a thunderstorm.” He adds hail, winds, updrafts, and downdrafts can wreak havoc with a plane, sometimes with disastrous results.WATCH: In-Flight Shock: What It Looks Like When A Plane’s Struck By Lightning Human ErrorThis plane crash in Taiwan may have been preceded by a critical mistake in the cockpit. (Photo: AP)The numbers may vary, but the experts agree: Human error is the biggest cause of plane accidents. The focus is often on the pilots. PlaneCrashInfo.com analyzed 1,015 fatal accidents involving commercial aircraft, worldwide, from 1950 thru 2010, and found pilot error was a factor in 53 percent of all fatal accidents in that period. “The planes are so complicated and sophisticated and have so many backup systems, [accidents] usually [are caused by] pilot error,” Bailey says. “If somebody comes up to me and says, ‘Planes are unsafe, blah blah blah,’ I’ll always say, ‘You shouldn’t be afraid of the plane, you should be afraid of the human element.’” And when you add all human factors — mistakes by mechanics and air traffic controllers in addition to pilots — Boeing estimates human error in general might be a factor in as many as 80 percent of all airplane accidents. Human error can also work in tragic concert with other leading causes of crashes — for instance, a pilot making a bad weather-related decision or making a catastrophic mistake while dealing with a mechanical issue. The latter may have been the case with TransAsia Airways Flight GE235, which crashed in Taiwan back in February (a widely seen video showed the plane clipping a bridge before crashing into a river), killing 43 of the 58 people aboard:WATCH: Crash of TransAsia Airways Flight GE235The plane’s troubles started when one of its two engines malfunctioned. But a critical mistake in the cockpit is what authorities believed caused the crash. “That was the pilot shutting down the wrong engine inadvertently,” says Bailey, echoing concerns that the TransAsia pilot shut off the working engine instead of the malfunctioning engine, causing the plane to stall.Unfortunately, one can’t completely account for the human factor in plane incidents. After all, Bailey says, pilots are only people and not immune to the family stress, job pressure, fatigue, or inattention that can lead to disaster. “Things like that start to take their toll on the pilot and on everything running smoothly,” says Bailey. IntentionalThe intentional crash of Germanwings Flight 4U9525 was a stark reminder that flights can be vulnerable to human misdeeds. (Photo: AP)An especially rare cause of plane disasters (accounting for 8 percent of all fatal plane accidents since 1950s, according to PlaneCrashInfo.com) is also one of the most frightening: intentional sabotage. The 9/11 attacks fit into this category, as does the more recent case of Germanwings Flight 4U9525, which a co-pilot purposefully crashed into a mountain back in March, killing all 150 people aboard. Bailey finds that case especially troubling. “Most pilots are highly dedicated people,” he says, “But obviously every pilot is a human being and you know, human beings have problems.” But the good newsStill the safest, and coolest, way to travel  (Photo: iStock)You simply can’t look at scary aviation stats without acknowledging their most crystal-clear conclusion: that flying is incredibly safe and getting safer, despite high-profile accidents like Flight MH370. The International Air Transport Association says last year’s global jet accident rate was the lowest in history; the equivalent of one accident for every 4.4 million flights. The overall number of commercial airline fatalities also is near historic lows, despite the fact that the number of flights has increased dramatically in recent decades. That should be the gigantic grain of salt with which you take any scary stats about flying. Let Yahoo Travel inspire you every day.

http://thehill.com/opinion/katie-pavlich/228190-katie-pavlich-the-audacity-of-al-sharpton	Katie Pavlich: The audacity of Al Sharpton	By Katie Pavlich - 12/29/14 01:10 PM ESTWhen Barack Obama was elected to be the 44th president of the United States, there were high hopes for what he could accomplish. A nation that had made its way past slavery, through a Civil War and beyond segregation was finally going to fully heal as Americans elected their first black president. Sadly, that promise and those dreams never came true. In fact, the opposite has happened. America’s race scars have been cut wide open, and the healing has been replaced with unnecessary and deceitful division. How? Obama’s decision to build a partnership with and lend credibility to one particular person is partially to blame.  MSNBC host, tax evader and proclaimed “Reverend” Al Sharpton is a top adviser to President Obama and has been since day one in the Oval Office. In fact, with more than 60 visits to the White House during Obama’s tenure, you could say Sharpton is one of the top advisers outside of paid staff. Heck, he’s even vacationed with the president on Martha’s Vineyard and has a close relationship with senior White House adviser Valerie Jarrett. He’s also played a key role in advising Obama about nominations to powerful positions inside the federal government, including a replacement for Attorney General Eric Holder as the nation’s top law enforcement officer.It was just recently that President Obama spoke at Sharpton’s April 2014 National Action Network conference, where he praised and glorified him as a leader.“I want to say, first of all, thank you to your leader, Reverend Al Sharpton. Give him a big round of applause,” Obama said, giving him even more legitimacy. Attorney General Eric Holder said similar things during a speech at the conference, going out of his way to repeatedly thank him for his friendship and longtime partnership.Considering Al Sharpton has taught his followers and young men in the black community to judge and hate those born with a different skin color, it’s alarming how much access he’s had to the most powerful offices in the country. Sharpton is a liar, conman and professional manipulator. Throughout his years on the public stage, which have been many, the majority on the left have embraced his ideas and upheld him as a go-to source on problems plaguing the black community. Sharpton has been performing this act for years, and he’s finally made it to the A-list on the White House visitor’s log.When “peaceful” protesters took to the streets of New York City for Al Sharpton’s Million Marchers earlier this month, many of them chanted, “What do we want? Dead cops! When do want them? Now!”Did Sharpton rightly condemn them? No. Instead, he offered soft rhetoric and tried to distance himself from his own supporters in order to evade responsibility for their actions. When NYPD officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu were executed, Sharpton had the audacity to turn himself into the victim and tried to gain sympathy from the press by playing an alleged death threat voicemail.“Hey [n-word], stop killing innocent people. I’m going to get you!” the voicemail Sharpton played said. Is it legitimate? With Sharpton’s track record, who knows."I've had several like this. ... We are now under intense threat from those that are misguided, by those that are trying to blame everyone from civil rights leaders to the mayor rather than deal with an ugly spirit that all of us need to fight,” Sharpton lamented. “The blame game will only lead to further kinds of venom and further division.”How rich. The man who has made a living and a career spewing racial venom and inciting a false blame game for decades now wants everyone else to avoid … the blame game.This isn’t the first time Sharpton has been on the side of the wrong “victim.” Cowards like Sharpton stoke bogus racial flames with gasoline and then run away crying politics or “blame” when real consequences happen, whether it’s the lives of young men being ruined by people like Tawana Brawley, or the families of NYPD officers Ramos and Liu who will never see them again.If Al Sharpton and his ilk really worked to solve problems and true racial disparities in America, they’d work their way out of a job, out of money and, most importantly, out of power, which is why Sharpton has been championing the same causes for decades with little results to show for it.Will President Obama ever condemn Sharpton? Will Holder? No, and it’s because they truly agree with his ideas and believe in his positions, regardless of whether those ideas and positions are based in fact or help the country move forward.Like the brave police officers of the New York City Police Department have turned their backs on Mayor Bill de Blasio, it’s about time the same be done to Sharpton.Pavlich is the news editor for Townhall.com and a Fox News contributor.
http://www.examiner.com/article/obama-disarms-border-patrol-agents	Obama disarms border patrol agents	It is quite apparent that Obama is disarming border patrol agents in advance of his forthcoming executive order that will provide amnesty to illegal immigrants. Approximately half of the United States Customs and Border Patrol's M4 carbine weapons have been taken away by the federal government, supposedly because the weapons posed safety concerns for border agents. Some people do not buy this explanation, such as Representative Steve King (R-Iowa.)Congressman King said with a laugh: “There’s no more reliable weapon in the world,” and that “Any agency like the Department of Homeland Security that has bought millions of rounds of ammunition over the past few years could certainly afford to replace with new serviceable M4s all the weapons they are [taking] for testing. This sounds to me like a ruse to start to take the weapons out of the hands of the Border Patrol.” King stated that "the M4, M16 and AR15 have interchangeable parts and feature identical action," and “If there were any problem with them as far as safety was concerned, it would be all over the Internet.”King emphasized that the Department of Homeland Security must beheld accountable for what he referred to as an entirely specious argument. He said: “I don’t get it. How does DHS go from ‘Fast and Furious’ to disarming the Border Patrol?” King was obviously referring to the Justice Department's gun scandal, during which thousands of weapons were sent to Mexico and ultimately ended up in criminals' hands.“If you disarm the Border Patrol in preparation for issuing an executive edict of unconstitutional amnesty, that starts a flood of illegal immigrants into the United States, and we can’t protect our borders,” King stated.Art del Cueto, the Border Patrol’s Tucson Sector union president said that in over a decade of time spent on Border Patrol duties, he has never seen so many weapons removed by the federal government at one time due to "safety" issues. He also stated that the federal agents arrived to inspect and confiscate the weapons with no advance notice, but rather simply showed up and told agents that a certain number of weapons had "issues" and must be removed.“We have trained armorers working as agents and if there were problems with any of the weapons, they could have been fixed without federal agents removing them,” he said. “We are hearing that some of the problems were firing pins. We could have removed firing pins without requiring federal agents to remove the weapon and send it off somewhere for repairs.”As a result of this weapon confiscation by the federal government, border agents in the area do not have personally sighted weapons anymore. Rather, all border patrol agents are currently using M4s that were used previously by someone else. Congressman King expressed a determination to find out exactly what the Department of Homeland Security is up to at the border.

Photo courtesy Candice Curry.The relationship between a mother and a stepmother is probably one of the trickiest to navigate. In theory, you’d get along for the good of the child you have in common. In practice, it’s not always so simple. There’s often history and baggage between exes, bitterness and jealousy between biological mom and stepmom, resentment from just about everyone.STORY: An Open Letter To My Daughter’s Step-DadBut that’s not the case with 39-year-old mother Candice Curry and her daughter’s stepmother, 29-year-old Ashley Parish. In fact, both women are very clear on one point: They love each other.In a Nov. 30 post on her blog that quickly went viral, receiving more than 10,000 Facebook shares and getting syndicated on sites like Thought Catalog, Today and Huffington Post, the San Antonio mom wrote “An Open Letter to My Daughter’s Stepmom.”“I never wanted you here. You simply were never part of the plan. Growing up and dreaming of my family I never included you. I didn’t want help from another woman to raise my child. The plan was for my family to include me, daddy and our children, not you,” Curry writes. “When I first met you I’ll admit you weren’t what I had in mind and a twinge of jealousy shot through my body. You were supposed to be hideous, remember? But you weren’t, you were stunningly beautiful. You were supposed to be a mean old hag, remember? But you weren’t, you were a young, sweet woman. … You’ve accepted our daughter from the very start and have unconditionally loved both her and her daddy, that’s a true gift to all of us. You’ve included our daughter in everything you do and make her feel loved and accepted. You put her relationship with her daddy above yours and only a brave and courageous woman knows how to do that with such grace.”STORY: Surviving the Holidays as a Single MomCurry goes on to thank Parish for respecting her position as 14-year-old Stiles’ mother, for filling in as ‘mom’ when Curry is away, and for unconditionally loving Stiles. “Ashley is so gracious and respectful of our daughter,” Candice tells Yahoo Parenting. “She always includes her, and was immediately so accepting, and that’s very hard to do for a woman who goes into a relationship with a man that has a kid. That’s a tough spot to be in.”Curry, Stiles, and Curry’s ex-husband. Photo courtesy Candice Curry.After one of Stiles’ recent volleyball games, Curry says Stiles got in the car and announced that her friends thought it strange that Curry and Parish were sitting together. “It would be so sad if Stiles had to go from one side of the gym to the other just to say hi to all of her parents,” Curry says. “But she doesn’t know that our relationship isn’t the norm.”Curry, who has four other children—8-year-old triplets and a 9-month-old son—with her current husband, says she wrote the letter “so that other families could see that it can be this way, and so that Ashley can know that I love her.”STORY: Parents of Triplets Now Expecting TwinsAnd it worked. Parish says reading the post made her cry. “It was the sweetest thing anyone has ever said to me in a really long time,” she tells Yahoo Parenting. “For her to recognize my role — not that I’m looking for recognition — felt so good.”Parish says she grew up with divorced parents, so she was cognizant of her place in the family as soon as she started dating her now-husband. “My father had a lot of girlfriends growing up, and I remember them very often taking the attention away from my sister and me, so my first thought was ‘I’m not going to be that way,’” Parish tells Yahoo Parenting. “The relationship between a girl and her father is so important, so when we have the girls at our house, I want them to feel like the center of attention.”Though Parish and Curry haven’t actually seen each other since the post was written, Parish says she can’t wait. “I need to hug her and thank her in person.”Family therapist Dr. Paul Hokemeyer says getting to this place of respect between co-parents is incredibly difficult. “Parents have evolved to protect their offspring, so the initial response of biological parents is going to be to reject a new person who comes into their child’s life and think they aren’t good enough and keep them at arm’s length,” he tells Yahoo Parenting. “It takes someone who is really evolved to accept someone new into the family.”So what have Parish and Curry figured out that so many parents struggle with? Primarily, that children need to be the first priority, says Robert Emery, Director of the Center for Children, Families and the Law and author of “The Truth about Children and Divorce.” “Kids in families who live apart want a life where everyone is on a team — their team,” Emery tells Yahoo Parenting. “Congratulations to both of these women for putting the life of a child ahead of their own issues. And congratulations to them for dealing with understandable issues like fear, jealousy, and uncertainty, and coming out stronger and deeper on the other side.”Curry says the trick to her happy family is acceptance. “We had to put the past in the past and move forward and be cohesive with each other,” she says of her ex-husband and Parish. “At some point you have to accept where life has brought you and move forward and do what is best for your child. And we never ever badmouth the other parent or step-parents. Even in our worst moments, my daughter has never heard one single bad statement about them. That would be tearing away at half of who she is.”To all the other moms dealing with stepmoms, Curry’s advice is simple: “You’re always going to be the mom, but try and find a way to be grateful for the person who is with your child in your absence.”

http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/12/5/7339327/jon-stewart-sean-hannity	Watch Jon Stewart's face when "martial arts student" Sean Hannity discussed Eric Garner	On Wednesday, Jon Stewart couldn't find much to be funny about in Eric Garner's death. "If comedy is tragedy plus time," he said, "I need more fucking time."By Thursday, however, he'd found some dark humor in the case — namely, in the rationalizations being made for why police had to choke Garner to death for selling cigarettes. The narrative, if parsed closely,  quickly collapses in on itself. As Stewart puts it, it ends up painting Garner as a "a dangerously large, but incredibly fragile, out-of-shape, monster weakling."In other words, the legend of "the giant negro" is alive here, too, but merged with a secondary rationalization that if Garner simply wasn't so fat — if he had taken more responsibility for his own life — he would still be alive today.Of course, he would also still be alive today if police hadn't put him in a chokehold.Speaking of that chokehold, you're not going to want to miss Fox News' Sean Hannity beginning his analysis of the move with "as a martial arts student"...The Daily Show Get More: Daily Show Full Episodes,The Daily Show on Facebook,Daily Show Video Archive
http://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2014/12/13/new-windows-7-patch-is-effectively-malware-disables-graphics-driver-updates-and-windows-defender/	New Windows 7 Patch Is Badware, Disables Graphics Driver Updates And Windows Defender	*Due to some valid complaints regarding my usage of the term “Malware,” I’ve updated the headline with a more accurate description of the Windows Update: “Badware,” which is unintentionally harmful software. If you have Windows 7 set to automatically update every Tuesday, it may be time to permanently disable that feature. Microsoft Microsoft has just confirmed that a recent update — specifically KB 3004394 — is causing a range of serious problems and recommends removing it.The first issue that caught my attention, via AMD’s Robert Hallock, is that KB 3004394 blocks the installation or update of graphics drivers such as AMD’s new Catalyst Omega. Nvidia users are also reporting difficulty installing GeForce drivers, though I can’t confirm this personally as my machines are all Windows 8.1. Hallock recommended manually uninstalling the update, advice now echoed officially by Microsoft.Unfortunately this newest update isn’t limited to graphics driver problems. Redmond hasn’t directly divulged each and every issue, but Microsoft’s Answer Forum is littered with tech-savvy users reporting that USB 3.0 drivers are broken and User Account Control (UAC) prompts have gone haywire. Microsoft has acknowledged that it even prevents the installation of future Windows Updates.Perhaps most troubling is that the Windows Defender service – crucial software that blocks viruses and malware — has been disabled by the update.Note that these problems are isolated to Windows 7 users.Removing KB3004394Microsoft has issued a patch to patch the patch (sorry, couldn’t resist that one), which is KB3024777 and is available directly through Windows Update. My advice? Just manually remove the problem by browsing to Control Panel -> Windows Update -> View Update History -> Installed Updates. Then, highlight the update named KB3004394 and click the “Uninstall” button. This is confirmed to resolve the issues, and Microsoft has removed the original update from the pipeline.If you are on automatic updates, it’s possible KB3024777 has already installed itself and made things right. Still, a lot of Windows 7 customers from casual to gamers to power users will have been affected by this, and I’ve heard numerous firsthand reports from readers who’ve been pulling their hair out over this. Some even forked over cash to their local computer shops to troubleshoot what they couldn’t identify and fix themselves.The moral of the story is this: Return to your main Windows Update area and change your settings from “Install updates automatically” to “Check for updates but let me choose whether to download and install them.”See, Microsoft has a bit of a spotty track record with Windows Updates, and this isn’t the first one to cripple systems. My recommendation is to install system updates about two weeks after they’ve been released, allowing enough time for any potential problems to be identified by users, reported on by the press, and fixed by Microsoft.Linux fans, I’m beginning to see your side of the story.UPDATE: Several readers have pointed out that disabling automatic Windows Updates is bad advice, and while that’s a fair argument I have to disagree. There have been no less than 3 occurrences in the last 3 years where Microsoft has issued software and firmware updates to their Xbox platform which have “bricked” — or rendered useless — the consoles. And Windows updates that have bricked PCs? There’s this example from August 2014. Or this example from April 2013 which caused widespread BSODs (Blue Screens of Death.) Or this example which made Surface 2 Windows tablets unusable. And here’s a more comprehensive list of issues that Windows Update caused from just last year.Microsoft's Biggest Hits And FlopsStay updated on my Forbes content by subscribing to my RSS feed. Continue the conversation by following me on Twitter and joining me on Facebook. 
http://www.ibtimes.com/jessa-duggars-wedding-dress-photo-released-details-about-19-kids-counting-stars-special-1717462	Jessa Duggar’s Wedding Dress Photo Released; Details About The ‘19 Kids And Counting’ Star’s Special Day With Ben Seewald	The Duggar family of TLC’s “19 Kids and Counting” celebrated another wedding over the weekend. Jessa Duggar, the fifth-oldest child of Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar, wed Ben Seewald Saturday.Jessa, 21, and Ben, 19, began dating a year ago and had their engagement shown during an August episode of “19 Kids and Counting.” Just a few months later, the pair tied the knot. While fans of the family weren’t invited to the private ceremony, cameras were. Like Jessa Duggar’s older sister, Jill, her wedding to Ben will be shown on TLC’s hit series. But viewers will have to wait a little while to watch the reality-television star walk down the aisle. The wedding special will reportedly be shown during the series’ 10th season next year.Fortunately, details on their nuptials -- from her gorgeous dress to their first kiss -- have been released online.The CeremonyThe wedding took place at the First Baptist Church of Bentonville, Ark., Saturday. With more than 1,000 guests in attendance, Jessa said “I do” to Ben with her maid of honor and younger sister, Jinger Duggar, at her side. The groom stood at the altar with his best man and friend Dylan McMahan.The Wedding DressJessa Duggar dished to People magazine in early September that she had picked out her dress only recently for her November wedding. “I went with the second dress I tried on,” she told People. “I love it.”Although she didn’t give any details about her wedding dress then, People released the first photographs of the 21-year-old bride in her gown Saturday. The dress was from the Allure Bridals “Modest” collection. Made from English net and satin, the so-called regal gown featured a ballgown skirt and “intricate beading throughout the bodice.” While the piece came in white/silver and ivory/silver, the bride chose to go the less traditional route with a “champagne/ silver” color instead.“We didn’t know if she would like it because it wasn’t the traditional white,” said Lindsay Stavely, co-owner at Tesori Bridal in Fayetteville, Ark. “She kept coming back to this dress and all her sisters were like, ‘The second one, the second one,’ so everyone agreed.”But Jessa Duggar did put her own spin on it. The bride reportedly removed the sash from the waist of the dress, along with some of the tulle.The First KissJust like Jill Duggar, Jessa was waiting until marriage to share her first kiss with Ben. However, the bride wanted to keep the moment just between her and her husband. A source told Us Weekly that Jessa and Ben chose not to share a kiss during the ceremony because they reportedly “wanted to experience that special moment in private.”The couple’s pastor, the Rev. Mike Schadt, confirmed the bride and groom’s decision to People. “They wanted their very first kiss ever to be in private,” he said. “It was important to both of them.”But those in attendance still got to witness a “Duggar Kiss”: Schadt asked the bride’s parents, Jim Bob and Michelle, to share one for the crowd.TLC’s “19 Kids and Counting” is shown Tuesdays at 9 p.m. EST. Jessa Duggar’s and Ben Seewald’s wedding will be featured on the show during Season 10 in 2015.

http://news.discovery.com/space/astronomy/extreme-storms-erupt-on-uranus-baffling-astronomers-141114.htm	Extreme Storms Erupt on Uranus, Baffling Astronomers	Uranus is finally having some summer storms, seven years after the planet reached its closest approach to the sun, leaving scientists wondering why the massive storms are so late.Play Video What We Can Learn from the Newly Found 'Exo-Uranus'The usually quiet gas giant now has such "incredibly active" weather that some of the features are even visible to amateurs, said Imke de Pater, the project's lead researcher and an astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley. Astronomers first announced the extreme storms on Uranus in August, and have been trying to understand them ever since.ANALYSIS: There's a Mysterious Spot on Uranus!This is by far the most active weather de Pater's team has seen on Uranus in the past decade, examining its storms and northern convective features. It also paints a different picture of the quiet planet Voyager 2 saw when the NASA spacecraft flew by in 1986. [Photos of Uranus, the Tilted Planet]"This type of activity would have been expected in 2007, when Uranus' once-every-42-year equinox occurred and the sun shined directly on the equator," research co-investigator Heidi Hammel, of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, said in a statement. "But we predicted that such activity would have died down by now. Why we see these incredible storms now is beyond anybody's guess."But here's where the mystery comes in: As far as anyone can tell, Uranus has no source of internal heat. Sunlight is thought to be responsible for changes in its atmosphere, such as storms. But the sun's light is currently weak in Uranus' northern hemisphere, so scientists are puzzled as to why that area is so active today.NEWS: Supersized Storms Spotted Erupting on UranusDe Pater's team tracked eight large storms in Uranus' northern hemisphere when observing the planet with the Keck II telescope between Aug. 5 and 6. One storm stood out from the rest: Shining in 2.2 microns, a wavelength sensitive to clouds in the tropopause (just below the stratosphere), it made up 30 percent of all of the light reflected from Uranus.Another storm, visible at 1.6 microns, could even be seen by amateur astronomers. One observer, Marc Delcroix from France, photographed it with his 1-meter telescope."I was thrilled to see such activity on Uranus," Delcroix said in a Keck Observatory statement. "Getting details on Mars, Jupiter or Saturn is now routine. But seeing details on Uranus and Neptune are the new frontiers for us amateurs, and I did not want to miss that."Based on the colors and structure of the storm spotted by amateurs, professional astronomers believe it could hint at a vortex deeper in the atmosphere — similar to phenomena spotted on Jupiter, such as the Great Red Spot.ANALYSIS: Diamond Oceans Possible on Uranus, NeptuneFollow-up observations with the Keck II telescope revealed that the storm was still raging, although it had changed its shape, and possibly its intensity.Also contributing to the effort was the Hubble Space Telescope, which examined the entire planet of Uranus Oct. 14 in several wavelengths. The observations revealed storms spanning several altitudes, over a distance of about 5,592 miles (9,000 kilometers)."If, indeed, these features are high-altitude clouds generated by flow perturbations associated with a deeper vortex system, such drastic fluctuations in intensity would indeed be possible," said Larry Sromovsky, a planetary scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who performed the newer work.More from SPACE.com:Photos: Most Powerful Storms of the Solar System Uranus And Neptune: The Mysterious Outer Giants | Video Uranus, Seventh Planet in Earth’s Solar System Was First Discovered PlanetOriginal article on Space.com.

http://news.yahoo.com/brazilian-admits-killing-41-people-fun-163131467.html	Brazilian admits killing 41 people 'for fun'	Rio de Janeiro (AFP) - A Brazilian man accused of stabbing a woman to death in a Rio suburb has confessed to have murdered 41 people, almost all of them women, "for the fun of it," police said Thursday."He wanted to kill women -- white women, not black ones. He followed the victims, studying them closely before committing the crimes," said police commissioner Pedro Henrique Medina from the northern suburb of Nova Iguacu.The man was identified as Sailson Jose das Gracas, a 26-year-old whom police describe as a psychopath.They said they were checking his statements against past investigations, and so far they tally with the evidence.Gracas says he murdered 37 women, three men and a two-year-old child over a nine-year killing spree, explaining he killed the child because he feared it would cry and attract neighbors' attention."I observed them, I studied them. I waited for a month, sometimes a week, depending on the place. I tried to ascertain where they lived, what their families were like. I kept watch on their houses and then after a while went there at dawn, waited for my chance and entered," broadcaster Globo's G1 news portal quoted Gracas as saying.View gallery Sailson Jose das Gracas, 26, is escorted by policemen at a police station in Nova Iguacu near Rio de …He explained he started out as a petty thief."At 17, I killed the first woman and that gave me a buzz. I kept on doing it and I enjoyed it," he said, adding on one occasion a couple, Cleusa Balbina and her former husband Jose Messias, contracted him to kill someone for money. The pair are now under arrest.Gracas said he used a gun in contract killings but strangled his other victims.He planned his crimes meticulously, wearing a rain jacket in order to conceal his identity and gloves in order not to leave fingerprints, adding he became addicted to murder."When I wasn't killing someone I got uptight. I would pace up and down at home. Killing calmed me down."I'd kill someone and then would think about the victim for two or three months. After that, I'd go off hunting" for another victim, Gracas revealed."I don't feel remorse -- if I go to jail for 10, 15, 20 years, then as soon as I get out I'll do the same thing all over again," he insisted.Under Brazilian law, the maximum prison term is 30 years.The country has never had capital punishment.
http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2014/02/bill-clinton-regrets-rwanda-now-not-so-much-in-1994/	Bill Clinton Regrets Rwanda Now (Not So Much In 1994)	Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesOne of the newly released Clinton Library documents shows an administration scrambling to answer criticism of its handling of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda - a tiny African nation where nearly one million people were killed in the span of less than two months.The two-page memo from September 1994 - the genocide was in April and May of that year - featured talking points Clinton special assistant Tara Sonenshine drafted as preparation for an upcoming Washington Post interview with the president. The memo acknowledged that the interview was likely to be critical of Clinton's stance on Rwanda, blaming the failed "Black Hawk Down" intervention in Somalia the year before.In the memo, Sonenshine suggests the president refute that the U.S. experience in Somalia hindered his administration's Rwanda response."If anything, this is a case where our experiences in Somalia did NOT prevent us from doing the right thing," said the memo. "If we were truly spooked by Somalia we would have turned away entirely, instead of committing 4,000 American troops and spending $500 million to give the people of Rwanda humanitarian help and a breathing space. We put Somalia behind us and moved into Rwanda in full force."The memo also suggests the president argue that the United States took appropriate and swift action in Rwanda after it was clear there was genocide, and that the U.S. was one of many countries who authorized the United Nations to pull out of the country right before the atrocities began.In short, says the memo, the U.S. "did the right thing" and shares no responsibility for allowing the genocide to occur.Clinton himself echoed these sentiments in comments to the press a few months earlier where he said he had "done all he could do" to help the people of Rwanda, pointing out the United States had provided 40 percent of the total aid given to help the refugees from the conflict."We have worked on this for months. We are doing the best we can. We are going to do more," he said.But in the years since, the former President Clinton has called the failure to intervene in Rwanda one of his biggest regrets."I do feel a lifetime responsibility," he told ABC in 2008, while on a trip to the country. "I feel like a lot of people … had something to do with it."In March 2013 Clinton again talked Rwanda, when he told CNBC that he believes had the U.S. intervened, even marginally, at the beginning of the genocide at least 300,000 people might have been saved.

Some of these lesions can then morph into cancer."Pancreatic cancer develops from these lesions, so if we understand how these lesions come about, we may be able to stop the cancer train altogether," says the study's lead investigator, Peter Storz, Ph.D., a cancer biologist.The need for new treatment and prevention strategies is pressing, Dr. Storz says. Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive human cancers—symptoms do not occur until the cancer is well advanced. One-year survival after diagnosis is only 20 percent. It is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in this country.The scientists studied pancreatic cells with Kras genetic mutations. Kras produces a protein that regulates cell division, and the gene is often mutated in many cancers. More than 95 percent of pancreatic cancer cases have a Kras mutation.The researchers detailed the steps that led acinar cells with Kras mutations to transform into duct-like cells with stem cell-like properties. Stem cells, which can divide at will, are also often implicated in cancer.They found that Kras proteins in the acinar cells induce the expression of a molecule, ICAM-1, which attracts macrophages, a specific kind of immune cells. These inflammatory macrophages release a variety of proteins, including some that loosen the structure of the cells, allowing acinar cells to morph into different types of cells. These steps produced the precancerous pancreatic lesions."We show a direct link between Kras mutations and the inflammatory environment that drive the initiation of pancreatic cancer," Dr. Storz says.But the process can be halted in laboratory mice, he adds. "We could do this two ways—by depleting the macrophages or by treating the transformed cells with a blocking antibody that shuts down ICAM-1," says Dr. Storz. "Doing either one reduced the number of precancerous lesions."Dr. Storz noted that a neutralizing antibody that blocks ICAM-1has already been developed. It is being tested for a wide variety of disorders, including stroke and rheumatoid arthritis."Understanding the crosstalk between acinar cells with Kras mutations and the microenvironment of those cells is key to developing targeted strategies to prevent and treat this cancer," he says.Explore further: 'Achilles heel' of pancreatic cancer identified

They're not prepared to handle Ebola.""On his return visit to the hospital...Mr. Duncan was left for several hours not in isolation, in an area where other patients were present...The nurses raised questions and concerns about the fact that the skin on their neck was exposed. They were told to use medical tape wound around their neck that is not impermeable."The CEO admits the hospital was not ready for Ebola.A letter to the community reads, "despite our best intentions and skilled medical teams, we did not live up to the high standards that are the heart of our hospital's history, mission and commitment... Our focus is on the facts, and we are determined to get the answers as soon as we can."The letter also said the hospital is looking into how and why nurses Nina Pham and Amber Vinson contracted the disease.
http://www.voanews.com/content/us-ambassador-to-un-heads-to-ebola-stricken-west-africa/2496854.html	US Doctor: Ebola Quarantine May Deter Volunteers	A top U.S. medical official has warned that mandatory quarantines of health care workers returning from Ebola-affected parts of West Africa could discourage people from volunteering in the region.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN's State of the Union program Sunday that the best way to protect Americans is to stop the outbreak in Africa, and one of the best ways to do that is to help health workers who go there, rather than take measures that may "disincentivize them from going."   His comments follow new quarantine policies being imposed by three U.S. states. New York, New Jersey and Illinois have imposed a mandatory three-week quarantine for anyone returning from West Africa who had exposure to Ebola patients.New Jersey Governor Chris Christie defended his state's quarantine, calling it necessary "to protect the public health of the people of New Jersey."US ambassador to UNMeanwhile U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power landed in Conakry, Guinea, on Sunday to see first-hand how the global response is failing to stop the deadly spread of Ebola in West Africa.Power, who will also visit Liberia and Sierra Leone, said she hopes to gain a better understanding of which resources are missing so she can push other countries to offer more help.The three West African countries are bearing the brunt of the worst outbreak of the hemorrhagic fever on record that the World Health Organization (WHO) says has killed nearly 5,000 people. A small number of cases have also been reported in Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Spain and the United States.Ebola Cases and Deaths in West Africa as of October 19, 2014She told reporters on Saturday that the benefits of having first-hand knowledge of what is going on there far outweigh what she calls the "almost nonexistent risk."A small number of cases have also been reported in Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Spain and the United States.“We are not on track right now to bend the curve,” Power told Reuters. “I will take what I know and I learn and obviously provide it to President (Barack) Obama, who's got world leaders now on speed dial on this issue.“Hopefully the more specific we can be in terms of what the requirements are and what other countries could usefully do, the more resources we can attract,” she said.Lack of beds, medical staffAccording to the Africa Governance Initiative (AGI), even if existing international commitments are met by December, there could be a shortage of over 6,000 beds across Sierra Leone and Guinea.Nearly half of the beds currently planned in the three West African countries will lack the medical staff needed to support them, a study by former British prime minister Tony Blair's London-based development consultancy found.AGI based its projections on the WHO's worst-case scenario, which foresees 10,000 new cases per week in December.“The international community badly misjudged the impact of the Ebola epidemic in its first few months and is compounding that error by failing to act quickly enough now,” AGI's chief executive Nick Thompson said.He called upon more countries to follow the examples of the United States, Britain and Cuba, which have deployed military and medical personnel to the region to bolster efforts to stop the epidemic at its source.Power will visit Ebola coordination centers and meet with top government officials, U.S. health experts and military forces combating the disease.Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are at the center of the Ebola crisis, which has killed nearly 5,000 of the more than 10,000 confirmed and suspected cases.The WHO said the true numbers may be higher because many families have tried to treat patients at home.Ebola diagnostic testIn another development, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized the use of two new diagnostic developed tests by an American firm that can detect Ebola in a blood or urine sample in about an hour, compared to the 24 to 48 hours required for current tests. The FDA has been working with the Utah-based Bio-Fire to obtain the necessary performance data to grant the emergency authorization.Also Saturday, the United Nations flew one metric ton of emergency relief supplies to Mali after it reported its first Ebola death.A 2-year-old girl from Guinea died Friday in Mali, where she had gone for treatment.The WHO said the girl arrived by bus and may have exposed others in Mali to the disease.The World Food Program director for West Africa, Denise Brown, said speed is of the essence in the Ebola crisis.Meanwhile, Illinois Governor Pat Quinn has ordered a mandatory 21-day quarantine for so-called high-risk people arriving in the midwestern American state from Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone.The order covers anyone who had direct contact with an Ebola patient.Quinn said the protective measure is too important to be voluntary. The governors of New Jersey and New York have also ordered quarantines.The 21-day period marks the Ebola virus incubation period.President Obama urged Americans in his weekly Saturday radio address "to be guided by the facts, not fear" in the fight against Ebola. He again reminded Americans how difficult it is to catch the disease.Someone has to come in direct contact with an infected patient's bodily fluids to contract Ebola.Some material for this report came from Reuters.

Google ImagesThere was a time when a woman's greatest duty and achievement was taking care of her man. The women of the 2003 movie Mona Lisa Smile were a great example of what women in those days were essentially bred to do. They went to college, but they didn't really plan on using their degrees (or even graduating in some cases). The plan was to get married as soon as possible and put those Home Ec skills to good use!But today's breed of women is certainly a different one. Many historical events have lead to the evolution of the female role and Suzy Homemaker is now Ms. Independent. But just because certain "old-fashioned" ways have been phased out, doesn't mean they should be completely retired. You can still have your career and your own mind and what not, but maybe there are a few things that women just don't do anymore, that they should!So what do you think?

http://www.aol.com/article/2014/12/13/thousands-of-protesters-washington-nyc-police-killings/21115888/	Protesters of police killings march on DC	WASHINGTON (AP) - Thousands of protesters made their way down iconic Pennsylvania Avenue on Saturday, marching to the Capitol to call attention to the deaths of unarmed black men at the hands of police and call for legislative action.With signs reading "Black Lives Matter" and "Who do you protect? Who do you serve," the crowd gathered in Freedom Plaza before the march."Let's keep it strong, long and meaningful," Esaw Garner - the widow of Eric Garner, killed by an officer in New York City in July - told the group.The rally was interrupted briefly by more than a dozen protesters who took the stage with a bullhorn. They announced that they were from St. Louis and Ferguson, Missouri - where 18-year-old Michael Brown was killed by an officer - and demanded to speak.Large numbers of protesters on the ground supported the group, some chanting, "Let them speak."Ultimately, rally organizers allowed Johnetta Elzie of St. Louis to address the crowd. "This movement was started by the young people," she said. The group, mostly in their 20s, left the stage after she spoke.Organizers called the interruption unnecessarily divisive. But some in the Missouri group said they were disappointed and found the rally staid and ineffective."I thought there was going to be actions, not a show. This is a show," Elzie said.The Rev. Al Sharpton addressed the interruption and told the crowd, "Don't let no provocateurs get you out of line. ... We are not here to play big shot. We are here to win."Then, block after block of tightly packed people moved through the city. Organizers had predicted 5,000 people, but the crowd appeared to far outnumber that.Protests - some violent - have occurred around the nation since grand juries last month declined to indict the officers involved in the deaths of Brown and Garner, 43, who gasped "I can't breathe" while being arrested for allegedly selling loose, untaxed cigarettes in New York. Some protesters held signs and wore shirts that said "I can't breathe" Saturday.Politicians and others have talked about the need for better police training, body cameras and changes in the grand jury process to restore faith in the legal system.Terry Baisden, 52, of Baltimore said she is "hopeful change is coming" and that the movement is not part of a fleeting flash of anger.She said she hasn't protested before but felt compelled to because "changes in action, changes in belief, happen in numbers."Murry Edwards said he made the trip to Washington from St. Louis because he wants to make sure the momentum from the movement in Ferguson reaches a national stage."This is the national march," Edwards said. "We have to get behind the national movement."Sheryce Holloway, a recent graduate from Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, attended a smaller gathering outside Robert F. Kennedy Stadium in Washington ahead of the main rally. She said she also has been participating in protests at her alma mater.Holloway said the goal of the protests is "ending blue-on-black crime. Black lives do matter."Saturday's march is sponsored in part by the National Action Network, the Urban League and the NAACP. At the Capitol, speakers will outline a legislative agenda they want Congress to pursue in relation to police killings.While protesters rally in Washington, other groups including Ferguson Action will be conducting similar "Day of Resistance" movements all around the country. A large march is planned in New York City.____Online:Justice for All March http://nationalactionnetwork.net/march-police/National Day of Resistance: http://fergusonaction.com/day-of-resistance/More from AOL.com: 2016 contenders quiet on police shootings protests Defense satellite launches from California coast NYC police union wants mayor banned from funerals
http://mentalfloss.com/article/59251/11-wonderful-former-disney-rides	11 Wonderful Former Disney Rides	Since Disneyland's opening in 1955, and Disney World's in 1971, a lot of attractions have come and gone. Disney likes to hold on to its successful rides, but some were too costly, or just not popular enough; others were just collateral damage for newer and more exciting rides (the fact that Disney World's Mr. Toad's Wild Ride closed still stings). These rides are lost, but not forgotten. Let us look back at the nostalgic graveyard of defunct Disney rides. 1. Phantom Boats // Disneyland, 1955 – 1956davelandweb.comThis ride never stood a chance. Lasting just a year, its big problem was that it was too boring. Originally called the Tomorrowland Boats, this ride featured slowly moving white vessels that visitors could drive around the lagoon. On August 16, 1955, they were rechristened The Phantom Boats and redesigned with tailfins that were apparently a mechanical nightmare; the boats left park-goers stranded in the middle of the lake and undoubtedly very unhappy. The boats' last appearance was in the summer of 1956, making it the first ride to be removed from Disneyland.2. Submarine Voyage // Disneyland, 1956 - 1998davelandweb.comInspired by the USS Nautilus, the first nuclear-powered submarine, The Submarine Voyage replaced the Phantom Boats. Passengers could board the Disneyland Nautilus—or one of the other seven submarines—for a fanciful re-creation of the actual craft's journey to the North Pole. Although the submarines never actually went underwater, bubble jets gave the illusion of diving deeper and props were scattered throughout the track. Patrons could see sea monsters, turtles, glowing fish, and even mermaids. You can check out this video from 1959 to see what it was like:The ride stayed mostly the same for its duration, with the exception of a new coat of yellow paint in the mid-'80s. A similar ride opened in Disney World called 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea in 1971, and due to costs, the Florida ride was shut down in 1994, followed by the California version in 1998. The original Submarine Voyage was renovated to become a new ride. Today, you can hop in a submarine and see your favorite Disney fish in the Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage. 3. Flying Saucers // Disneyland, 1961 - 1966davelandweb.comThe Flying Saucers ride was sort of a mix between bumper cars and air hockey. Giant saucers big enough for an average-sized person to sit on were propelled across an arena by air valves; riders shifted their weight to direct the craft where they wanted to go. It was popular, but suffered from a lot of problems when larger guests tried to ride. As a result, it closed for good in 1966. Today, the spot is occupied by Space Mountain.4. Astro Jets // Disneyland, 1956 - 1966davelandweb.comLocated in the heart of Tomorrowland, this delightfully retro-futuristic ride gave patrons a great view of the park. Each rocket was big enough to snugly fit two riders and came with a lever that made it go up and down. Rocket Jets, a similar spinning ride with more modern-looking jets, eventually replaced the ride in 1967.5. Rainbow Mountain Stagecoach Ride // Disneyland, 1956 - 1959davelandweb.comThe stagecoaches in Frontierland gave visitors a chance to get the feel for transportation in the Wild West. After deciding whether to sit up top or inside, riders were transported back in time and through the Living Desert. The scenery featured balancing boulders, cartoonish cacti, and interesting rock formations. Unfortunately, the stagecoaches had a tendency to tip over and spook the mules; breakaway harnesses resulted in stranded passengers and missing mules—yikes!6. Rainbow Caverns Mine Train // Disneyland, 1956 - 1977 davelandweb.comThe mine train also went through the Living Desert, but unlike the stagecoaches, this ride brought its passengers into the rainbow caverns. Riders were transported through a beautiful cavern illuminated by beautifully colorful lakes and waterfalls. After the ride, patrons exited through the Mineral Hall, where rocks glow with the power of a black light. The ride was expanded in 1960, and became the Mine Train Through Nature's Wonderland. This new and improved ride now featured robotic animals, fossils, and Cascade Peak, a large mountain complete with waterfall. The ride was replaced by the rollercoaster Big Thunder Mountain Railroad in 1979, and most of the remnants have been bulldozed or removed. 7. Delta Dreamflight // Disney World, 1989 - 1998This ride aimed to encourage visitors to travel the world, and more importantly, to use Delta Airlines to do it. The attraction featured a hodge-podge of projection screens, animatronics, and pop-up storybook style sets. Passengers waited in an area fashioned to look like a terminal, and climbed into painted blue cars. The guests would then “take off” and travel through the ride. The ride was replaced by Buzz Lightyear's Space Ranger Spin in 1998. SEE ALSO: 13 Facts About Disney’s Haunted Mansion8. Adventure Thru Inner Space // Disneyland 1967 - 1985davelandweb.comPatrons of this ride would start by climbing into "Atommobiles." These cars would slowly enter a giant microscope, where the riders would then be "shrunk down" to microscopic size. (People waiting on line would watch the visitors ahead of them shrink and disappear.) After passing through the microscope, passengers were then shot into a snowflake. This simulation was created by moving the cars back and forth while bringing them through a dark tunnel. The tiny navigators emerged from the dark tunnel and were welcomed by gigantic falling snowflakes. As the riders shrunk in size, the sights changed: giant snowflakes became molecules, and molecules broke down to atoms. Up on top, a giant eye watched the ride through a microscope. The ride was eventually replaced by Star Tours in 1986.9. PeopleMover // Disneyland 1967 - 1995davelandweb.comThe PeopleMover was a lot like Florida’s Tomorrowland Transit Authority PeopleMover. Made to seem like the transportation mode of the future, these trains took patrons on a 16-minute ride around the park. The loading was done with some hustle: the train cars never stopped and doors closed automatically. After hopping inside, riders got a nice view of Tomorrowland. The ride was closed in 1995 in an effort to save money, but it remains standing.10. Flight to the Moon // Disneyland 1967 – 1975davelandweb.comPreviously called Rocket to the Moon, Flight to the Moon took place beside the Moonliner, the giant spaceship in the middle of Tomorrowland. At the time, the ship was the tallest thing in the park. The attraction inside was more like a simulation than a ride; visitors would sit in chairs surrounded by projectors, and the chairs would vibrate as the screens showed images of the moon. In 1975, the ride changed to Mission to Mars since, by then, humans had already been to the moon. No word on what the next iteration will be when we finally make it to Mars. 11. Journey Into Imagination // Disney World 1983 - 1998 Loren JavierLike many other Disney rides, this one has seen many different incarnations. The current ride is called Journey into Imagination with Figment, but Figment didn’t always have such a large role. In the original ride, the passengers glided through what seemed like clouds. A bearded man with a top hat and goggles would fly over to the guests and introduce himself as “Dreamfinder.” He drove a contraption that collected dreams and the guests came along for the ride. The visitors are shown multiple rooms with different themes, like art, literature, and science. Today, the ride focuses on the five senses and Figment is in every scene (although Dreamfinder is nowhere to be found).
http://www.vox.com/2015/8/20/9181909/space-tourism-cost	Why space tourism is going to be utterly disappointing	People have been dreaming about space tourism for nearly a century. Think of the orbiting space hotels in 2001: A Space Odyssey, or the Martian visits in Total Recall. Years before anyone had ever even been to space, people were thinking of vacationing there.Now billionaires like Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson have poured tons of money into building vehicles for space tourism — and it seems possible that sometime in the next few years, one of their companies will become the first to carry paying passengers into space.Suborbital flights will cross the 100-km Karman line that marks the bottom of space — but won't go much higher. (SpaceFuture.com)But there's a catch. Their plans merely involve flights into suborbital space: high enough up to technically cross the 100-kilometer line considered the lower boundary of space and give fliers a few minutes of weightlessness, but not high enough to actually enter Earth's orbit like a satellite or the International Space Station.The sad reality is that Virgin flights, currently priced at $250,000 for an estimated six minutes of weightlessness, might not provide an experience tremendously different from what's currently available to anyone willing to spend $5,000: a brief zero gravity flight on a plane often called the "vomit comet."Now, all these companies — along with Elon Musk's SpaceX — have vague plans to eventually bring tourists all the way into Earth's orbit, but experts say it's a long shot. "Fundamentally, it's all very hard to do," says John Logsdon, founder of the Space Policy Institute. "We've been launching people into space for 54 years now, and less than 600 people have made the trip. I think the idea that there's some magic bullet that could open up orbital space to large numbers of people is illusory."The hard truth is that we're closer to the era of space tourism than ever before — but if you're waiting for vacations in space, you'll probably be disappointed.The X Prize jump-started the space tourism industry"The idea of space tourism has been bandied about, at least in science fiction, since the 1920s," Paul Milo, author of Your Flying Car Awaits — a book about 20th-century speculation on future technologies — told me for an article last year. "In the 1960s, there was this perception that by the 21st century, space tourism — whether a stint aboard an orbiting hotel or a trip to the moon — would be as common as a flight from New York to Tokyo."The main reason that isn't the case is money. After the moon landing and the perception that the US had won the space race, Congress's funding for NASA dried up significantly in the 1970s. For decades, dreams of space tourism went nowhere, as space travel remained far too expensive and risky.That began to change in the late 1990s, when a pair of entrepreneurs created the X Prize: a standing offer of $10 million to the first private organization that created a reusable spacecraft. In 2004, the prize was won by Burt Rutan, who twice flew his spaceplane, SpaceShipOne, to an altitude of more than 100 kilometers — and in doing so, scraped the bottom edge of space.SpaceShipTwo would scrape the bottom edge of space, giving passengers six minutes of weightlessness. (American Museum of Natural History)Soon after, Richard Branson licensed the technology for use in developing a similar craft (SpaceShipTwo) that could carry paying passengers to the same altitude, allowing them to experience zero gravity and see the curvature of Earth from space. But though his new company Virgin Galactic has generated lots of hype — and got about 700 people to sign up for the waiting list for the $250,000 flights — it has had to repeatedly push back its timetables for commercial flights. Most recently, plans had called for them to begin in the spring of 2015, but a crash that destroyed the sole SpaceShipTwo in existence and killed one of the co-pilots has caused delays.To date, just seven people have gone into space as tourists — and they were all carried there on existing flights operated by the Russian space agency, paying $20 million to $40 million each for weeklong stays on the International Space Station. Even these flights have been put on hold (mainly because NASA will pay more to reserve those spots for American astronauts), but they're expected to start back up in late 2015.We might finally be getting close to spaceflight for touristsAfter many years of delays, there's some reason to think that at least suborbital tourist flights might be around the corner.For one, the field has recently become crowded with a number of legitimate, well-funded companies. Apart from Virgin, Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin has quietly been working on its own suborbital rocket. After a few failed test flights, it finally conducted its first successful one earlier this year, sending it to an altitude of 93,000 meters — just below the lower edge of space.Eventually, the company says, its New Shepard craft will be able to carry three people into suborbital space, for tourism and research purposes.Meanwhile, the California-based company XCOR Aerospace began developing a series of spaceplanes for the same purpose in 2008. It still hasn't conducted any actual flights, but last month the company raised the price of future flights on its Lynx craft from $100,000 to $150,000, promising that test flights will soon follow.Virgin has seemingly moved on from its crash and appears to be the farthest along in development. A federal investigation largely blamed Scaled Composites (the company contracted to design and test SpaceShipTwo) for the disaster, and Virgin reportedly plans to begin testing an improved replacement craft later this year.But there are some good reasons for skepticismWreckage from the 2014 Virgin crash. (Sandy Huffaker/Getty Images)On the other hand, it seems that we've been just a few years away from commercial flights for some time now.In 2008, for instance, Virgin founder Richard Branson predicted commercial flights would begin sometime in 2009. In 2012, the company's CEO, George Whitesides, said they'd start in 2013. When XCOR debuted its spaceplane design in 2008, it was supposed to fly by 2010; in 2012, it was supposed to fly in 2013.You get the idea. "It's always the same number, but it never gets any closer," says space expert Howard McCurdy.Still, he believes that suborbital flights will eventually happen, given the number of companies involved and the large pool of wealthy people willing to pay for the thrill. Virgin and others have some technical problems to solve (most importantly, the aerodynamic difficulties of decelerating a plane from 2,600 miles per hour to landing speed), but they're doable, given enough money.The Virgin crash, however, was a painful reminder of the inherent risks of space travel: after decades of research, about 5 percent of rocket launches still end in failure. For a purely recreational flight, this number might be too high for many would-be space tourists to swallow.At the same time, McCurdy points out that even though 1 percent of the people who attempt to climb Mount Everest die, about 1,000 still attempt it each year. "The extreme adventure market carries substantial risk, but that doesn't keep people off Everest," he says. If Virgin or another company can approach this 1 percent figure, many thrill seekers might be willing to fly.Why the next step in space tourism might never happen(MGM)These companies' hope is that once they start flying people into suborbital space, they'll make enough money to fund the development of orbital spaceflight. That would eventually lead to true space tourism à la 2001: space hotels, weeklong zero-gravity vacations, the whole shebang.But even though suborbital flight and this sort of spaceflight might seem similar, from an engineering perspective they're vastly different. Right now, Virgin and XCOR are trying to fly a plane to a relatively high altitude, then coast back down. But it's essentially impossible to reach orbit this way because you can't reach the high speeds necessary."For a suborbital flight, you only have to accelerate to Mach 3 or 4. For an orbital flight, it's Mach 25," says Logsdon. "The energy difference needed to reach that speed is exponential." To date, everyone who's ever gone to orbit has gotten there with a vertically launching rocket.But rocketry is the rare technology that has seen barely any advancement in the last 50 years. The rockets being used to launch satellites and astronauts today aren't all that different from the one that put Sputnik in space in 1957. Both involve large tubes that burn fuel, expelling huge amounts of gas to push the payload into orbit, and then fall away, breaking into pieces and disintegrating.The problem with this model is that it makes orbital spaceflight really expensive. Elon Musk has famously likened it to throwing away a brand new 747 after a single flight to London. Because of the one-use model, NASA has to pay Russia more than $80 million for each astronaut it carries up to the International Space Station, after retiring its own space shuttles in 2011. If a company wants to carry out flights primarily for tourists, it'd have to drive down this price significantly.The most obvious way to do so would be to figure out how to make that rocket reusable, instead of throwing it away after each launch. This is why SpaceX keeps trying to land its rockets vertically: A new Falcon 9 rocket costs $54 million, but the fuel needed to relaunch only costs about $200,000.SpaceX's April rocket landing attempt was the closest one yet.SpaceX still hasn't managed to land a rocket, but it's made a bit of progress toward the goal — and though its main business is conducting launches for the government, it could eventually enter the space tourism field. However, even if it managed to reuse a rocket, there'd be another big hurdle before it could be viable for orbital space tourism: It will need really fast turnaround between flights.At the moment, it'd take a huge number of engineers many months to fully refurbish a Falcon 9 rocket for the next flight. NASA's Space Shuttle — which included a reusable spaceplane launched atop a pair of reusable rocket boosters — was the closest anyone has come, but it took 19,000 engineers several months to refurbish all the equipment for the next flight. All this labor meant it ended up costing even more than the traditional method of spaceflight: launching a capsule atop a disposable rocket.Here's what you can actually expect on your spaceflightGiven these difficulties, what can we realistically expect for the future of space tourism? In all likelihood, Virgin, XCOR, Blue Origin, or another company will eventually achieve suborbital flights, offering wealthy flyers the chance to scrape the bottom edge of space for a few hundred thousand dollars.For many people, that raises an obvious question: Is it worth it? It's hard to say, since no tourists have taken this sort of flight yet. But thousands have gone up on Zero-G "vomit comet" plane flights, initially developed by NASA in the 1950s as a means of training astronauts and now offered by a handful of companies.The Zero G plane flies in a series of parabolas to induce a feeling of weightlessness. (Zero Gravity Corporation)During each flight, a plane goes in a series of parabolas, diving steeply downward to produce a feeling of weightlessness for several 30-second periods. It's certainly not spaceflight, but it's the closest analogue we have to the "several minutes of weightlessness" Virgin promises for the future — far closer than the weeklong stay at the International Space Station a handful of tourists have had from Russia.When I spoke with several Zero-G passengers, I found that they generally found it to be a fascinating, unique experience — but perhaps not a life-changing one."You're lying down, and then all of a sudden, you begin to feel your limbs lift up on their own," says Maraia Hoffman, who worked as an in-flight coach for the company. "It was just a weird, amazing feeling," says Cynthia Emmons, who took a flight in 2007. "I couldn't help but keep laughing the whole time.""I wouldn't call the weightlessness life-changing," says Miriam Kramer, a space reporter for Mashable who took the flight for a 2013 article. "It was fun, but it was so quick." Though Zero-G says its flights are short enough to prevent nausea, Kramer also notes that, at least among her passenger group, the plane still lived up to its vomit comet nickname.Suborbital flight probably won't give you a new perspective of EarthA prototype of the Virgin Galactic cabin. (Daniel Berehulak/Getty Images)Of course, there's one big difference between suborbital spaceflight and the vomit comet: The former will offer passengers the chance to look down from about 10 times higher and see the curvature of Earth. Space tourism companies hope that will induce the so-called overview effect. Many astronauts have reported that seeing Earth from above — isolated as a marble floating in space — gave them a profound sense of awe and a dramatically different perspective on life.But even though suborbital flights might come closer to providing this experience than Zero-G, they won't allow for a full-on overview of Earth. "At 100 miles up, you are just skimming the surface and you don’t get a feeling for the Earth as a whole," astronaut Michael Collins said in 1986. On Virgin's SpaceShipTwo, you'll be peering through 17-inch-wide portholes to see out. And these flights won't necessarily even reach 100 miles — the lower boundary of space is just 62 miles up. The space station, by contrast, is 250 miles from Earth.Still, these passengers and space experts believe there's a market for suborbital flights. "I can totally see the average person being really interested in it and wanting to experience it, as much for the aura of spaceflight as the experience itself," Kramer tells me.You'll have to be superrich to afford it(Mark Greenberg/Virgin Galactic/Getty Images)At the same time, even if one of these companies succeeds in operating regular flights — and thereby driving down the price — we're still talking about hour-long flights, providing a few minutes of weightlessness, that will costs hundreds of thousands of dollars. And if orbital tourism ever happens, tickets will certainly cost millions. Both options might eventually get cheaper, but there's absolutely no way either will soon be accessible to the average person.That brings us to what may be the most disappointing aspect of the future of spaceflight: its elitism. More than anything, spaceflight seems poised to become a new status symbol for the superrich."The odd thing about the space tourism business is that it's based on the assumption of income inequality, of intense concentrations of wealth," says McCurdy. "There might be a market for it, but it makes you ask: Is that really the kind of society that we really want to live in?"Correction: This article previously stated that a suborbital craft would have to decelerate from 17,000 miles per hour, rather than 2,600 miles per hour.

http://autos.yahoo.com/news/toyota-supra-successor-cost-more-corvette-report-140004021.html	Toyota Supra Successor To Cost More Than Corvette: Report	Toyota is working with BMW on a new sports car platform that will eventually be used by the Japanese automaker for a Supra successor, which has been previewed by the series of FT-1 concept cars. BMW has been quiet on its plans for the platform but is currently thought to be using it for a replacement for its Z4. While both cars are still a couple of years away—their respective reveals should take place before 2017—we now have some information that may hint at the price tags we can expect for them.MUST SEE: Man On Rocket-Powered Bicycle Sets World Record, Smokes Ferrari In the Process: Video Car and Driver, citing an inside source, is reporting that Toyota’s new sports car will likely cost more than a Corvette, which starts at about $55k with shipping. This would make sense if Toyota’s new sports car comes with an advanced hybrid system, as is the rumored case, but would seem rather expensive if the car ends up getting a more conventional powertrain. This also raises the question of what kind of money BMW’s new sports car will demand. It’s very likely that the BMW will sell at a premium to the Toyota but such pricing would make the car more of a rival for the Jaguar F-Type and entry-level Porsche 911 variants than a direct replacement for the Z4, which starts at just below $50k.DON'T MISS: First 2015 Chevy Corvette Z06 Convertible Crashed If accurate, then BMW’s new sports car is likely to be positioned higher than the current Z4, which would tie in with reports that the new car may be labeled a Z5 and feature improved performance in line with its higher positioning.

http://news.yahoo.com/netherlands-says-ok-biker-gangs-fight-islamic-state-155136559.html	Netherlands says OK for biker gangs to fight Islamic State	The Hague (AFP) - The Dutch public prosecutor said on Tuesday that motorbike gang members who have reportedly joined Kurds battling the Islamic State group in Iraq are not necessarily committing any crime."Joining a foreign armed force was previously punishable, now it's no longer forbidden," public prosecutor spokesman Wim de Bruin told AFP."You just can't join a fight against the Netherlands," he told AFP after reports emerged that Dutch bikers from the No Surrender gang were fighting IS insurgents alongside Kurds in northern Iraq.The head of No Surrender, Klaas Otto, told state broadcaster NOS that three members who travelled to near Mosul in northern Iraq were from Dutch cities Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Breda.A photograph on a Dutch-Kurdish Twitter account shows a tattooed Dutchman called Ron in military garb, holding a Kalashnikov assault rifle while sat with a Kurdish comrade.Video footage apparently from a Kurdish broadcaster shows an armed European man with Kurdish fighters saying in Dutch: "The Kurds have been under pressure for a long time."Many countries including the Netherlands have been clamping down on their nationals trying to join IS jihadists who have taken over swathes of Iraq and Syria.Measures include confiscating would-be jihadists' passports before travelling and threatening prosecution should they return."The big difference with IS is that it's listed as a terrorist group," said De Bruin."That means that even preparing to join IS is punishable."Dutch citizens could not however join the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), as it is blacklisted as a terrorist organisation by Ankara and much of the international community, De Bruin said.Dutch citizens fighting on the Kurdish side would of course be liable to prosecution if they committed crimes such as torture or rape, De Bruin said."But this is also happening a long way away and so it'll be very difficult to prove," said De Bruin.

Bruce Braley's (D-Iowa) name gave her campaign a boost.The first lady made headlines last week after she referred to the four-term congressman as "Bruce Bailey" seven times.During an interview on Sean Hannity's radio show Monday, Ernst poked fun at her opponent's endorsement speech gone wrong."Wow, that was great for my campaign." Ernst chuckled. "That's one of the first tenets of having somebody come in to stump for you. They really should know who you are."Hannity laughed along with Ernst and took his own stab at a stump speech for the Republican candidate."I'd like to welcome 'Joni Earnests' to the podium to be the next senator for the great state of Iowa," Hannity said, while Ernst laughed in the background.The first lady also mistakenly referred to Braley as a Marine Corps veteran who previously worked as a trial lawyer. She most likely intended to reference his father, Byard Braley, who fought in World War II at the Battle of Iwo Jima.Hannity suggested Obama got confused with Ernst, who served over 20 years in the Iowa Army National Guard as a lieutenant colonel."She was very confused that she had to be corrected by the audience on his name as well as the fact that he's not a Marine," Ernst said. "He has never served his nation in the armed forces a single day."Obama wasn't the only politician to confuse Braley's name. Former President Bill Clinton accidentally called Braley, "Bill" at a steak fry in September hosted by Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa).Former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who stumped for Ernst last week, joked about Clinton's error in his speech."I know that Iowa voted for President Obama twice, but Iowa is not going to vote for 'Bill Braley' and vote for him a third time, that's for sure," said Romney.
http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nascar-from-the-marbles/power-rankings--kevin-harvick-s-win-keeps-him-in-second-163505661.html	Power Rankings: Kevin Harvick's win keeps him in second	Our Power Rankings are far from a scientific formula. In fact, it's the perfect blend of analytics and bias against your favorite driver. And you think we dislike your favorite driver, so it makes sense, right? Direct all your complaints to us at happyhourmailbag@yahoo.com.1. Joey Logano (LW: 1): We're not going to move the points leader from the top spot of Power Rankings after finishing fourth, even if the guy in second was the one who won the race. We're not that cruel and callous. However, we feel that we need to point out that this is the final few days of Logano's points lead until potentially after Martinsville. Enjoy it while you have it, Joey!2. Kevin Harvick (LW; 2): While Logano can spend the entire Talladega race as Brad Keselowski's wingman if Team Penske so chooses, Harvick doesn't have a team dilemma. He's the only SHR car left in the Chase. Of the 12 Chase drivers, he's in the best spot. Want to run in the back all day and just kill time? Harvick can do it. Want to go for the win and say screw it? Harvick can do that too. The potential consequences of a crashed car exist either way.3. Kyle Busch (LW: 3): The top three is unchanged and do you blame us? Busch finished fifth and is second in the standings (a point ahead of Harvick). Busch was very straightforward with his Talladega strategy after the race, saying that he simply wanted to survive and let the mayhem happen in front of him. It's not a bad idea. He's got a 26-point cushion over Matt Kenseth, which means he can finish 28th if Kenseth finishes second.4. Jeff Gordon (LW: 4): OK, the top four is unchanged. This is what happens when they all finish in the top five. Gordon finished second, and while we all wondered how the race could go bad for Harvick on the green-white-checker restart, was the wondering tampered a bit with the possibility of a #GordonRestart? Plus, Harvick had the best car all day and we know that Gordon's success has come on long green flag runs.5. Kyle Larson (LW: 6): Here's where it gets crazy. The next seven spots are going to be jumbled up and Larson moves up after finishing sixth. And he even hit the wall earlier in the race. There's no denying that Larson is running well and it's absolutely no fluke. However, one has to wonder if the good finishes are being artificially enhanced. A precocious rookie driver with a bunch of acknowledged potential being the best non-Chase driver over the final 10 races is too perfect of a storyline.6 (TIE). Carl Edwards and Ryan Newman: We have a tie in Power Rankings because Edwards and Newman can't seem to escape each other this Chase. Saturday night, Newman was seventh while Edwards was eighth. The biggest gap between the two drivers in terms of finishes so far in the Chase has been five, when Newman finished 15th while Edwards was 20th. In the other four races, they've finished within, at most, three positions of each other and have finished in consecutive spots for the past two races.8. Denny Hamlin (LW: 11): Here's the video of what TV cameras didn't capture during Saturday night's telecast. After Hamlin and Brad Keselowski drove into the garage, they drove through the garage stalls in the garage building. Hamlin was following Keselowski, the two cars stopped, and that's where Keselowski gave the car some gas to get away from Hamlin.After the kerfuffle – if you want to call it that – the two continued on to where they ended up and Hamlin had to be restrained from going after Keselowski.9. Brad Keselowski (LW: 5): If you watch the video closely, yes, Keselowski lays down rubber onto the garage stall floor with his rear tires, but his car doesn't accelerate out of the building like a rocket. And given that Hamlin was forcibly restrained from going after Keselowski when they finally got out of their cars, do you blame Keselowski for not wanting to be in a garage? Does the loud sound of the engine amidst the relative silence of cars off and coasting make the video worse than it appears? What if this same thing happened just out in front of the garage? There's a lot of interesting things to consider here if you think there should be penalties.10. Matt Kenseth (LW: 7): If it's any consolation for missing the third round of the Chase if you don't qualify at Talladega, Matt, you gave us the GIF of the year with your ninja-like attack on Keselowski between the haulers. The most impressive thing about it may not be Kenseth's speed, but the way that he didn't touch the camera operator in the narrow walkway on the way to get Keselowski.11. Jimmie Johnson (LW: 8): Johnson was the first car to pit for tires before the green-white-checker restart and restarted 10th. So he finished in the top five, right? Nope. He ended up 17th. Kind of crazy, isn't it? Even if Johnson held serve, he's still in basically the same position at Talladega. 50 points isn't much different than 57. A lot of things still have to happen for Johnson to advance if he doesn't win.12. Dale Earnhardt Jr. (LW: 12): Maybe Junior and Jimmie should just be an inseperable tag-team on Sunday. They're tied in the standings, so they might as well go at it together, right? Or at least until the last lap when it's every driver for himself. You can't exactly have team orders to decide who will be leading and who will be pushing in a two-car draft between the two. (A coin-flip seems unfair.) Oh, and look what actually exists and is soon available. Lucky Dog: Jamie McMurray. He out-pointed his young teammate on Saturday, finishing third.The DNF: Clint Bowyer. Last. Engine failure.Dropped out: N/A- - - - - - -Nick Bromberg is the editor of From The Marbles on Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?

The United Nations Refugee Agency reported Wednesday thousands have died just this year attempting to travel to safety by sea. And the Mediterranean is the most dangerous sea route of all.According to the U.N., more than 200,000 people have made Mediterranean sea crossings this year - that's triple the number from 2011. Of those 200,000 people, nearly 3,500 have died along the way. (Video via Google Earth)In Geneva, Switzerland, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres said many people are fleeing their country in "despair" as they've been driven out by "conflict and persecution."Take Syria, for instance. 3.2 million Syrians have been displaced since the beginning of the country's civil war, which began in 2011. (Video via CBS)But there's another problem: Guterres said countries receiving refugees have the wrong attitudes about sheltering foreigners: "Focusing only on border control and deterrence will not solve the problem. It is the duty of any government to ensure security and to manage immigration, but these policies must be designed in a way that human lives do no end up becoming collateral damage."Although, Guterres said countries must do more at a time when an "unprecedented number of people" are fleeing their home countries for safety, he added there are several organizations helping to mitigate the number of refugee lives lost at sea.The Italian Navy reportedly saved more than 160,000 lives this year as a part of a rescue initiative. And 408 migrants, mainly Syrians, were recently rescued by a Spanish vessel and an Icelandic ship after drifting six days in the Mediterranean. (Video via CNN / Italian Navy)Also this week, governments meeting in Geneva pledged to collectively take in 100,000 Syrians due to what Guterres called an ongoing "humanitarian challenge."This video includes images from Getty Images.

So far this year, we have seen major breaches hit the health-care and federal government verticals in particular, but which vertical takes the cake for being the biggest hacker target? Using data and filings compiled by the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, CRN has run the numbers on data breaches both big and small and figured out which vertical was hit the most this year. The verticals were ranked by number of breaches, as many companies don't disclose how many records were affected.  While health care and the federal government are obviously big targets right now, the answer of the most targeted vertical and how the industries stack up might surprise you.

http://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/fox-obama-seeks-advice-establishing-monarchy	Fox: Obama Seeks Advice on Establishing Monarchy	Photograph by Olivier Douliery/PA Wire via APWASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—President Barack Obama spent several hours on Monday in a closed-door Oval Office meeting seeking advice on how to establish a monarchy, Fox News reports.According to Fox, the President peppered his Oval Office guest with detailed questions about the mechanics of setting up a monarchy and was curious about the perks and powers that go along with it.Obama’s guest advised him that establishing a monarchy would probably require rewriting or even replacing the Constitution, an option that Obama reportedly said would be “difficult, but doable.”Introducing a note of caution, the guest urged the President to alter the Constitution so that it vested the monarch with genuine power, adding, “You don’t want to wind up being a figurehead who just goes around visiting foreign dignitaries and so forth.”According to the Fox report, the President came away “intrigued” by the meeting and said he would explore the idea further next week when Congress is on vacation.Get news satire from The Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.

http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/09/26/heroin-krokodil-flesh-rotting-arrives-us-arizona/2879817/	Flesh-rotting 'krokodil' drug emerges in USA	Two cases in Arizona are the first involving caustic, heroin-like IV drug that originated in Russia.A powerful heroin-like drug that rots flesh and bone has made its first reported appearance in the United States, an Arizona health official says.Known on the street as "krokodil," the caustic homemade opiate is made from over-the-counter codeine-based headache pills mixed with iodine, gasoline, paint thinner or alcohol. When it's injected, the concoction destroys a user's tissue, turning the skin scaly and green like a crocodile. Festering sores, abscesses and blood poisoning are common.Frank LoVecchio, the co-medical director at the Banner Good Samaritan Poison & Drug Information Center, told KPHO-TV that Arizona health officials have seen two cases during the past week."As far as I know, these are the first cases in the United States that are reported," he said. "So we're extremely frightened."LoVecchio did not say where in the state the patients were located or provide details about their conditions.The drug — chemically called desomorphine — emerged around 2002 in Siberia and the Russian Far East but has swept across the country in just the past three years, according to a Time magazine investigation.Krokodil became popular in Russia because heroin can be difficult to obtain and is expensive. Krokodil costs three times less, and the high is similar to heroin though much shorter, usually 90 minutes.The average life expectancy among krokodil addicts in Russia is two to three years, according to Time, which called the narcotic "the most horrible drug in the world." Gangrene and amputations are common, and the toxic mix dissolves jawbones and teeth, much like the methamphetamine that Walter White cooks in Breaking Bad.As with all intravenous drug addicts, krokodil users are susceptible to HIV, hepatitis C and other blood-borne diseases, and have compromised immune systems.One recovering Russian krokodil addict, Irina Pavlova, told Time in 2011 that she injected the drug almost daily for six years. She has a speech impediment and impaired motor skills because of the resulting brain damage.Her brother was among the dozen or so addicts she shot up with. "Practically all of them are dead now," she said. "For some, it led to pneumonia, some got blood poisoning, some had an artery burst in their heart, some got meningitis, others simply rot."A Russian woman using krokodil in June 2011 told The Independent that a fellow junkie refused to go to the hospital."Her flesh is falling off and she can hardly move anymore," she said.Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1atqJsK
http://news.yahoo.com/kcna-north-korean-leader-makes-public-appearance-220826661.html	Lessons on N. Korean stagecraft in Kim's absence	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Even when Kim Jong Un was nowhere to be seen, he was everywhere.From "Saturday Night Live" spoofs to the wild theories of journalists across the globe trying to parse his five-week absence from the public eye, the 30-ish leader of North Korea captured nearly as many headlines as he did when he threatened to nuke his enemies last year.The mystery ended Tuesday when Kim appeared in state media, smiling broadly and supporting himself with a cane. While touring the newly built Wisong Scientists Residential District and another new institute in Pyongyang, Kim "took necessary steps with loving care," a dispatch early Tuesday from the official Korean Central News Agency said in typical fawning style. The North didn't say when the visit happened, nor did it address the leader's health.This bewildering ability to command attention by doing nothing says a lot about the North's mastery of a propaganda apparatus that puts Kim at the center of everything. Remove for 40 days the sun around which that propaganda spins and the international media, both traditional and social, explode with speculation and rumors.It also speaks to the fundamental difficulties everyone outside North Korea — academics, government officials, reporters — faces in understanding what's really happening inside a small, poor, autocratic country that jealously guards its internal workings as it ignores demands by the U.S. and its powerful allies to give up its nuclear bombs.It is no mistake that the world obsesses about Kim's extended time off from his usual, seemingly constant series of inspection tours of factories and frontline military bases. Ever since 1948, when Kim's grandfather, Kim Il Sung, founded the country as a socialist rival to the U.S.-backed South, the Kim family has successfully sold the notion, at home and abroad, that they are North Korea.View gallery A man watches a TV news program showing North Korean leader Kim Jong Un using a cane during his firs …The last time Kim had been seen in state media was at a Sept. 3 concert. In the weeks between, he missed several high-profile events that he normally attends. An official documentary released late last month made a single reference to Kim's "discomfort" and showed video footage from August of him overweight and limping.Many analysts believe that while Kim may have some health issues, he's probably not in serious trouble. But many other people wondered while Kim was out of the spotlight."Is Kim Jong Un brain dead?" a South Korean lawmaker asked Adm. Choi Yoon-hee, head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, during a parliamentary hearing Monday. Choi said no, and, without elaborating, said Kim's health problems "are not severe enough to disrupt his status as the ruler of the country."There were many reasons to believe that even before he reappeared.No unusual troop movements or other signs of a possible coup have emerged. Diplomacy at the highest level continues: Three members of his inner circle made a surprise visit to the South, something analysts say would be impossible without the leader's blessing. Foreign tourists and aid workers still travel to the North, and there have been no reports of new restrictions or warnings for diplomats.View gallery People watch a TV news program showing photographs of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's first pu …There's also nothing particularly unusual about North Korean leaders laying low for extended periods. Kim's late father, Kim Jong Il, no fan of the limelight in his later years, would disappear at times; Kim Jong Un, who seems to genuinely like being at the center of things, took off without a word for three weeks in 2012.But the apparent vanishing act of a man long seen in foreign media as a cartoonish, all-powerful overlord sitting on a nuclear arsenal while his people starve has proven endlessly fascinating. And while there is plenty of informed analysis from experts and frequent visitors to Pyongyang, there seems to be even more thinly sourced speculation.Kim is, by turns, reported to be suffering from gout, from diabetes, from a brain hemorrhage, from a heart ailment, from a leg injury that required surgery from a French doctor, from mental illness or, according to a head-turning British report, from a cheese addiction.North Korea's completely controlled state media, meanwhile, chugged right along.Kim is always seen in dispatches as the benevolent wellspring of all that is good and powerful. Archived footage of him plays regularly on state TV.View gallery FILE - In this July 27, 2013 photo, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un waves to war veterans during a m …"Within North Korea, the people feel Kim's presence even when he is absent," Scott Snyder, a Korea expert with the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in a recent blog post. "Externally, North Korean propaganda has made Kim's presence so critical that international media regard his absence as disquieting, even ... without supporting indicators of instability or upset in Pyongyang."Maybe the speculation comes from South Korean officials eager to undercut the Kim family's legitimacy, Adam Cathcart, a University of Leeds history lecturer, suggested in a recent online post he titled "North Korea Misinformation Bingo" that listed various "theories." Maybe it's North Korea's attempt to change the subject from its human rights abuse? Maybe it's "driven by cutthroat competition in the online journalism sector"?The source is anyone's guess, Cathcart wrote, but two things are certain: There are lots of rumors floating around, and "most of them are probably wrong."Part of the interest in Kim's absence stems from worries about what would happen to the country if the leader died without securing a succession.Kim Jong Un emerged as the anointed successor after Kim Jong Il disappeared from public view in 2008 — by most accounts because of a stroke. The elder Kim died in late 2011.Kim Jong Un's two older brothers, for whatever reasons, were deemed unfit to rule by Kim Jong Il, and little is known about his sister.Kim's disappearance from the public eye "does not appear likely to shake the regime, but it reveals the vulnerabilities the regime faces," Snyder said.Kim reportedly does have a direct heir who may one day extend the Kim dynasty into a fourth generation. Probably not soon, though. She's believed to be a toddler.___Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung in Seoul contributed to this report.___Follow Klug, AP's Seoul bureau chief, on Twitter at twitter/apklug

It could have been a million times worse,” Christina Kurylo said, according to Global News. “I could have died, you know, you never know what could have happened. … All of a sudden I got hit in the head. It was pretty confusing for me. It’s bits and pieces for me after that.”Air Canada Express Flight 8481 took off from Calgary on Thursday evening for a short flight to Grande Prairie when a tire burst and the captain was diverted to Edmonton for an emergency landing.When the twin-engine Bombardier Q400 touched down, the right landing gear collapsed, one of the propellers broke off, pierced the aircraft and hit Kurylo.“All of the sudden there was a big bang,” said Melissa Menard, who along with Kurylo were among a group of Rock 97.7 radio station workers from Grande Prairie, Alberta, aboard the 75-person flight.Menard said passengers had not been told to brace in crash position for the landing, which at first felt normal, The Globe and Mail reported.“Just from the blow of it happening, she had quite a huge head lump and it was quite purple and lots of bruises and scratches,” Menard said.Melissa MenardPhoto: FacebookKurylo was treated at the University of Alberta Hospital for a concussion and bruising. Three other passengers were treated and all have been released.The other 67 passengers and four crew members were evaluated at the scene, according to Jazz Aviation, which provides service as Air Canada Express.A Jazz Aviation official said the company is not worried about the sturdiness of the aircraft.“The Q-400, both the original and the next-generation aircraft, are extremely robust,” said company vice president David Deveau.

The find suggests that dinosaurs advanced quickly across the globe after a mass extinction claimed at least half of all species on Earth, researchers say.This new fossil, the first named dinosaur unearthed from northern South America, also provides evidence that dinosaurs lived in herds early on in their evolution, and were able to dwell in regions previously thought too inhospitable for dinosaurs to survive.The new dinosaur is named Laquintasaura venezuelae. Laquintasaura is Greek for "lizard of La Quinta," the rock formation where the reptile was discovered in the Andes, while venezuelae refers to the country of Venezuela, where the dinosaur was unearthed. [See Images of the Newfound Little Dinosaur]The dinosaur was about 3 feet long and only stood up to about 1 foot high. Judging by its teeth, it was an omnivore."The teeth are very unusual, with a tall, narrow triangular outline, tips that are slightly curved backward, coarse serrations along the margins and thin ridges that extend up and along the crown," said lead study author Paul Barrett, a vertebrate paleontologist at the Natural History Museum in London. "This combination of features is unknown in any other dinosaur. Although the triangular shape and coarse serrations suggest that plants made up most of the diet, the tall outline is reminiscent of meat-eating teeth, as are the slightly curved tips, so it is possible that Laquintasaura took small prey such as large insects some of the time."Laquintasaura was an ornithischian or "bird-hipped" dinosaur, an early relative of titans such as duck-billed hadrosaurs, the armored stegosaurs and ankylosaurs, and three-horned Triceratops. The other major dinosaur lineage were the saurischian or "lizard-hipped" dinosaurs, which included giant long-necked sauropods such as Brachiosaurus and predatory theropods such as Velociraptor and T. rex. (Birds actually evolved from saurischians, not the so-called bird-hipped ornithischians.)Laquintasaura lived about 200 million years ago, "placing it in the earliest part of the Jurassic period, a time when dinosaurs were just starting their ascent to global dominance," Barrett told Live Science.This dinosaur was alive soon after the end-Triassic mass extinction event. This mass extinction was one of the big five mass extinctions to affect life on Earth the most recent one, the end-Cretaceous, which was about 67 million years ago, ended the age of dinosaurs. Dinosaurs originated about 230 million years ago, in the late Triassic, but only achieved global dominance beginning 30 million years later, after the cataclysmic end of the Triassic. [Wipe Out! History's 7 Most Mysterious Extinctions]"In many ways, this extinction was a major help to dinosaurs, as it killed off a number of other reptile groups that might have been competitors," Barrett said. "Laquintasaura is known only 500,000 years after the extinction, and shows that ornithischians were quick off the mark during this recovery period."Recently, scientists have unearthed a trove of early saurischian dinosaurs, such as meat-eating Eodromaeus and plant-eating Eoraptor. However, early ornithischian fossils have proven quite scarce this new discovery helps fill a major gap in what scientists know of dinosaur evolutionary history.At least four specimens of Laquintasaura were uncovered together. This finding suggests that ornithischians may have practiced herd behavior early in their evolution. Until now, complex social behavior among ornithischians was confirmed only in dinosaurs of the Late Jurassic onward, dozens of millions of years after Laquintasaura was alive.In addition, Laquintasaura apparently lived near the equator, which past research suggested was inhospitable to dinosaurs."Climate models had suggested that the equatorial regions may have been isolated from other regions by extensive deserts on either side, which may have acted as a barrier to prevent large animals reaching this region," Barrett said. "However, plant fossils from the area, and the discovery of Laquintasaura, suggest that the climate must have been capable of supporting at least some animals for at least part of the year, though it's unclear just how hospitable the area was all year round."A couple of fossil teeth the researchers discovered from another species "demonstrate that a meat-eating dinosaur was also present, but these teeth are the only evidence that we found for such an animal. No other fossils from other animal groups have been found," Barrett said.Many other details remain unknown about what the area was like when this dinosaur lived."Some of the rocks in the general area of the discovery represent semiarid environments, while others indicate more swampy environments," Barrett said. "The climate would have been hot, but the amount of water would have varied through time."In the future, "it would be interesting to do more work on the specific environment that the bones come from, as well as the processes that concentrated the bones into the rich jumbled layer that was found," Barrett said.The scientists detailed their findings online Aug. 6 in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.
http://www.voanews.com/content/philippines-ferry-sinks-at-least-21-missing/2448957.html	2 Dead, Several Missing in Philippines Ferry Sinking	Rescuers are searching for possible survivors of a ferry that sank overnight in the central Philippines, leaving at least two dead.Officials said Sunday that around 100 people were rescued by passing vessels after the Maharlika II sank in a sudden storm after leaving Liloan port in Southern Layte province.  Authorities are continuing to search for survivors because they are unsure of how many people were on board the ferry.A spokesman said the Maharlika II sent a distress call after its rudder broke, leaving the vessel stalled as it was battered by heavy waves and high winds.The accident took place as tropical storm Kalmaegi was passing to the north toward the South China Sea.  But Coast Guard spokesman Armand Balilo told reporters there were no storm warnings as far south as Southern Leyte when the accident occurred.Scores, sometimes hundreds of people die each year in ferry accidents in the Philippines; an archipelago of more than 7,000 islands with a notoriously bad record of maritime safety.  Overcrowding is common aboard inter-island ferries, many of which are poorly maintained.Some information for this report comes from AP, AFP and Reuters.

http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-19/china-s-building-a-huge-canal-in-nicaragua-but-we-couldn-t-it	China's Building a Huge Canal in Nicaragua, But We Couldn't Find It	Deep on the southeastern side of Lake Nicaragua, along a bumpy dirt road that climbs gently through lush-green forest, sits the tiny town of El Tule. It is quintessential rural Central America: Chickens roam outside tin-roofed homes while pigs stand tied to trees, awaiting slaughter; the sound of drunk locals singing along to ranchera music greeted visitors on a recent weekend afternoon.The village, if you listen to Nicaraguan officials, is a key point in what will be the biggest infrastructure project the region has ever seen, the construction of a $50 billion canal slated to run 170 miles from the country’s east to west coast. Awarded two years ago by President Daniel Ortega to an obscure Chinese businessman named Wang Jing, the concession calls for El Tule to be ripped up, erased essentially, in order to make way for the canal right before it plunges into the lake and then meets the Pacific Ocean a few miles later.The idea is that the waterway will attract many of the larger vessels that the Panama Canal — located just 300 miles to the southeast — has historically struggled to accommodate. A construction deadline of 2020 has been set. Yet a four-day tour through El Tule and surrounding areas slated for crucial initial development only seemed to corroborate the belief, harbored by many analysts inside and outside Nicaragua, that this project isn’t going to get done.The tiny town of El Tule in Nicaragua. Photographer: Susana Gonzalez/BloombergThe townspeople haven’t seen any signs of canal workers in months. And the work that was done was marginal. A handful of Chinese engineers were spotted late last year making field notations on the east side of the lake; early this year, a dirt road was expanded and light posts were upgraded at a spot on the west side where a port is to be built.Juharling Mendoza, a 32-year-old local entrepreneur, is so convinced that the project won’t proceed that he’s constructing a two-story house with three guest rooms and an attached convenience store just outside of El Tule. He says bluntly: “There isn’t going to be a canal.”It is true, as supporters of the canal quickly point out, that public works of this magnitude tend to move in fits and starts. The Panama Canal itself was decades in the making. However, for a project that made so little sense to so many skeptics from the very beginning, the almost non-existent initial progress — along with the struggles to raise financing — is only fanning those doubts.Sverre Svenning, a shipping expert at Oslo-based Fearnley Consultants AS, notes that Panama’s current $5 billion canal expansion will allow it to better accomodate today’s bigger tankers. Overall traffic, he says, isn’t strong enough to sustain a second route. And then there are the massive engineering and environmental challenges to overcome, like making sure the country’s volcanos don’t disrupt the canal, according to Eric Farnsworth, vice president of the Council of the Americas. “I’m very skeptical,” he said.A Google earth map presented by HKND Group shows — in red — where the canal will cut through Nicaragua.Conspiracy TheoriesMany people doubt that Ortega — a former guerrilla who rose to international fame when he defeated U.S.-backed forces in the 1980s — and his Chinese partners ever truly intended to build a canal. Conspiracy theories abound as to what their real intentions are. It has become something of its own cottage industry. A small sampling: The project is a land grab by Ortega; or a tool to whip up support ahead of next year’s elections; or a Chinese plan to threaten U.S. hegemony in the region by mapping out infrastructure designs so close to its shores.While Wang, a billionaire who made his fortune largely in the telecom industry, hasn’t received official public backing from Beijing, China watchers say it’s unlikely he’d have signed such a deal without getting the green light at first from home. In extending its influence throughout Latin America and the rest of the developing world, China’s record on these mega projects is spotty. Several have been put on hold long after companies began the work, like a $3.5 billion resort in the Bahamas and a $1.3 billion refinery upgrade in Costa Rica.Back in a 2013 interview, Wang made it clear he was aware of the public perception. “I don’t want it to become a joke or an example of a failed overseas Chinese enterprise,” he said.In response to questions this week, Wang’s Hong Kong-based HKND Group said construction of the port on the Pacific Coast will begin this year, a position echoed in Managua by Manuel Colonel Kautz, the head of the country’s new canal authority. HKND said it’s waiting for the Nicaraguans to sign off on the environmental impact study before proceeding and that it’s held talks with companies across the globe looking to invest. Ortega’s press office declined to comment.The $50 billion canal would be the biggest infrastructure project the region has ever seen with the waterway slated to run 170 miles from Nicaragua's east to west coast. Photographer: Susana Gonzalez/BloombergVanderbilt’s FailureThe dream of a canal cutting across Nicaragua dates back centuries. Before Teddy Roosevelt and the Americans settled on Panama, Nicaragua was the top pick for an inter-oceanic waterway that would end the need for ships to make the long trek around Cape Horn. Railroad magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt even took a shot at building one in the 1850s. The mast of his dredge boat still stands as a symbol of that failure, rising out of a lagoon in southeast Nicaragua.The job looks no easier today really than it did then.It will require 16 million cubic meters of concrete, nearly one million tons of rebar and steel and the excavation of 4 billion cubic meters of rock and soil. Nearly all of these materials — as well as the bulldozers and cranes — will have to be imported, HKND says. The $50 billion price tag is almost five times the annual economic output in Nicaragua, the poorest nation in Central America.‘Go Away’In a country with little independent polling, it’s hard to gauge support for the project. Traveling along the canal route last month, the most common concerns heard were about eviction and, to a lesser extent, the environmental impact.In Rio Grande, a town along the Pacific Coast, Antonia Ponce was adamant that she’s not moving. “Only over my dead body,” she said. Her 19-year-old granddaughter, Tatiana, then pulled out a sign she made last year when the Chinese workers showed up to work on the road. In Chinese lettering surrounded by an axe and machete, emblems of the Nicaraguan countryside, it reads: “Go Away, Chinamen.” A resident holds his land contract near the Hacienda Miramar, where work has started on the canal in Rio Grande, Nicaragua. Photographer: Susana Gonzalez/BloombergBut the overriding sentiment on the ground was skepticism.A few miles to the west of Rio Grande, in a village where oxen-pulled wooden carts pass through empty dirt streets, a rancher named Jose Mena Cortez said he’s seen all this before — the bold promises from politicians of public works and growth. “They always come with big plans,” he said. “And they never do anything.”—With Haixing Jin

Heavy gunfire and flashbangs could be seen and heard during the assault.Iranian Man Monis, 50, is believed to be the lone suspect in the incident, which began around 9:45 a.m. Monday morning, according to reports.Police dismissed the notion the attack was part of a larger plot, calling it "an isolated incident" and saying Monis had no terror affiliations. No terrorist organizations have come forward to claim responsibility for the incident.Two men, aged 50 and 34, and a 38-year-old woman were pronounced dead Tuesday morning after being taken to local hospitals, according to a police press release.Monis is among the people who died in the barrage of bullets that brought the standoff to an end, police said during a Tuesday morning press conference.A woman was shot in the shoulder, she is being treated at a local hospital. Two other women and a male police officer suffered non-life-threatening injuries. The cop sustained a "wound to his face from gunshot pellets," authorities said.Another woman was taken to the hospital as a precaution.Victims were seen being escorted away from the scene on foot and also wheeled away on stretchers. Footage also showed CPR being performed on at least two people.A total of 11 people had reportedly escaped by the time authorities decided to bring the standoff to an end. Officials had previously spoke of bringing the ordeal to a peaceful conclusion.Early reports suggested there could have been as many as 50 people trapped inside the Lindt chocolate shop, but authorities have confirmed 17 people accounted for, including the three deaths.Several loud bangs were heard as armed officers opened fire on the cafe. More hostages fled as the scene more resembled a war zone than the central business district of Australia's largest city.Monis infamously threatened explosive devices were planted around Sydney, that claim was proved false by police.

http://www.inquisitr.com/1688355/giudice-residence-raided-by-feds-cash-and-christmas-gifts-seized/	Giudice Residence Raided By Feds, Cash And Kids’ Christmas Gifts Seized	Teresa Giudice and her husband, Joe, are looking to serve out their prison sentences after having been found guilty on numerous fraud charges. Now, their Christmas just got a whole lot worse as their family home was raided by federal agents this week, who seized property, including cash and even Christmas gifts.An inside source told Radar Online, “Plasma televisions, expensive jewelry, cash, and even the kids’ Christmas presents were taken. Teresa was home and was absolutely stunned by the raid. She had no clue they were coming. She was absolutely hysterical, and begging them not to take the girls’ Christmas presents.”Unfortunately for her, Teresa’s pleas to the agents fell on deaf ears, and things went from bad to worse when the feds found a stash of cash in the wine cellar.The surprise raid comes after the Real Housewives of New Jersey couple failed to “submit any payment plan for the outstanding $214,000 they owe in restitution,” the insider said. “As such, prosecutors were eager to get the property seized.”The source added that the Giudice residence will most likely be sold off, with the proceeds of the sale being put into a trust account, “The property will now be auctioned off with the money going into a trust account. If there is any money left over, it would go to paying creditors in their bankruptcy, in which they owe $14.3 million,” the source revealed.Apparently, the situation would not have arisen, according to the source, if Teresa would have submitted a reasonable payment plan.“This all could have been avoided if Teresa had simply submitted a proposed plan to pay off the restitution. Yet, Teresa chose to once again thumb her nose at the law, and was ignoring it.”Sadly, Teresa and Joe are not the only victims here, as their children are drawn into the situation facing the family.The source added, “She is absolutely devastated that there won’t be any Christmas presents for their girls.”

They have forfeit their conservatorship over their daughter. on.aol.comAmanda Bynes has made some new shocking allegations against her dad. While confirming that her parents are indeed moving back to Texas, Bynes accused her dad of possibly fathering her sister Jillian's baby. On Tuesday, Amanda Bynes posted an old picture of herself and Jillian with a disturbing caption about the paternity of her sister's baby to Instagram.Amanda Bynes/InstagramBynes has made multiple accusations about her father in recent months. Aside from claims that her parents are trying to take her money, Amanda also has made claims that her father abused her and continues to leer at her and make her uncomfortable. The most recent though, regarding the paternity of her sister Jillian's baby is pretty shocking. The picture was captioned, "My parents plan on moving back to Texas to be with my ugly family. My sisters expecting her first child with Brandon but I think my father is really the baby's daddy - the timing adds up !"Each time Bynes has taken to social media to attack her dad with claims of molestation and abuse, hours later she posts a rebuttal. For example, a photo of Amanda Bynes' father was posted to her Instagram account on Nov. 5 with the caption, "FYI If you see this man then call the police and hide your children he belongs in jail for the rest of his perverted life." Just hours later the same photo was posted with a different caption. This time it read, "My father never touched me I just wanted my belongings and control over my finances again so I can move to nyc and become the person that im becoming and have some more plastic surgery so I can be pretty for my soon to be husband!"Previous accusations about Amanda Bynes' father have been posted to Twitter but then deleted soon after. Amanda took to Twitter just one month ago and posted a series of Tweets about her father Rick Bynes. The now deleted tweets included, "My dad fondled himself in front of me so many times that i started recording him on my phone in hopes of catching him saying or doing something inappropriate around me so I could get him arrested & put in jail for the rest of his perverted life."Amanda claimed that her mother knew of the abuse and did nothing to stop it. She even claimed that she was seeking a restraining order against her dad. As with all the other times that Amanda claimed her dad abused her, before deleting the entire series, she claimed that her micro chip made her do it. So far, Amanda Bynes hasn't refuted her most recent claim that her dad might have fathered her sister's baby.

http://news.yahoo.com/immigrants-warning-drivers-licenses-160810263.html	Immigrants get warning on driver's licenses	LOS ANGELES (AP) — While tens of thousands of immigrants living in the United States illegally are preparing to apply for a long-sought driver's license in California starting Jan. 2, others are being urged to think twice.Immigrant advocates say the vast majority should be able to get licenses without trouble, but they want anyone who previously obtained a driver's license under a false name or someone else's Social Security number to speak first with a lawyer, fearing a new application could trigger a fraud investigation.The same applies to immigrants with a prior deportation order or criminal record because federal immigration officials and law enforcement can access Department of Motor Vehicles data during an investigation.The advice isn't meant to frighten immigrants from seeking licenses that are meant to make their lives easier — especially because many already risk getting ticketed simply by driving to work or taking their children to school."For the vast majority of people, getting a license is a good decision," said Alison Kamhi, staff attorney at the Immigrant Legal Resource Center. "At the same time, I think it is important people are aware there is some risk."The nation's most populous state is preparing to start issuing driver's licenses to immigrants in the country illegally in a bid to make the roads safer and ease fears for more than a million people. California's program eclipses the scope and scale of those approved in nine other states, including Nevada, Colorado and Illinois.California expects 1.4 million people to apply for the licenses — which include a distinct marking from those issued to U.S. citizens and residents — over the next three years. The number of people making license appointments more than doubled to 379,000 during the first two weeks immigrants were allowed to sign up.Immigrant advocates said they don't foresee major problems with the rollout of the program because the state has had more than a year to prepare and an ample budget — $141 million spanning three years.In Nevada, about 90 percent of immigrants failed the required written test during the first few weeks a driver authorization card was offered this year because they were not prepared. In Colorado, the state had no startup funding to issue licenses this year and couldn't keep pace with demand, leading to monthslong waits.Jonathan Blazer, advocacy and policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation, said he expects California to license as many immigrants in the country illegally as the nine other states, Washington D.C., and Puerto Rico combined."If California is not able to do this right with the resources it put into this, other states will take notice," Blazer said.Critics have voiced security concerns and questioned the ability of state officials to verify immigrants' identities.Like other applicants, immigrants will need to prove their identity and residency in the state. Those who don't have a passport or consular identification card on a pre-approved list can submit other documents for review by a DMV investigator to see if they qualify.Mexican consulates and advocacy groups have been hosting driver's license preparation classes for months. Demand has been high."The sooner the better, because it will be safer to drive," said Abel Rivera, a 37-year-old from Mexico. He also hopes to qualify for better insurance coverage.
http://news.yahoo.com/test-cause-spike-illness-cases-kids-172801018.html	New test to bump up diagnoses of illness in kids	NEW YORK (AP) — For more than two months, health officials have been struggling to understand the size of a national wave of severe respiratory illnesses caused by an unusual virus. This week, they expect the wave to start looking a whole lot bigger.But that's because a new test will be speeding through a backlog of cases. Starting Tuesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is using a new test to help the agency process four or five times more specimens per day that it has been.The test is a yes/no check for enterovirus 68, which since August has been fingered as the cause of hundreds of asthma-like respiratory illnesses in children — some so severe the patients needed a breathing machine. The virus is being investigated as a cause of at least 6 deaths.It will largely replace a test which can distinguish a number of viruses, but has a much longer turnaround.The result? Instead of national case counts growing by around 30 a day, they're expected to jump to 90 or more.But for at least a week or two, the anticipated flood of new numbers will reflect what was seen in the backlog of about 1,000 specimens from September. The numbers will not show what's been happening more recently, noted Mark Pallansch, director of the CDC's division of viral diseases.Enterovirus 68 is one of a pack of viruses that spread around the country every year around the start of school, generally causing cold-like illnesses. Those viruses tend to wane after September, and some experts think that's what's been happening.One of the places hardest hit by the enterovirus 68 wave was Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri. The specialized pediatric hospital was flooded with cases of wheezing, very sick children in August, hitting a peak of nearly 300 in the last week of the month.Mother of Enterovirus Patient Describes How Limbs  …Play videoBut that kind of patient traffic has steadily declined since mid-September, said Dr. Jason Newland, a pediatric infectious diseases physician there."Now it's settled down" to near-normal levels, Newland said. Given the seasonality of the virus, "it makes sense it would kind of be going away," he added.The germ was first identified in the U.S. in 1962, and small numbers of cases have been regularly reported since 1987. Because it's not routinely tested for, it may have spread widely in previous years without being identified in people who just seemed to have a cold, health officials have said.But some viruses seem to surge in multi-year cycles, and it's possible that enterovirus surged this year for the first time in quite a while. If that's true, it may have had an unusually harsh impact because there were a large number of children who had never been infected with it before and never acquired immunity, Newland said.Whatever the reason, the virus gained national attention in August when hospitals in Kansas City and Chicago saw severe breathing illnesses in kids in numbers they never see at that time of year.Health officials began finding enterovirus 68. The CDC, in Atlanta, has been receiving specimens from severely ill children all over the country and doing about 80 percent of the testing for the virus. The test has been used for disease surveillance, but not treatment. Doctors give over-the-counter medicines for milder cases, and provide oxygen or other supportive care for more severe ones.The CDC has been diagnosing enterovirus 68 in roughly half of the specimens sent in, Pallansch said. Others have been diagnosed with an assortment of other respiratory germs.As of Friday, lab tests by the CDC have confirmed illness caused by the germ in 691 people in 46 states and the District of Columbia. The CDC is expected to post new numbers Tuesday and Wednesday.Aside from the CDC, labs in California, Indiana, Minnesota and New York also have been doing enterovirus testing and contributing to the national count. It hasn't been determined if or when the states will begin using the new test, which was developed by a CDC team led by Allan Nix.Meanwhile, the virus also is being eyed as possible factor in muscle weakness and paralysis in at least 27 children and adults in a dozen states. That includes at least 10 in the Denver area, and a cluster of three seen at Children's Mercy, Newland said.Online:CDC: http://tinyurl.com/ofcvgh7
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/10/16/bidens-youngest-son-leaves-navy-amid-drug-report/20979673/	Sources: Hunter Biden leaves Navy after drug test	WASHINGTON (AP) - Hunter Biden, the youngest son of Vice President Joe Biden, has been kicked out of the military after testing positive for cocaine, two people familiar with the matter said Thursday.The Navy said that Biden, a former lobbyist who works at a private equity firm, was discharged in February - barely a year after he was selected for the part-time position as a public affairs officer in the Navy Reserve. Citing privacy laws, the Navy did not give a reason for the discharge, which was not disclosed until it emerged in the media on Thursday.In a statement released by his attorney, Biden said he respected the Navy's decision and was moving forward with his family's love and support. He did not give a reason for his discharge."It was the honor of my life to serve in the U.S. Navy," Biden said. "I deeply regret and am embarrassed that my actions led to my administrative discharge."The vice president's office declined to comment. Hunter Biden's attorney didn't respond to inquiries about whether Biden had used cocaine.Two people familiar with the situation said Biden, 44, was discharged because he failed a drug test last year. They weren't authorized to discuss the incident by name and requested anonymity. The Wall Street Journal first reported Biden's discharge and failed drug test.An attorney by training, Biden applied to join the Navy Reserve as a public affairs officer and was selected in 2012 - one of seven candidates recommended for a direct commission for public affairs. A board of senior Navy officers interviewed Biden before making the recommendation.Because he was 42 at the time, he needed a special waiver to be accepted. Cmdr. Ryan Perry, a spokesman for the Navy, said Biden had been assigned to the Navy Public Affairs Support Element East, based in Norfolk, Virginia.The terms of Biden's separation from the Navy were unclear. Typically, military members discharged for failing drug tests don't receive an honorable discharge.The vice president speaks about his children frequently during public appearances. In December, Hunter Biden and one of his daughters accompanied the elder Biden on a trip to Asia, where the vice president praised his son's work around the world as the chairman of the World Food Program USA."I'm so incredibly proud of him," Vice President Biden said.Earlier this year, Hunter Biden raised eyebrows when he joined the board of a private Ukrainian gas company, just as his father and the Obama administration were working to wean Ukraine off Russian energy. At the time, the vice president's office brushed aside questions about the arrangement by saying that the younger Biden was a "private citizen."Biden, a managing partner at investment firm Rosemont Seneca Partners, has three children. His older brother, Beau Biden, is Delaware's attorney general and an Army National Guard member who served a yearlong deployment in Iraq.

Credit: US Coast Guard, Prentice DannerIn the depths of the Arctic Ocean, buried deep in the sediment, an ancient creature waited for over a million years to be discovered. Paul Valentich-Scott, from the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History (California), and three scientists from the United States Geological Survey (USGS, Menlo Park, California), Charles L. Powell, Brian D. Edwards, and Thomas D. Lorenson were up to the challenge. Each with different expertise, they were able to collect, analyze, and identify a new genus and new species of bivalve mollusk.The path to discovery is seldom simple or easy. This discovery is no exception. Brian Edwards was the chief scientist on a joint US-Canadian ice breaker expedition aboard the US Coast Guard Cutter Healy in the summer of 2010. The primary purpose of the expedition was to map the Arctic seafloor and the sediments beneath. Dr. Edwards took deep sediment core samples to further understand the geology of the region including the unusual seafloor mound where these samples were collected. In several of these cores he uncovered bivalve seashells buried nearly 15 feet (4.5 m) below the seafloor surface.Upon returning to his USGS laboratory in Menlo Park, California, Brian worked with Tom Lorenson on sampling the cores and extracting the shells. The recovered shells were then taken to USGS paleontologist Chuck Powell, for identification. While Chuck was able to ascertain the higher level classification of the clam shells (Family Thyasiridae), he was unable to determine the genus or species. Chuck contacted Paul Valentich-Scott, a clam specialist from the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History in California.When examining these ancient shell specimens, Paul was fairly certain that they were new to science. The hunt to validate the potential new species was on. Paul contacted a number of thyasirid bivalve specialists around the world and all gave it a thumbs up as a new species. Further, several scientists felt it also might be a new genus (the level above species).'It is always exciting when you are the first person to be looking at a new creature' declared Valentich-Scott. 'While I have been fortunate to discover and describe many new species in my career, it is always exhilarating at the outset.'Then the painstaking work began. Paul contacted museums around the globe and requested to borrow specimens that were potentially related to the new species. While he found many species that shared some characteristics, none matched the new Arctic specimens.The four scientists have been writing up their findings for the past two years and now the work has been published in the international science journal ZooKeys.The new genus and species is named after two individuals. The genus is named in honor of Dr. Thomas R. Waller a prominent paleontologist at the Smithsonian Institution. The suffix "concha" meaning shell, is combined to create the name Wallerconcha. The new species is named after Sara Powell the daughter of co-author Chuck Powell. Chuck was quick to mention "I want to name new species after all of my children."While many of the specimens collected were definitely fossils, the scientists can't discount the new animal might still be alive today. One of the team members, Tom Lorenson, summarized it this way 'The likely collection of living specimens of this species awaits expeditions to come.' Who knows what other new creatures might be found in those expeditions?Explore further: Lost and found: New beetle collected by Darwin 180 years ago published on his birthdayMore information: Valentich-Scott P, Powell II CL, Lorenson TD, Edwards BR (2014) A new genus and species of Thyasiridae (Mollusca, Bivalvia) from deep-water, Beaufort Sea, northern Alaska.

http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/clippers/2014/04/28/donald-sterling-clippers-naacp-alice-huffman/8411441/	Donald Sterling's donations to NAACP led to latest award	LOS ANGELES -- Donald Sterling donated money for years to the Los Angeles chapter of the NAACP, which honored the Clippers owner with a lifetime achievement award in 2009 and was planning to present him another in May until the controversy broke over his racially insensitive comments that went public over the weekend.The amount Sterling has given to the L.A. NAACP branch was not revealed at a news conference Monday held by L.A. branch president Leon Jenkins."It's an insignificant amount of money, and we're going to return it," said Jenkins, who added the NAACP and Sterling have had a relationship for "maybe 15-20 years."PREVIOUSLY: NAACP won't present award to SterlingMORE: NBA to hold news conference TuesdaySterling's award from the NAACP in 2009 came just before he agreed to pay a $2.765 million settlement in a case that alleged he discriminated against African Americans, Latinos and others at apartment buildings he owned in Los Angeles County.The NAACP no longer plans to honor Sterling at its event next month, at which Rev. Al Sharpton and L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti will receive awards as Persons of the Year."There is no place in my town for any racist company," Garcetti said Monday on CNBC. "We don't want to see leadership of any company here that's not welcome in Los Angeles. And we absolutely won't tolerate it. Those comments were despicable. I hope that the very strongest sanctions are levied by the league against the owner if it is proven that that indeed is Donald Sterling."Late Monday a protest group of 11 young black males showed up in front of Los Angeles' Staples Center, home to the Clippers (and the Lakers), hoping at least some fans boycott Tuesday's playoff game between the Clippers and Golden State Warriors. Their motto: "If you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything."Jenkins, however, said he won't ask Sterling to return the 2009 award."This is not like the Heisman Trophy, dude," he said. "He has the award. We're not going to ask him to return an award that he got years ago."Jenkins said the NAACP decided to honor Sterling because of "a body of work. Mr. Sterling's organization has on a consistent basis brought in the minority community. He has also over the years contributed to a number of minority charities. Compared to other L.A. franchises, his organization gave more money than the others."The president of the California branch of the NAACP was stunned when she got an invitation recently from the L.A. unit to its May gala honoring Sterling.In an interview Monday with ESPN Radio's Colin Cowherd, Alice Huffman said she was surprised Sterling was being given another lifetime achievement award.MORE: Sterling not likely to be ousted as owner"I thought to myself, 'A second lifetime award? That's kind of unusual. He hasn't died and come back to life. He already has one lifetime award. Why the second one?' And then this story broke," said Huffman.Huffman said it is not unusual for local chapters of the NAACP to receive donations from corporations and individuals and then hand out awards to those people."The local branches of the NAACP can choose people they have a close relationship with and if their executive committee agrees, they can give that person an award," Huffman said."As I recall, the (L.A.) branch took a little heat for that award in 2009. The branch president pointed out that the litigation was going on and was not conclusive, and therefore he did not want to prejudge. They went ahead and gave him the award.WATCH: STERLING'S RACIST COMMENTS NOT NEW IN SPORTS WORLDYou can add Donald Sterling to a list of sports world figures whose insensitive and racist comments put their jobs in jeopardy. (USA TODAY, USA NOW)"What the world doesn't know about an organization like the NAACP is that we are all volunteers," Huffman said. "We don't have a funding stream to support our activities across this country. Every local unit has to go and raise its own funds. We sort of have to work with corporations."But you have to have integrity. You can't let the color of the money taint what you should be doing. I tell people who contribute to me, 'If we can support you, we will. But you cannot buy the NAACP. We are not for sale. But we appreciate your support, because we make America a better place.' "Garcetti, on CNBC, said the city is behind the Clippers players."Let me first say to the players that are the Clippers, I want to tell them that this city is behind them. They are welcome in this town and that we are rooting for them. I think they have been lost in the mix of all of this. And this is a fabulous team of great, bright stars. And this city is 100% behind you, especially as you prepare" for playoff games.Other than Sharpton and Garcetti, NAACP honorees in May include Charles Patton, a retired attorney, who is to receive a lifetime achievement award; Shannon Brown, Federal Express executive; Javier Angulo, Wal-Mart executive; Leland Spencer, restaurant owner and Hester Watkins, retired educator.PHOTOS: Donald Sterling through the years
http://www.inquisitr.com/1600031/stephen-colbert-slams-climate-change-deniers-im-not-a-scientist-argument-video/	Stephen Colbert Slams Climate Change Deniers’ ‘I’m Not A Scientist’ Argument [Video]	Stephen Colbert is tired of the often-heard “I am not a scientist” excuse from politicians who continue to deny that climate change has anything to do with man. Colbert took particular issue with the idea that Sen. James Inhofe (R – Okla.) is slotted to take over the leadership role in the Environment and Public Works Committee. Inhofe wrote a book about climate change in 2012 entitled The Greatest Hoax and is a fervent climate change denier.Colbert described the book as being “like Harry Potter for people who thought Harry Potter had too much science in it.”But Colbert didn’t just take issue with Inhofe. Focusing on George P. Bush, Colbert took down the many Republican leaders who use the oft-repeated phrase, “I am not a scientist” in order to evade direct questions on their views on climate change.And Colbert isn’t the only one who is tired of hearing it.As the New York Times reported, the “I am not a scientist” or some variation thereof has become the automatic statement when Republicans were questioned about climate change during the 2014 midterm campaigns. In the past, Republicans openly questioned or flat-out denied all the science behind climate change, but since recent polls show that the majority of citizens accept the fact that climate change is real and man-driven, and furthermore support policies crafted to slow or halt the process — Republicans have found it increasingly difficult to continue to deny it.Hence, the “I’m not a scientist” sound byte heard from so many Republican candidates and politicians, especially as the 2016 presidential elections loom closer.Michale McKenna is a Republican energy lobbyist who has advised Republicans on energy and climate change messaging, and even he agrees that the argument is weak and invalid.“It’s got to be the dumbest answer I’ve ever heard,” said McKenna. “Using that logic would disqualify politicians from voting on anything. Most politicians aren’t scientists, but they vote on science policy. They have opinions on Ebola, but they’re not epidemiologists. They shape highway and infrastructure laws, but they’re not engineers.”One man who conducts polls on public attitudes towards climate change finds the “I’m not a scientist” phrase to be strange and useless.“What’s odd about this ‘I’m not a scientist’ line is that there’s nothing in the data we’ve seen to suggest that this helps a candidate,” he said. “We can’t find a single state where the majority of voters are skeptical. To say, ‘I’m not a scientist’ is like saying, ‘I’m not a parakeet.’ Everyone knows that it just means, ‘I’m not going to talk about this.'”Colbert, however, is a little more blunt about what he thinks is the meaning behind the statement, saying that those who say it really all mean the same thing: “We don’t know what the f*ck we’re talking about.”But whether or not Republicans are willing to admit to their own views on climate change during an interview — if they confirm James Inhofe, who claims climate change is a giant hoax, as leader of Environment and Public Works Committee — it seems as though they will be speaking clearly enough.As Colbert said, “You don’t have to worry about global warming anymore, because the Senate sure won’t.”For more on the impact of climate change, click here.[Image via the Colbert Report]

Here's his full update:There is no cure for Ebola yet, but the chairman for the CDC said earlier this month that he is "confident" the United States will not experience an Ebola outbreak.Fellow tech billionaire Bill Gates announced last month that his foundation would give $50 million to fight Ebola, the largest donation that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has ever made to a humanitarian cause.CORRECTION: This post previously misidentified the number of people infected with Ebola. It has been fixed.
http://mashable.com/2015/08/19/queen-elizabeth-ii-badass-facts/	11 badass facts about the Queen that might surprise you	LONDON – It's a well-documented fact that Queen Elizabeth II is a living British legend, but not everyone knows that she's also a total badass as well.See also: Queen off-roads to get past slowcoach family like a total badassOn September 9, Queen Liz will officially become Britain's longest reigning monarch and with that in mind we've rounded up some facts, each one of them arguably more badass than the last.1. She doesn't need a passport to travelYep, that's right: because all passports in Britain are technically issued in the Queen's name, her madge doesn't need one to travel herself. "As a British passport is issued in the name of Her Majesty, it is unnecessary for The Queen to possess one," according to royal.gov.uk. "All other members of the Royal Family, including The Duke of Edinburgh and The Prince of Wales, have passports."2. She knows how to fire a gunThe Queen means business in this photo. Image: Rex USAThis photo (which is arguably the best picture taken of anyone, ever) was snapped during a royal visit to Surrey's National Shooting Centre. The Queen couldn't resist some target practice when she was shown this L85 battle rifle.Image: Wikimedia CommonsThe Queen is the only living head of state in the world to have served during World War II and she was the only female member of the British royal family to do so. She joined the Women's Auxiliary Territorial Service when she was 18 and learned how to drive a military truck, during which time she also acquired some serious engine-fixing skills (which leads us nicely on to our next fact).4. She's a trained mechanicThe Queen – or the Princess, as she was then – didn't just drive trucks during WWII; she also learned how to repair them. "When the training centre was visited by the King and Queen and Princess Margaret, they found Princess Elizabeth in overalls, working on the engine of a Red Cross lorry," says the narrator in the video. "Princess Elizabeth, honorary second subaltern, ATS, is now a competent mechanic, and proud of the fact."5. She has two birthdaysThe Trooping the Colour parade, June 2015.The Queen doesn't just celebrate one birthday a year like regular folk, oh no; as well as probably getting better presents than you (she got her first corgi, Susan, for her 18th), she also gets twice as many birthdays. She was actually born on April 21, but her "official" birthday is held in early June on a Saturday, during which she hits the town for the Trooping the Colour parade.6. She was sending emails before the internet was even a thingThe Queen is always up-to-date with the latest tech trends.Think you're good at technology? You ain't got nothing on Liz. She may have only just got in on the Twitter game last year, but the Queen sent her first email from an Army base back in 1976 (becoming the first Monarch to do so).7. She owns a ton of the most badass birds around"Bring me my swan."A lot of people think the Queen owns all the swans in Britain, but this isn't technically true. According to the official website of the British Monarchy, "the Crown retains the right to ownership of all unmarked mute swans in open water, but The Queen only exercises her ownership on certain stretches of the Thames and its surrounding tributaries". She still owns more swans than the average person, though, and every year the Swan Upping ceremony (aka the annual Thames swan census) provides an opportunity for her to take to the waters and count her glistening, feathery flock first-hand.8. She's not averse to the occasional photobombDuring the Commonwealth Games in 2014, Australian hockey player Jayde Taylor tweeted one of the most epic selfies of all time, which featured a grinning and slightly blurred Queen Elizabeth in the background, peering into the lens.9. She's starred alongside James BondShe can fix an engine in the blink of an eye, she can fire a gun, she knows how to handle intruders AND she's pals with James Bond – as the evident suggests, the queen is basically a secret agent. The clip above was filmed as part of the opening ceremony for the London 2012 Olympic Games, which saw Daniel Craig escorting Her Majesty out of Buckingham Palace and into a helicopter, before the pair made a grand entrance by skydiving into the Olympic Stadium (the Queen may have used a stunt double for that last bit, but given her proven track record in badassery it's impossible to be sure).10. Celebrities queue up to hang out with herModels, actors, Hollywood A-listers, and even members of One Direction – the Queen has met them all. And they always come to her.11. She's been known to enjoy Ali G impressionsImage: giphy.comOr, more specifically, Ali G impressions given by her mother. Yep that's right, the Queen Mum was an Ali G fan – a fact confirmed by Prince William and Prince Harry in an interview in which they described a Christmas around the turn of the Millenium when the Queen Mother came across them watching Ali G on TV, and they showed her how to click her fingers and say 'Respec'."It was at the end of the meal, and she stood up and said: 'Darling, lunch was marvellous – respec,' and clicked her fingers," said Prince Harry, before William went on to describe how the whole family burst out laughing – including the Queen, who the impression had been directed at.Clearly being a badass is something that runs in the family.Have something to add to this story?

Where did Jess and Ben Seewald go on their honeymoon? Duggar Family Blog View all 5 photosJessa Duggar and her husband, Ben Seewald's first honeymoon picture was released by the Duggar family this weekend, with many fans wondering where Mr. and Mrs. Seewald went on their post-wedding vacation.Duggar Family BlogThe photo of the happy couple kissing isn't as steamy as the first photo they released of themselves sharing an intimate moment, with Ben giving his new wife a kiss on the cheek instead. The pic was posted on the Duggar family's blog with a caption that asks fans to guess where the couple's secret honeymoon location was."Jessa (Duggar) and Ben Seewald are celebrating one week of marriage as they honeymoon in an undisclosed location. Where do you think the newlyweds are in this picture?"Jessa and Ben are both wearing jackets in the photo, so it's obvious that they didn't go on a tropical vacation — or the beach was very cold. The newlyweds are pictured in front of a stone building with trees in the background.Jessa Duggar's wedding pics revealed, pregnancy announcement photo next?Were they in New England to see the fall foliage or did they head overseas for their honeymoon? Fans made their best guesses in the comments under the photo."Back in Eureka Springs, since it has been one week.......The stones in the building look like Eureka." "Ozark Mountains" "Somewhere chilly I'd guess since they're wearing lighter jackets. Along the East Coast maybe? The Carolinas...?" "By the look of their attire, i would say East of Arkansas, or Europe somewhere." "Maybe they went up north like Boston or Maine? It looks chilly where they are!"Wherever Jessa (Duggar) Seewald and her husband, Ben are, it's likely they are enjoying a little time out of the spotlight. TLC's cameras were rolling at their November 1 wedding with the wedding to be shown on the next season of "19 Kids and Counting."A sex scandal ensued shortly after, with ridiculous rumors surfacing online that the couple consummated their marriage shortly after their ceremony in the back room of the church they married in. Coupled with the rather racy first photo the couple shared on Instagram, a honeymoon away from the public eye is probably just what these newlyweds needed.Where do you think Jessa and Ben Seewald went on their honeymoon?
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/11/20/scuttle-it-bill-cosby-demands-reporter-rape-allegations-disappear/20996666/	Scuttle it': Bill Cosby demands a reporter make awkward on-camera exchange over rape allegations disappear	Shocking new video from the Associated Press shows beleaguered comedian Bill Cosby stammer and stutter over questions about rape allegations before arrogantly demanding the reporter not make public the footage.Cosby's refusal to respond to the questions came along with an apparent threat to the AP reporter's integrity. The exchange happened Nov 6 during an interview about an art exhibit as his mortified wife sat next to him.The interview appears to have gone well, as both the Cosbys were shown laughing, until the reporter insisted he had to ask about the avalanche of claims bringing Cosby's legacy crashing to the ground.The legendary comedian's demeanor quickly turned sour as he tried to brush aside the question."No, no, we don't answer that," said Cosby, dismissively shaking his head."I just wanted to ask if you wanted to respond to that, whether any of that was true," said the unnamed reporter."There's no response," said a defeated sounding Cosby, again shaking his head.The reporter further pressed, asking if people should view Cosby differently."There is no comment about that," he said. "And I'll tell you why, I think you were told I don't want to compromise your integrity, but, um, we don't, I don't, talk about it."The interview neared its end and both the comedian and his wife flashed strained, forced smiles as Cosby then made a desperate, pathetic plea to the reporter."Can I get something from you?" He asked. "That none of that will be shown."The reporter insists he can make no promises, and then reminds Cosby he did not say anything before the fallen star ends with a rambling, almost incoherent reply."I know I didn't say anything, but, I'm asking your integrity that, since I didn't want to say anything, but I did answer you, in terms of, I don't want to say anything, of what value will it have?"Both the reporter and another woman reply that it does not have much value, after Cosby awkwardly forced a reply out of an off-camera producer."And I would appreciate it if it was scuttled," said the accused rapist. "I think, if you want to consider yourself to be serious, that it will not appear anywhere."Despite the cameras still rolling and Cosby still wearing a microphone, his ranting continued."We thought, by the way, because it was AP, that it wouldn't be necessary to go over that question with you," said Cosby."If you will just tell your boss the reason why we didn't say that up front is because we thought that AP had the integrity to not ask."A total of 14 women, including supermodel Janice Dickinson, now 59, have accused Cosby of sexual assault and/or rape.The allegations had dissipated into the ether until comedian Hannibal Buress brought them back into the public consciousness during an October set at a Philadelphia comedy club.The resulting fallout led Netflix to postpone a standup special featuring Cosby that was scheduled to air on Black Friday.The NBC network also canceled a previously-announced family sitcom starring Cosby that was scheduled to hit the airwaves next summer or fall.The TV Land cable network has even pulled reruns of the iconic "Cosby Show" from the airwaves until further notice.All Cosby has left is a scheduled nationwide comedy tour, will it be his last stand or will this newly-revealed exchange be the last nail in the coffin of his once-vaunted career?
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/10/11/police-shooting-protests-expand-across-st-louis/20976436/	Thousands in St. Louis to protest police shootings	ST. LOUIS (AP) - Thousands gathered Saturday for a second day of organized rallies and marches protesting Michael Brown's death and other fatal police shootings in the St. Louis area and elsewhere.Marchers started assembling in the morning hours in downtown St. Louis, where later in the day the Cardinals were set to host the San Francisco Giants in the first game of the National League Championship Series.Spurred by a national campaign dubbed Ferguson October, a diverse crowd joined forces. Vietnam-era peace activists, New York City seminarians and hundreds of fast-food workers bused in from Chicago, Nashville and other cities marched alongside local residents.Four days of events are planned. They started Friday afternoon with a march outside the St. Louis County prosecutor's office in Clayton. Protesters renewed calls for prosecutor Bob McCulloch to charge Darren Wilson, a white Ferguson officer, in the Aug. 9 death of Brown, a black, unarmed 18-year-old. A grand jury is reviewing the case and the Justice Department has opened a civil rights investigation."We still are knee deep in this situation," said Kareem Jackson, a St. Louis rap artist and community organizer whose stage name is Tef Poe. "We have not packed up our bags, we have not gone home. This is not a fly-by-night moment. This is not a made-for-TV revolution. This is real people standing up to a real problem and saying, 'We ain't taking it no more.'"The downtown march came hours before the Cardinals game at Busch Stadium, just blocks from the protest route. St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson said the city had enlisted extra officers and was prepared for trouble, though he hoped for the best.Earlier in the week, a small group of protesters verbally clashed with Cardinals fans who support the Ferguson officer outside the stadium."What I ask is if people come to have their message heard, that they do it in a respectful way," Dotson said. "And the same thing on the other side (from police supporters). Everybody has a right to have their message heard, whether you like it or not."He said the city also will bolster its police presence when the St. Louis Rams host the San Francisco 49ers in a nationally televised game Monday night - the same day protesters are planning organized acts of civil disobedience.The crowd Saturday was significantly larger than the ones seen at Friday's protests in Ferguson and Clayton. While the main focus of the march was on recent police shootings, participants also embraced such causes as gay rights and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Police reported no arrests or violence Saturday afternoon."I have two sons and a daughter. I want a world for them where the people who are supposed to be community helpers are actually helping, where they can trust those people to protect and serve rather than control and repress," said Ashlee Wiest-Laird, 48, a Baptist pastor from Boston.The situation in Missouri especially resonated with Wiest-Laird. She's white and her adopted sons, ages 14 and 11, are black."What I see happening here is a moment in time. There's something bigger here," she said.Organizers said beforehand that they expected as many as 6,000 to 10,000 participants for the weekend's events. Police were not able to provide a crowd estimate Saturday, but organizers and participants suggested the march's size may have approached as many as 3,000.Since Brown's death, three other fatal police shootings of black males have occurred in the St. Louis area. The most recent happened Wednesday night on St. Louis' south side when police say an off-duty city officer working for a private neighborhood security patrol shot and killed 18-year-old Vonderrit D. Myers.The white officer, whose name hasn't been released, fired 17 rounds after police say Myers opened fire. Myers' parents say he was unarmed.
http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/todays-secret-viral-marketing-one-clever-real-world-idea-166377	Today's Secret to Viral Marketing? One Clever Real-World Idea	Regional outdoor ads can get brands big buzz online.Want to create the next viral marketing smash online? Start by thinking outdoors and small. Over the past few years, some of the most interesting—and nationally recognized—marketing campaigns that swept across the Internet began with inexpensive, local media buys or stunts. If such a campaign takes off on social media, that modest investment gets your brand or cause in front of millions of eyeballs."What a few people experience live can be shared with millions when the outdoor idea works as an eye-opening or simply entertaining stunt," said Per Pedersen, Grey's deputy worldwide chief creative officer. "That turns outdoor into something much bigger than a localized installation. It's the centerpiece of branded content and viral advertising—but only if the storytelling is great."With real-world ideas translating into viral hits almost weekly, we asked agency and branding experts for their tips on creating an out-of-home campaign that extends far beyond its starting point.1. Latch on to pop culture in surprising waysReal-time marketing isn't just for Twitter. Some of the most interesting outdoor campaigns are pegged to pop culture.When PR firm Taylor Herring wanted to promote British broadcaster UKTV in 2013, it made a literal splash by installing a sculpture of Colin Firth in a lake. The scene was based on the actor's portrayal of Mr. Darcy in Pride and Prejudice, a role locals likely remembered well.Later that year, Taylor Herring set up a massive dragon skull on England's Charmouth Beach—famous for its dinosaur fossils—to plug HBO's Game of Thrones."If it's something the media are already talking about, you can join the conversation, which is often easier than starting one," explained James Herring, managing partner at Taylor Herring.2. Get out of the major citiesThe other common denominator of Herring's strange campaigns is that they're both in small cities, giving them a curiosity factor.Marketers typically turn to New York, Chicago and Los Angeles to get billboards in front of as many people as possible, but in the age of social media, small-scale installations can be just as effective."Force yourself to look beyond those clichéd locations," Herring said. "Every city has three famous backdrops that are overused in campaigns. Creatives use these out of paranoia that their [idea] won't work without that all-too familiar skyline in the backdrop. It's not true."3. Don't be afraid to dupe peopleThe whole point of digitally geared outdoor campaigns is to get people talking, which sometimes means setting up hidden cameras that can be turned into social and video content later."If the OOH [ad] is capable of allowing the users to interact with it, then it makes for a great hidden-camera type of video or content that allows the brand to scale it with PR and paid social media amplification," said Eric Williamson, svp and director of digital and content strategy at Mullen Lowe.Linking up digital video with live stunts is a tactic the agency has used for clients like JetBlue.In the example below, JetBlue's "Better Wingman" stunt created an interactive display that was secretly customized to each user:4. Keep it simpleSometimes a great one-liner is enough for an ad to take off online. Mendi Robinson, creative director at Lamar Advertising Company, pointed to its recent project with nonprofit 14x48 and Brooklyn-based artist Julia Weist as an example of how local outdoor campaigns spark national attention.Weist claims to be the only artist to use the word "parbunkells" online. The term stems from the 17th century and means "coming together through the binding of two ropes."Robinson said that the effort "proved that even the smallest out-of-home campaign can spark interest and engagement, leading to an enormous amount of online and social chatter."5. Riskier brands are betterOutdoor campaigns are great at building one-off buzz, but there's also a risk that marketers won't be able to capture lightning in a bottle twice. With that in mind, it takes a risky brand to play in extreme, local advertising, said Sam Ewen, partner at experimental agency Guild.The payoff can be big, though. When TBWA\Media Art Lab and Apple decided to run smartphone-shot photos on billboards this year, some may have questioned the idea of slapping user-generated content on an outdoor ad. But the clever use of photography scored the team a Cannes Grand Prix win this year."Ideas can be replicated, but it has to be the right idea," Ewen said. "Most brands [don't have] iconic props nor a rabid fandom."

http://www.aol.com/article/2014/08/25/tiny-houses-could-solve-homeless-problem/20952108/	Tiny houses could solve homeless problem	It appears as if tiny homes could be the solution to a very big problem.Portland Mayor Charlie Hales is preparing to endorse the construction of a number of 192 square foot houses on publicly owned land to help curb the homeless population in the city. The homes, designed by TECHDWELL, would cost between $250 to $350 per month for individuals, with laundry and other amenities on site. Residents making between $5,000 to $15,000 per month could easily afford to rent them.A Multnomah County chairwoman told Oregon Live, "Before people can get back on their feet and take advantage of job training and drug and alcohol counseling, they need a place to live. This helps accomplish that."The project is a big step from the mayor who was criticized back in February for attempting to clear out homeless campsites. In fact a crowd of portland residents protested the crackdown with lit torches.Mayor Hales is said to be "infatuated" with this idea.Tiny home communities have been successful in states like New York, Texas, and Wisconsin, and have improved the lives of countless homeless residents.The city's mayor hopes the first micro community will be in place by next February.

http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2014/11/12/aaron-rodgers-learns-the-downside-of-a-short-nights-work/?ocid=Yahoo&partner=ya5nbcs	Aaron Rodgers learns the downside of a short night’s work	APPackers quarterback Aaron Rodgers only played two series into the second half against the Bears last Sunday night as the Packers turned to Matt Flynn after taking a 45-0 lead.Rodgers threw six touchdown passes in the first half of the game and admitted Tuesday that he would have liked to tie the NFL record for touchdown passes in a game by tossing a seventh in the second half and said that he thinks you owe it to the game to keep playing, although he allowed that “there’s a time and a place” for such efforts and that the same respect for the game sometimes calls for a different approach.Missing out on a chance at touchdown No. 7 wasn’t the only downside of the trip to the bench for Rodgers. While he generally felt well on Monday after the limited night’s work, one part of his body was worse for the lack of wear.“My low back was actually hurting,” Rodgers said on ESPN Milwaukee, via the Green Bay Press-Gazette. “I think it attribute that to standing around the entire time in the second half. The guys took really good care of me on the field. I barely got touched all game, but my back actually got a little tight on the sideline. I forgot what a strain that can be to stand there and watch. It’s more fun, obviously, to be out there and play.”There’s no suggestion that the lower back tightness will be any more of a hindrance than Rodgers’s recent hamstring tweak, which means that the quarterback should be able to keep up his torrid recent pace.

http://www.examiner.com/article/raiders-bring-salt-the-wounds-to-49ers-rough-season	Raiders bring salt in the wounds to 49ers rough season	The Raiders put a sting on the 49ers with a winThe San Francisco 49ers are 7-6, but it can look like a losing record after today's 24-13 loss after falling to the 2-11 Oakland Raiders. They had the league's worst record in the NFL leading up to this game.Colin Kaepernick's first play from scrimmage was a sign of desperation. He tried to improvise dialing a deep route, but the ball floated up for an interception to Brandian Ross. Suddenly, the offense had almost no signs of life.While there was one touchdown drive to Bruce Miller, the game was poor from start to finish. Kaepernick couldn't hit his targets, the offensive line couldn't block for them and the 49ers abandoned the run when it was working.Meanwhile, the defense finally had a poor game on their side of the ball. Derek Carr had plenty of time for pass protection, leading to open receivers and tight ends left and right. If it weren't for some silly penalties by Oakland, this was a blowout.Mychal Rivera found the gaps in the 49ers defense, who has overachieved this year with the losses of Patrick Willis and NaVorro Bowman. Chris Borland and Michael Wilhoite had trouble dropping into coverage, but the zone defense left space open for the second year tight end.On the flip side, Kaepernick was lacking protection and couldn't read blitzes. There were even coverage sacks, where he couldn't escape the pocket and throw the ball away.Today, the world saw a Raiders team who was motivated, not thinking about their 52-0 debacle in St. Louis as they came to play. The 49ers have major soul searching to do, with a sign of no urgency, lack of offense and now even a defense that let Carr throw all over them.Offensively, the 49ers were offensive and most of this will fall on Kaepernick and the coaching staff. There are offensive line struggles, but Kaepernick failed to do anything when given an opportunity.The 49ers season is not officially over yet, but with a game in Seattle next week, their season is no longer in their own hands. They trail the Seattle Seahawks, Detroit Lions and Dallas Cowboys by two games and all three teams won this week.Locally, this is all about bragging rights, as the team from the East Bay can gloat about this. The Oakland Raiders were playing with a lame duck coach of Tony Sparano, rookie quarterback, third string safety and still were the better team through 60 minutes.Even Carr looks like the more promising quarterback in the Bay Area after the way Kaepernick's 2014 season has gone. He's 27, and saying he's young cannot be an excuse no longer. Suddenly, there could be a different team on the rise and it's possible that Harbaugh's time in San Francisco is coming to an end soon.San Francisco loses a game where the opposition has less talent and less resources as they don't have excuses. Embarrassment is an understatement to this game.

http://nationalinterest.org/feature/russias-massive-military-modernization-might-be-big-trouble-11768	Russia's Massive Military Modernization Might Be in Big Trouble	Most of the attention on Russia's ambitious plans to overhaul its armed forces has focused on questions of procurement—what new systems and capabilities the military has on its wish list. Russian president Vladimir Putin recently reaffirmed his commitment to the ambitious modernization program that he has put into place since returning to the presidency in 2012. However, the expected slowdown of the Russian economy (partly due to Western sanctions, partly due to a nearly 30 percent decline in the price of oil since the summer) will force the Kremlin to spend its defense rubles more wisely. Throwing large volumes of cash at the problem is no longer an option. Equipment certainly is important, but an examination of the specific trees—whether a fifth-generation fighter will be in service, a new class of nuclear ballistic missiles deployed, or focusing on the specifications of a next generation of armored vehicles, and so on—can miss the larger forest, principally the question as to whether Russia can in fact sustain the burdens of a twenty-first-century defense establishment.(You May Also Like: The Russian Air Force's Secret Weapon) President Vladimir Putin, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov and the deputy prime minister in charge of the military-industrial complex, Dmitry Rogozin, will have to wrestle with this question. Here are the three main challenges they will have to face.France's decision to suspend delivery of the Mistral helicopter carriers highlights the first challenge: preventing Russia's isolation from global markets, especially in terms of buying capabilities and platforms that Russia cannot currently source from domestic industries. Defense cooperation with Italian and German firms is also imperiled as calls for NATO members to restrict their defense cooperation with Moscow take root. Moreover, even with the events of the past year, the Russian military continues to depend on components produced by Ukrainian firms to equip itself. Although a Ukrainian government decree banning sales of military equipment for use in the Russian Armed Forces has been haphazardly enforced—with reports that some companies have sought to flout the rules by exporting to middleman firms who then resell items for Russian military use or by taking advantage of the legal loophole of selling components to Belarus—Ukraine is not likely to be a stable source of supply in the future. In a number of hi-tech areas, notably unmanned systems and electronic suites for effective command and control, Russia has turned to partners like Israel who are global leaders in this area. Yet Israeli sources have acknowledged that, under pressure from the United States, Israel has foregone additional contracts by limiting what it is prepared to sell to the Russian military. Even India—Russia's long-time defense partner, where joint collaboration has led to impressive results like the supersonic BrahMos cruise missile—is now considering whether it might be more advantageous to forge closer links with the U.S. defense industry. Other rising powers—Brazil and South Africa among them—may be interested in closer ties with the Russian defense complex. But while these countries may be able to help finance major, new arms deals, they are not particularly in a strong position to supply advanced components as part of any joint development project.(You May Like: 5 Russian Weapons of War NATO Should Fear) Recognizing this problem, Rogozin has been consistently calling for Russia to strengthen its domestic capabilities and to diminish its dependence on international sources of supply, particularly for high-technology components (a call that has been mirrored by the energy industry, which sees ambitious plans for developing the Russian Arctic and nontraditional sources of hydrocarbons imperiled by sanctions prohibiting Western firms from transferring the needed technology for use in the Russian market). In his opinion, Russia's reserves, built up from the export of energy, should be used to jump-start the reindustrialization of Russia. The challenge here, however, is whether the Kremlin is capable of acting as an effective angel investor, rather than simply funneling large amounts of money that will end up wasted or diverted.Pages

Text messages, emails and online credit card statements leave the careless cheater with an electronic affair trail a gigabyte long. We know the typical telltale signs: weight loss, new music or food interests, the purchase of a new wardrobe. But if your affair radar is up -- because your partner's behavior just feels off or out of the ordinary -- here are 13 not-as-conspicuous signs you may be overlooking.1) Time-stamping: Optimizing precious moments with a lover is a balancing act, so he's counting minutes. "It won't raise any red flags if I'm home by 6:00 p.m. on the dot," he rationalizes. Or, "If I call her every day at noon, she won't get suspicious." He's drawing timelines in the sand -- and being uncharacteristically prompt or oddly ritualized with his schedule may be one way he does that.2) New lingo: A friend of mine's suspicions grew when he heard his wife irritably yell, "Good Christ!" -- an expression neither one of them had ever used -- and one she typically would find offensive. If she's spending enough time with her lover, she's sure to pick up some of his/her expressions.3) Changing things up: Every evening -- like clockwork -- he comes home, asks about dinner and walks the dog. Now, that ritual is being messed with. He needs a shower as soon as he walks in the door. Or he pours himself two fingers of scotch when that's usually reserved for weekends only.4) Driving alone: Typically, you'd hop in the car together and be on your way. But recently she finds a myriad of reasons to have a few minutes alone -- and a need to take her own car. "I have to stop at Sephora, and I don't want to bore you!" she says. Time and again.5) Wearing a lampshade: "Let's go out and get sh*t-faced tonight," he atypically and enthusiastically suggests. And you know he hasn't said anything like that since he was pledging a fraternity. Having an affair -- it's no secret -- can make people feel young and impulsive again and that can spill over into other behaviors.6) Wanting you to strut your stuff: What's this? A little something from Vicky's Secret just for you? Funny, he's always claimed that lingerie doesn't do much for him. His affair has reawakened his libido and, ironically, he'd like it to do the same for you.7) You're clearly up to no good: You smile at the waiter, and he goes off. He knows you're a friendly sort -- didn't he always love that about you? -- but recently that innocent cordiality seems to antagonize him in ways it never did. Now that he's having an affair, he knows it's not so far-fetched that you might, too.8) No harm in looking, right?: "Did you see our cute neighbor checking out your butt?" she asks with a big smile. "That flight attendant is really your type!" she teases, leaving you wondering what happened to her jealous streak. No mystery. She's on an affair-fueled, guilt-mitigating mission to casually justify extramarital attractions.9) Affairs? No biggie: You sadly report your best friend's husband is cheating. Instead of sharing your dismay, he becomes defensive. "Well, he hasn't been happy in that marriage," or "People have affairs. That's life." Condemning others means condemning himself -- and he's not about to go there.10) Won't watch it: Fatal Attraction? Derailed? The Affair? Forget it. Plot lines that would have formerly piqued her interest now make her visibly uncomfortable. If there's an affair involved, know you won't be seeing it together.11) All nerves: Many folks experience atypical bouts of depression and anxiety as the guilt of the affair -- and the stress of keeping such a huge secret -- take a visible toll. Symptoms may include insomnia, disinterest in eating or an unshakeable blue mood.12) Suddenly an expert: "Did you know the U.S. has the highest dog population in the world?" She starts spewing facts about things she's never shown interest in before. Heck, she never even liked dogs that much. Could be she's absorbing her lover's interests -- and finding a way to talk about him/her without saying as much.13) Signature blank stare: The guy who always has an answer now seems lost for words. His brain is fried with the details of the lies he's told and excuses he's made. When you innocently inquire about his last trip to Home Depot, you can almost see the wheels turning in his head: Did I tell her I went to Home Depot? What did I tell her I was shopping for? Is she trying to trap me in a lie? While he entertains these possibilities, you're on the receiving end of that strange, faraway look in his eyes you've been seeing all too often.

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/back-2000-cia-made-predictions-190900237.html	Back In 2000, The CIA Made These Predictions For 2015	REUTERS/STR New The CIA's 2000 report guided George W. Bush. Back in 2000, the CIA published a 70-page report on what the world would be like in 2015. Here were some of those predictions, according to a December 2000 story from The Telegraph."International affairs are increasingly determined by large and powerful organizations rather than governments." Verdict: Probably true, though it is sometimes hard to distinguish between non-state actors and state actors. Just look at the Islamic State or the possibly-not-North Korean hackers who took down Sony."Between now and 2015 terrorist tactics will become increasingly sophisticated and designed to achieve mass casualties." Verdict: Definitely true. Sadly, this prediction became true within months."Iraq and Iran [will] develop long range missiles in the near future. Iran … could be testing such weapons by as early as the coming year, and cruise missiles by 2004." Verdict: Both true and false. Iran is definitely working on an ICBM, but it won't test it till next year."The world population will grow by more than one billion, to 7.2 billion." Verdict: True."Energy resources will be sufficient to meet demand." Verdict: Nailed it. Companies are actually canceling plans to dig up more natural gas because oil is abundant right now."China's economy will grow to overtake Europe as the world's second largest but still behind the United States." Verdict: True-ish. By some measurements, China's economy is now larger than the US economy."Europe will not achieve fully the dreams of parity with the US as a shaper of the global economic system." Verdict: Correct. The report was way too bullish on the European economy, which is "going nowhere" these days."Aids, famine, and continuing economic and political turmoil means that populations in many [African] countries will actually fall." Verdict: False. Africa's population rose from 800 million in 2000 to 1.1 billion in 2014.NOW WATCH: This Animated Map Shows How European Languages EvolvedMore From Business InsiderThe Apple Watch Is Going To Be A Flop, Top Startup Investor Says Facebook, Apple, And Microsoft Are Ganging Up On Google — And It Couldn't Happen At A Worse Time Google Is Going Through A Rough Transition — And There's Some Pessimism Around The Company
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mw-jacobs/crank-economics-crank-science_b_7983044.html	'Crank Economics, Crank Science, Crank Foreign Policy'	It took a while but finally someone in the media voiced what most people who aren't Republican partisans have known for a long time. The day after the first Republican debate, Nobel Prize-winning economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman wrote: "One of our two major parties has gone off the deep end. Or as the political analysts Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein put it in their book 'It's Even Worse Than It Looks,' the G.O.P. has become an 'insurgent outlier ... unpersuaded by conventional understanding of facts, evidence, and science.' "This might be stating the too-obvious-to-bother if it was just the Tea Party loonies, but it's not.Krugman went on, "While media puff pieces have portrayed Mr. Trump's rivals as serious men... their supposed seriousness is all surface. Judge them by positions as opposed to image, and what you have is a lineup of cranks... Crank economics, crank science, crank foreign policy are all necessary parts of a candidate's resume... Talking nonsense is what you have to do to get anywhere in today's Republican Party... Leading Republicans have generally tried to preserve a facade of respectability, helping the news media to maintain the pretense that it was dealing with a normal political party." No one so prominent as Krugman has put it so bluntly before. Certainly not the pundits whose jobs require that they "maintain the pretense" nor the Democratic politicians who must sit across the negotiating table from these "cranks."There is not a single policy issue where the Republicans have science and/or the consensus of scientific experts on their side. Not one.My point here is not simply to pass on these insights but to ask the logical question: where do we go after this realization? How do we proceed now that the opposition has ceased to be "rational players" (an old phrase from the Cold War that has found new usefulness)? A "rational player" in this context could be defined as someone capable of changing an opinion when it is contradicted by new facts. Who seriously believes that any Republican, or member of the Tea Party that now controls the Republican Party, is capable of this?The Republicans were apparently traumatized by the catastrophic failure of the Bush administration, possibly the worst administration in the history of the republic, with its legacy of a pointless war and economic collapse. But rather than rethink their policy positions and change accordingly, the GOP has hunkered down and now operates with the psychological dynamics of a cult, a besieged sect huddled around unquestioned truths.Our system is predicated on rational dialogue between the two major political parties, but right now only one is capable of rational dialogue. What is accomplished by continuing the pretense and expecting reason from the Republicans? I don't know what to do in terms of political strategy but let the colloquy begin and let's come up with something.However, I do have an idea for how to proceed in interpersonal relations: refuse to engage. There is a precedent for dealing with this kind of irrationality in public discourse in the example of the Holocaust denier. If Republican positions don't have the visceral repugnance of the Holocaust denier, they are nevertheless every bit as divorced from reality. Civil society seems to have arrived at a consensus intuitively on how to deal with the Holocaust denier, which is: refuse to engage. If you engage him in serious debate, the Holocaust denier has already won. He knows he can't convince anyone, he just wants his position to be taken seriously enough to deserve a refutation, to be included in the list of possible positions. You can observe the same behavior in a Republican politician or spokesperson on TV discussing climate change. They don't expect to change any minds or win debates, they just want to keep their position legitimate. Let's delegitimize them by refusing to "maintain the pretense."I'm not advocating an end to political discourse but a recognition that it has already ended and that we need to come up with a political strategy for dealing with the irrationality that confronts us and stop coasting on our old habits.
http://www.cosmopolitan.co.uk/reports/news/a29984/kate-middleton-nope-no-thanks/	In truly shocking news, no one wants to be Kate Middleton	Getty Share Tweet PinToday in absolutely baffling news, hardly anyone wants to be Kate Middleton. Which is just bloody outrageous.In a survey commissioned by Newsweek Europe and published by YouGov, it was revealed that only 1% of the British population would like to be Kate Middleton. Fair enough, in a way, if you're being very practical and responsible. The majority of us probably wouldn't want that kind of fame and attention, or to feel the massive pressure of being the face of a nation.What's not fair enough, though, is that 89% of us wouldn't even want to be Kate Middleton for ONE DAY. WHAT. How bloody rude. Have you not seen her magical hair? Have you never wondered what it would be like to be an actual princess, rather than just prancing about the house singing 'Let It Go'? Haven't you seen the Queen's corgis, who you would probably be allowed to play with all the time? Seriously, 89% of the population, you are a bunch of fools.It gets worse. Even harsher is that only 32% of people said they would want to be friends with Kate (what is wrong with you people. She is lovely), and 15% of people flat out said "I would never want to be or know Kate." Also, weirdly, only 6% of men said they wish they were married to Kate Middleton, which essentially indicates that the majority of men are absolute tools. She is a flawless royal unicorn with excellent outfits.43% of people did concede, however, that Kate does represent a step forward for women and reflects 'modern women', and 65% agreed that she is a very or fairly positive role model for young girls. Which is nice.Sadly, however, only 3% believe she is a feminist (she's never commented on her personal stance), and the majority of people believe that she has not got control and ownership over her own body. Also, only 21% of people believe she has a lot of influence over her own life, and a mere 9% said she has control over what she says in public. Depressing.
http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ebola-outbreak-family-of-first-u-s-ebola-victim-and-hospital-reach-resolution/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17	Ebola outbreak: Family of first U.S. Ebola victim and hospital reach "resolution"	DALLAS -- Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas has reached an agreement with the family of Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan, who died in October at the medical facility, CBS Dallas reports.Play Video CBS Evening News U.S. Ebola death exposes flaws in healthcare system The death of Thomas Eric Duncan sheds light on serious flaws in the U.S. healthcare system. Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital released him when ...The agreement comes after allegations of wrong-doing, protocols not being followed, and claims that the hospital did not do enough to protect the patient. It has been just over one month since the 42-year-old man from Africa lost his fight with Ebola.Duncan's sister and nephew were present as the family's attorney announced a multi-faceted agreement, which included a financial settlement and a charitable contribution."This has been a tragic loss for the children and the parents," said attorney Les Weisbrod. "We're here today to announce a settlement that will take care of all the children and parents."Weisbrod said the family's mission was to "raise awareness of preventable medical errors in the U.S." According to Weisbrod, there are approximately 400,000 preventable deaths in the U.S. each year.The financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed, but Weisbrod says the deal is better than what could have been won by the family had the two sides gone to trial.The hospital will also setup a charitable fund in memory of Duncan that will provide assistance to victims of Ebola in Africa.The Duncan family also has expressed interest in a book or movie to highlight Duncan's life and tragic demise.Duncan first arrived at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on September 25, complaining of Ebola symptoms. But he was sent away after a triage nurse did not effectively communicate his travel history. Duncan returned to the hospital's emergency room two days later, this time showing more serious symptoms. It was only then that he was considered to be a possible Ebola patient.The hospital has already apologized to Duncan's family for the mistakes that were made, including the initial misdiagnosis.
http://news.yahoo.com/factbox-u-navy-warship-readies-16-month-deployment-042831299--finance.html	Factbox: New U.S. Navy warship readies for 16-month deployment to Asia	(Reuters) - The USS Fort Worth, a warship built by Lockheed Martin Corp, is slated to depart on Monday for Asia, where it will operate largely out of Singapore for 16 months, the longest deployment of a U.S. Navy ship in 42 years, Navy officials said.Following are some key facts about the ship, which was commissioned in September 2012 and the crew:Third Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) built for the NavySecond in the Freedom class of ships, which is based on a steel monohull design.Ship will arrive in Singapore by the end of the year for its first deployment. The first LCS ship, the USS Freedom, was deployed for 10 months in Singapore last year.The Fort Worth has a core crew of 54 people, plus 19 to operate a package of surface-warfare equipment. Twenty-four others serve in the aviation unit that operates a manned MH-60R Seahawk helicopter built by Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp, and an unmanned, autonomous MQ-8B Fire Scout helicopter built by Northrop Grumman Corp.First time that a Seahawk and a Fire Scout will be deployed together aboard a Littoral Combat Ship. The unmanned helicopter has a range of about 100 miles (161 km), extending the ship's ability to monitor its surroundings.A new crew will relieve the first one after four months, with a total of four crews to serve during the 16 months.Navy officials said this would be the longest deployment of a U.S. Navy ship since the carrier Midway was under way for 327 days in 1973 with the same crew.Fort Worth is 390 feet (119 meters) long and has a draft of 13 feet (4 meters), which means it can enter many more coastal areas than the Navy's destroyers, which have a draft of over 30 feet.It is 15 percent more fuel efficient than the USS Freedom, and slightly faster. It can achieve speeds of over 40 knots (74 km per hour).LCS ships were designed to carry out a range of missions, including hunting for mines, submarines and surface warfare, using equipment packages that can be easily swapped out.(Reporting by Andrea Shalal in San Diego, California; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)
http://time.com/3982291/unreal-and-the-evolution-of-the-female-anti-hero/	UnREAL and the Arrival of the Totally Dark, Utterly Irresistible Female Anti-Hero	James Dittiger—Lifetime Constance Zimmer and Shiri Appleby in UnREALThe creators and stars of the drama that goes behind-the-scenes on a reality dating show talk why audiences are finally ready for unlikable ladiesThe first time we see Rachel, the protagonist of Lifetime’s new show UnREAL, she is lying on the floor of a limousine nestled among the stilettos of group of women about to compete for a man’s heart on a Bachelor-like reality dating show called Everlasting. She is wearing a “this is what a feminist looks like” t-shirt. Within minutes of that shot Rachel, a producer on Everlasting, is plying these women with alcohol and preying on their insecurities in order to elicit the sort of breakdown that qualifies as “must see TV.”If she manages to coax tears or screams out of the ladies, she earns a cash bonus from her boss, Quinn, who is busy in the control room labeling the show’s contestants “wifey” or “slut.” By Monday’s finale of UnREAL’s first season, the two producers will be at least in part responsible for several public humiliations, a sexual assault and even a death.The show has broken ground by simultaneously skewering a genre that pits women against women and upending the prince myth with a selfish dolt. But perhaps most revolutionary of all, it offers a manipulative female lead who’s not just a villainous foil, but the central protagonist. Rachel is not a victim turned bad. She’s just a woman who is frighteningly good at her exploitative job.“There are other examples of female anti-heroes on TV,” says the show’s co-creator, Marti Noxon, whose long resume as a producer includes Buffy, Mad Men and Grey’s Anatomy. “But we wanted to push it to the limits and say, ‘That’s not despicable enough.’”Rachel and Quinn’s predecessors—Nancy Botwin from Weeds, Ellen Parsons from Damages and Piper Chapman from Orange Is the New Black—were all likable women when we first met them. But unfortunate circumstances—the death of a partner or imprisonment—revealed their true, selfish and much more interesting characters. Like Walter White in Breaking Bad, we watched their evolution from victim towards evil. Not so for Rachel and Quinn, who much more closely mirror Don Draper and Tony Soprano—men who were deemed “bad” or “difficult” from their pilot episodes.“We threw the idea of likability out before we even began,” says co-creator Sarah Gertrude Shapiro, a self-described feminist who worked as a producer on The Bachelor for seven years before threatening self harm in order to be released from her contract with the show. “We don’t subscribe to the idea of likability because we don’t think it’s applied to men.”But writing female anti-heroes is more complicated than turning Don Draper into Donna or Tony Soprano into Tonya. Perhaps more important than the characters are the conflicts they face, and those of UnREAL are uniquely tailored to the modern woman. The problem is stated outright on Rachel’s shirt in the first episode—a bold move in the era of “sneaky feminism” on TV shows like Inside Amy Schumer and Broad City. Rachel believes in high-minded principles, but as Shapiro felt herself while working on The Bachelor, she’s had to sacrifice them for the sake of money and the future of her career. As women still grapple with whether to prioritize ambition over likability, it’s liberating for a female audience to watch a character who doesn’t even try to be nice.These new anti-heroes made their debut on Lifetime, long branded as the gauzy “women’s network” and best known for its overdramatic movies featuring victimized women in various states of distress. The creators were initially hesitant to partner with Lifetime on a show that could have easily been at home on HBO or Netflix. But in an effort to rebrand, executives offered Shapiro and Noxon carte blanche to write the darkest, most complex story they could.“Lifetime wants to redefine what ‘television for women’ means,” says Noxon. “The most popular shows among female viewers are all dark: things like Sons of Anarchy, True Blood and Breaking Bad. The executives suspected rightly that there would be an appetite for females who were behaving despicably as well.”This Is What A Feminist Anti-Hero Looks LikeThe Rachel and Quinn dynamic is not a new one to media. The Devil Wears Prada or Damages relationship between cold mentor and naive mentee has cemented itself in pop culture. Amy Schumer’s recent rom-com, Trainwreck, even parodied the “bitchy boss.” But Shapiro and Noxon hoped to complicate that connection.“For Quinn, a really easy place to go with the character is Disney evil queen—older, bitchy, arch, mean, kind of jealous. It could read that way on the page, and a ton of people we saw did that. But it was wrong,” says Shapiro. “Constance [Zimmer] inhabits that character in a way that has so much humanity and humor underneath that we don’t necessarily forgive her, but we understand her.”She’s had practice: Zimmer has built a career playing tough women in supporting roles on shows like Entourage, House of Cards and The Newsroom. But all that experience hasn’t alleviated the fear that people will associate her with her characters’ cruelty. “I was so terrified to play Quinn in the first couple of episodes,” says Zimmer. “When they say cut, I’m apologizing to everyone around me, all the extras. I want to make sure everyone knows I’m not like Quinn. I’m super goofy and silly.” The creators may have thrown out the term “likable” from their script, but in the real world, the expectation that women be genial persists.Still Zimmer recognized the opportunity to build a character arc for the kind of caricatured woman who usually only gets a couple biting lines. “I like playing strong women, but this is different because with the other characters, we never went home with them. With Quinn, we get to see how insecure she is, how she has her own struggles and see that she’s just much better than others at putting on armor,” she says.Rachel, too, defies the typical female character genres—and even the typical female anti-hero. She is a master of manipulation, and even the actor who plays her, Shiri Appleby, was sometimes confused as to whether Rachel was being genuine or calculating when she uttered her lines.“She’s a character that doesn’t really have a lot of friends or anyone to talk to about her emotions. You don’t see her express herself, you just see her actions, which is rare for a female character,” says Appleby. It’s the sort of mystery more often seen in male characters like Don Draper.And conflicts between her ambition and her ethics come to a head in a way rarely seen on screen. Shapiro compares Rachel’s life to a more realistic Devil Wears Prada, where the protege (played by Anne Hathaway in the film) can’t get out from under her cruel mentor’s thumb.“A moment that comes up a lot in the writers’ room is the end of Devil Wears Prada. We always joke about the end of the movie where Anne Hathaway’s character throws her phone into the fountain and leaves the miserable job. In the UnREAL version of that scene, she would be grabbing the phone out of that fountain, putting it in a bag of rice until it dries out and texting her boss asking for her job back,” says Shapiro.Somewhere along the way, the mentee became an expert and Rachel began taking pride in her ability to cleverly tear others down. Like Tony and Don and Walter, she’s good at doing something poisonous.The Girls’ ClubNoxon says that with UnREAL she has entered a small community of female television producers, which includes her sister-in-law and creator of Weeds and Orange Is the New Black Jenji Kohan, Scandal and Grey’s Anatomy creator Shonda Rhimes and Transparent creator Jill Soloway, among others. “Everyone talks about the boys’ club—there’s starting to be a little bit of a girls’ club too,” says Noxon. “We can call each other for support.”With rave reviews from critics, UnREAL has taken its place in a small but growing pantheon of shows created by women about women who are as complicated and conflicted as men have always been on TV.“My mom was a card-carrying feminist lesbian. She literally told me shaving my legs was giving in to the patriarchy,” Noxon says. “I think the idea that feminists have to be strident really turns people off. There were all these rules to being a good feminist, when the truth is, we’re just as conflicted as anybody else.”Shiri Appleby has had some experience with conflicted women. Before she played Rachel, she guest-starred as the girlfriend of Adam (Adam Driver) on Girls, a show that’s taken plenty of flack for featuring unlikable female characters—though Lena Dunham’s Hannah has probably never reached the level of true anti-hero.Appleby draws parallels between Dunham’s methods and those of UnREAL writer Shapiro. “They both write about women in a way that isn’t pretty their work is considered groundbreaking,” says Appleby. “Neither of them want to please people. If anything, they want to make the audience uncomfortable and question their values and morals by telling these real stories about women.”But even though Appleby recognized how rare it was to be cast in projects with a woman’s voice on television, that didn’t prepare her for the fan response. “I didn’t think any of the things we shot on UnREAL were going to be controversial. But then I go online and I see there are these articles and discussions about the episode that begins and ends with Rachel masturbating. That’s fascinating because, like, women use vibrators. They just do. But because TV shows only talk about the way men please themselves, it’s a big deal.”It’s an evolution that comes thanks to disruptors like Hulu and Netflix, which are challenging channels to reach outside their comfort zone by commissioning original series that break away from TV norms. Lifetime is not alone in its effort to enter the race for best prestige drama. This summer, USA Network—defined by dramatic but ultimately sunny serials like Suits, Burn Notice and Psych—offered Sam Esmail the opportunity to turn his strange, edgy movie script about an anti-social, drug addicted vigilante hacker called Mr. Robot into a TV show that critics are now calling one of the best of the year. And last year, the CW took a risk on a critically-acclaimed telenovela spoof Jane the Virgin that earned the network its first Golden Globe for star Gina Rodriguez.Though these shows may not earn Big Bang Theory ratings, neither did Mad Men. The people tuning into these high level dramas are generally doing so via DVR or streaming services like Netflix or Amazon. Not only do the shows earn cachet for the Networks, but they up their value with these streaming service providers as more households cut their cable TV cords.“I couldn’t have gotten this show made five years ago,” says Noxon. “Now television is so targeted. You’re not going for Grey’s Anatomy numbers. You’re doing for a specific demographic.”And although networks may long for shows that can bring in 10 million viewers as Rhimes does for ABC, small, targeted shows can have a massive impact on the culture. The Girls finale drew fewer than 1 million watchers, but the show launched Lena Dunham’s book to the New York Times bestseller list and inspired a thousand think pieces. Netflix doesn’t release how many people tune in to Orange Is the New Black, but one of its stars, Laverne Cox, has made a national impact, landing on the cover of TIME as a leader of the trans movement.How UnREAL might change television has yet to be seen—though it’s clearly already gotten under the skin of Chris Harrison, longtime Bachelor host. But while it’s unlikely that the grim Lifetime show has convinced longtime reality TV devotees to defect, Noxon and Shapiro have proven that there’s room for both the bright-eyed contestants of The Bachelor and the scheming producers of UnREAL on TV. When conducting research for UnREAL, the creators found that the women who tune in to reality romances have an average income of $150,000. Many members of the largely female audience work 90 hour weeks and hold advanced degrees.These career women sometimes like to indulge in the Prince Charming fantasy—and sometimes they want to watch it torn down. Female viewers deserve characters that are just as complicated and contradictory as they are themselves. Those characters have finally arrived.Read Next: Review: In UnREAL, Art Imitates Life Imitating Life

In some cases, the TV screen bends with the touch of a button, giving users the option to watch programs with a flat or curved display.Tim Baxter, president of Samsung Electronics America, says the displays combine HD content "with this curved capability that creates a really immersive experience."Samsung plans to launch an 85-inch bendable TV and 105-inch curved TV in the U.S. later this year.2. Ultra HDUSA TODAY's Jefferson Graham, Ed Baig and Mike Snider check out the huge, beautiful TVs on display at CES 2014 in Las Vegas.Prepare to hear terms such as UHD and 4K often when shopping for a new television. They're the next level of high-definition resolution.So, what are Ultra HD or 4K? They are the same thing: HD resolutions that are four times higher than a broadcast in 1080p, which means video content will look sharper than the current generation of high-definition sets.Sony, LG and Vizio were among the tech titans trotting out UHD and 4K televisions, but brace for huge price tags. For example, LG's 84-inch UHD display is priced at $17,000.Meanwhile, expect to see more content providers catch up on adding UHD content in 2014. YouTube showcased videos in 4K at the show, while Netflix says it will start streaming 4K content later this year. Meanwhile, consumers will soon record their own UHD content with devices such as Sony's 4K camcorder.3.

http://news.yahoo.com/key-developments-case-2-slain-nypd-officers-002517967.html	Key developments in case of 2 slain NYPD officers	Two New York police officers were ambushed last weekend by Ismaaiyl Brinsley after he had made threatening posts online, including references to high-profile cases of white police officers killing unarmed black men and a vow to put "wings on pigs." After shooting the officers, Brinsley ran into a Brooklyn subway station and committed suicide.The killings of Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos have raised concerns in the already tense nationwide debate surrounding police conduct. Some key developments since the officers' killings:___POLICE ON ALERT BEFORE OFFICER'S WAKE, FUNERALNew York police officers remained vigilant against any threats on Thursday as the city readied itself for a wake and a funeral for Ramos.The services are scheduled for Friday and Saturday. Visitors are expected to pay their respects to Ramos at Christ Tabernacle Church in Queens on Friday night. Vice President Joe Biden is expected to attend Ramos' funeral on Saturday.Funeral arrangements for Liu haven't been announced.___PRAYERS AND SUPPORT FOR SLAIN OFFICERSThe Rev. Al Sharpton and the mother and widow of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who died after what a medical examiner determined was a white officer's chokehold, prayed for the families of the two slain officers at a Christmas dinner event.The Garner family observed a moment of silence and prayed while serving meals and handing out toys with Sharpton at the Harlem headquarters of his National Action Network.WABC-TV said widow Esaw Garner told the crowd she shares in the families' suffering and would be more than happy to meet them.Authorities say Brinsley had referenced Garner's death on Instagram before shooting the officers.Sharpton again condemned violence, saying anyone who doesn't "is just trying to create a climate for their own political relevance."In a holiday statement, Gov. Andrew Cuomo mentioned the slain officers and urged people to "offer support to their families any way we can."___CLEVELAND SEA OF BLUE RALLY PLANNEDA police dispatcher who organized a rally scheduled for Saturday in support of officers and invited 500 friends to it says thousands of people plan to attend.Mary Jo Graves decided last Sunday to organize the Sea of Blue Support rally on Cleveland's Public Square by creating a page on Facebook and inviting her friends. She said Thursday that more than 54,000 invites have been sent across the social media website and 4,000 people have indicated they plan to be there."I was hoping to get 100 people to stand with me at Public Square in support of officers, and it kind of blew up," said Graves, who spent nearly 14 years as a Cleveland police dispatcher and the last six in suburban Brooklyn.She said her campaign was prompted by the negative attention and protests directed at police recently.There have been protests across the country since grand juries declined to indict white police officers involved in the killings of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Garner. The fatal shooting of a 12-year-old Cleveland boy who was carrying a pellet gun has prompted numerous protests, including one that shut down a freeway at rush hour.Graves, the sister of a Cleveland police officer, said she thought it was time to stand up in support of law enforcement.___ARRESTSNew York police on Thursday said they had made a total of six arrests of people accused of threatening officers. A seventh man was arrested on gun charges after he was overheard making threats against officers and talking about guns in his home as he spoke on his cellphone at a Queens bank, police said. He was not charged with making threats, they said.

http://www.examiner.com/article/college-football-rankings-week-12-ap-top-25-rewards-alabama-ohio-state	College football rankings Week 12: AP Top 25 rewards Oregon, Ohio State	Week 12 college football rankings: Alabama beat LSU in overtime and moved up to No. 4 in the AP Top 25. Photo by Chris Graythen/Getty ImagesCollege football rankings for Week 12 are already rewarding Oregon and Ohio State. The new AP Top 25 for college football was released on Sunday (Nov. 9), with Mississippi State and Florida State still stop the list. Both schools remained undefeated over the weekend and improved to 9-0 on the season. The Bulldogs drew 48 first place votes and the Seminoles received 12 of them from the writers this time around. The story, though, comes from the big shifts that took place in the top 10.The Oregon Ducks beat Utah on Saturday (Nov. 8) and got rewarded with the No. 3 spot in this poll. Last week the Ducks had been ranked No. 5, but got a boost past Alabama thanks to the writers. Alabama, which struggled against LSU, remained at No. 4 this time around. TCU moved up to No. 5 after beating Kansas State, but couldn’t quite break into one of the playoff spots. They did remain ahead of a Baylor team they already lost to.The rest of the top 10 in these Week 12 college football rankings are Baylor, Arizona State, Ohio State, Auburn, and Ole Miss (in that order). Auburn tumbled after losing to Texas A&M and that allowed several other schools to receive interesting boosts in the latest AP Top 25. Baylor jumped four spots to No. 6, Arizona State went up four spots to No. 7, and the Buckeyes went up five spots to take over No. 8. All three schools have 8-1 records and are starting to play some really good football when all ayes have turned on them.Other teams that took huge hits to their championship aspirations were No. 12 Michigan State (down from No. 7), No. 13 Kansas State (down from No. 9), and No. 15 Notre Dame (down from No. 8). These three schools have likely been eliminated from making it into the playoff this year. New schools to the Associated Press poll this week are 9-1 Colorado State at No. 23 and 8-2 Georgia Tech at No. 24. To make room for them, Oklahoma and West Virginia fell out it.Week 12 College Football Rankings (AP Top 25)1. Mississippi State (48)2. Florida State (12)3. Oregon4. Alabama5. TCU6. Baylor7.

Pelini went on a tirade against the administration when meeting with his players after his firing, with most of the colorful language directed toward athletic director Shawn Eichorst.Update: The Pelini audio has been released by the OWH:I'd encourage you to read the entire OWH article, but here are the most interesting quotes.1. Pelini did not like EichorstHe talked at length about how the administration did not support him and about how he was left in the dark on his future employment status over the past two years. Here's what he thought about that:"I didn't really have any relationship with the A.D.," Pelini said. "The guy, you guys saw him (Sunday), the guy is a total p----. I mean, he is, and he's a total c---."Nebraska players were also very critical of Eichorst's leadership after Pelini's firing.2. Pelini thought administrators were rooting for Nebraska to lose to IowaPelini seemed at peace with being fired after getting blown out at home against Iowa last year, but he was retained. Then this year, after his team came back from a 17-point deficit to beat the Hawkeyes in Iowa City, Pelini did end up losing his job. He claims the administration wanted him to lose.On Dec. 2, Pelini told players he saw anger in administrators' faces when the Huskers beat Iowa in the regular-season finale. They didn't want NU to win.3. Pelini couldn't stand the work environment in NebraskaPelini has had notable issues with the expectations of the Nebraska job before, and was once recorded saying he wanted to tell the Husker faithful "f--- you fans." In the recording from his meeting with his players, Pelini was introspective, and many of his quotes centered around how taxing his job was."I have been at LSU, I have been at Oklahoma, I have been to these other places. The scrutiny, it negativity, it ain't like that everywhere. But it is what it is and you gotta be strong as hell and you gotta stick together to deal with it. You have to. Because it's real, I know it's out there. I've seen it."Nebraska responded to the recording, and as you might guess, they were not happy!

Dallas Cowboys running back Joseph Randle reportedly was arrested for shoplifting at a Dallas-area mall on Monday night. Store employees at Dillard’s in Frisco, Texas detained Randle, per the Dallas Morning News, and he later was charged with theft, a Class B misdemeanor. The stolen items are allegedly valued between $50 and $500. [Join FanDuel's $500,000 Week 7 fantasy league: $10 to enter; top 10,102 teams paid]According to the Fort-Worth Star Telegram's Clarence Hill, Randle was trying to lift a few, um, personal items.Yes, Randle was busted for stealing a bottle of cologne and underwear..— Clarence Hill (@clarencehilljr) October 14, 2014Per a source, Randle was busted by video surveillance— Clarence Hill (@clarencehilljr) October 14, 2014Randle was a fifth-round pick in 2013 out of Oklahoma State who signed a four-year rookie contract valued at $2.35 million. He was released from Frisco City Jail on Tuesday morning after posting bond.This has to annoy the Cowboys after a massive victory Sunday against the Seattle Seahawks in which Randle played a key role, rushing for 52 yards on five carries — including a 38-yarder — against a top defense.If the Cowboys are serious about reducing the heroic workload of DeMarco Murray, one of the league's MVP candidates who has 43 more carries than any NFL back right now, they're going to have to rely on a player such as Randle to help.- - - - - - -Eric Edholm is a writer for Shutdown Corner on Yahoo Sports.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-fat-jew-vs-the-internet_55d2360de4b07addcb43ad7f	The Internet Made 'The Fat Jew,' And Now It Could Take Him Down	Josh Ostrovsky -- or, as 5.7 million people on Instagram know him, The Fat Jew -- was living your typical Cinderella story of Internet fame ... until this week.People liked his sense of humor. He landed a modeling contract, a book deal, an ad campaign, a contract with talent agency CAA for "representation in all areas," and launched his own rosé. According to a recent Financial Times profile, his income from advertising alone -- brands will pay $6,000 for him to mention their products on his Instagram -- may be "running at a rate of several hundred thousand dollars a year." He can also charge appearance fees for events.In recent weeks, however, some of the Internet denizens who helped make him a star have seemed hellbent on bringing him crashing down to Earth. It's all a fuss over the Internet's Golden Rule from the early days of blogging: If you use someone's work, credit and link back. Original creators should be acknowledged and rewarded. It applies everywhere from message boards like Reddit to news sites -- this one included. "If it’s my stuff you’re posting, and if you give me credit, then I get traffic to my site, maybe that traffic goes to my comedy album and then I get paid for my work," comedian Davon Magwood wrote in a bristling open letter to Ostrovsky on his website. That traffic is good for plain, old-fashioned exposure, but if a individual's website contains ads, it also leads to a more concrete perk: revenue.Many, many, many, many different sites are pointing their digital pitchforks at Ostrovsky for breaking that most sacred rule of Internet publishing -- posting creative work without proper attribution. Some even accuse him of malicious cropping in order to obscure a watermark or other identifying information. Internet aside, the Golden Rule of comedy has long been this: Don't steal jokes. Posting without credit, some argue, is akin to breaking that rule, too. But often, tracking down an image on the Internet is easier said than done."It can be tricky to find the original source of the content," Katie Schurman, who posts some original and some aggregated content to her Instagram for 57,600 followers, told The Huffington Post in an email. "If I repost an image, I will try to give credit to the original creator if I know absolutely who it is."That's not a problem if you have 50 followers, or even 500. Friends share memes with friends every day. But once your follower account reaches Fat-Jew levels, there's money to be made off the Internet's gnat-like attention by both the Instagram user and the creator of the original work. At that point, it's fair to ask if the onus is on the user with a massive audience to dig around and figure out whose work he's sharing, especially if he's pulling in money or other tangible perks.To his credit, Ostrovsky has been sealing each of his Instagram posts with a credit for the past several weeks. But that credit sometimes goes to the blog where he found it, the social media equivalent of a blogger's hat tip. That's fine if it's where the content originated, but by the time Ostrovsky plucks a lol-worthy image from the ocean of Internet content, it very well may have traveled between several social media platforms -- Reddit, Tumblr, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram -- and, along its journey, been altered to remove the creator's fingerprints. (Ostrovsky's publicist declined multiple requests for comment on this story.) On Aug. 17, Ostrovsky credited an image with text reading, "The international hand symbol for 'what the hell is this guy doing?'" to Schurman. A quick Google search for "The international hand symbol for 'what the hell is this guy doing,'" however, reveals an earlier poster: Twitter user TheFunnyTeens. Whether TheFunnyTeens originally found the image and placed text over it remains unclear. But for less than a minute's worth of effort, we're at least a little bit closer to the source.Another post, an image of a dog with a severe overbite reading, "When u get all comfy on the couch and realize the remote is across the room," is inexplicably credited to defamerican, who appears to be friends with Ostrovsky. The image was originally captioned by Tom Curtin -- according to a still-visible credit in Ostrovsky's post -- with an original photo by tunameltsmyheart, an Instagram-famous dog owner. Aram French is one cartoonist whose work -- a comic showing a pumpkin-headed woman ordering a "human spice latte" -- Ostrovsky posted without credit. He told HuffPost in an email that Ostrovsky's failure to track down and post original images with all credit information intact was unacceptable to him."One or two times could be put down to ignorance or laziness, but his behavior is [habitual]," he wrote, adding that "a reverse image search on Google only takes a few seconds."Whoa. Trippy. A photo posted by thefatjewish (@thefatjewish) on Oct 22, 2014 at 3:07pm PDTAram French's cartoon, posted without credit.Ostrovsky presents himself as easily reachable -- his personal email, Emalio.Addresstevez@gmail.com, is right in his Instagram bio -- but some requests for attribution by the original artists have gone unanswered.Artist Saint Hoax emailed Ostrovsky after finding an image he'd created -- imagined Michael Jackson emojis -- on Instagram sans credit. In the silence that followed, Saint Hoax told HuffPost that he tagged @thefatjewish in another work he'd posted to his own Instagram account as a kind of digital tap on the shoulder. Nothing. A week later, that exact image showed up on Ostrovsky's account. Saint Hoax's logo had been cropped out. "I completely understand that he reposts existing content on the Internet," the artist said. "[There's] no harm in that, a lot of people do this. But it's not that difficult to find who the source is."French also couldn't convince Ostrovsky to add his name, despite actually getting a response from him on Twitter. His cartoon remains uncredited. At this point, however, the post is so buried in The Fat Jew's Instagram feed that French would receive little to no attention if the caption was even updated. "One of the followers of 'thefatjewish' says in my comment sections, 'That’s how social media works,'" Magwood wrote. Meaning that anything we post to the Internet may be stolen and repurposed as fast as it takes to tap ﻿copy, paste.﻿ But Magwood disagrees. "It shouldn't be the nature of the beast."Nerds and lawmakers sometimes refer to the Internet today as the new Wild West. We're still figuring out how to police it. And while Ostrovsky is making headlines, he's far from the only one aggregating content from different corners of the Internet. Others run rampant, impeded by only the (often unspoken) Golden Rule.Elliot Tebele, for example, runs the Instagram humor account fuckjerry, which counts about 100,000 more followers than Ostrovsky and earns him an income. A similar account, Daddyissues_, counts 1.8 million followers. Tebele's wife Jessica Anteby runs beigecardigan, with 1.2 million followers. That's on par with girlwithnojob, who also receives perks for her Internet fame. Any of these could be accused of "stealing" because of their lack of given attribution, but, in the Internet age, the line between an amateur curator sharing with friends and a professional curator sharing for income is blurry. (None of these account holders responded to request for comment by publication.)It's a messy subject and a new terrain, one filled with lots of clear questions and unclear answers. One thing is obvious, though: When credit is given where credit is due, everybody wins.After seeing his work reposted without credit on thefatjewish and other social media pages, a comedy writer who goes by Trevor S. told HuffPost about the first time Ostrovsky credited a joke of his. He did so at the time it was posted, too -- a key detail. Within two minutes, the writer said, he had 7,000 new followers. Brands contacted him wanting to chat. Ostrovsky reached out to Trevor S., and the two met for drinks in New York. "I was fully prepared to not like him," Trevor S. admitted, "but he was immediately and disarmingly very likable."Bearded and jolly-looking, with an unnaturally vertical ponytail (his "Jew unicorn" or "hair erection"), The Fat Jew is also immediately recognizable to the Instagram crowd. His digital fame was not lost on the other patrons -- Trevor S. recalled people coming over to ask for pictures with Ostrovsky. People sent drinks to their table. Mothers wanted to put daughters' numbers in their phones. While Ostrovsky is now pretty good about crediting Trevor S.'s work, the writer still remembers what it was like on the other side. "I know a lot of these people in real life and they bust their asses trying to make it," he said of the comics and writers who aren't happy with accounts like thefatjewish and fuckjerry. "I'm really grateful to Josh for the way he credits me." "If @thefatjewish properly credited my posts," Saint Hoax wrote, "my work would've been exposed to over 5.7 million followers and he would've probably attracted thousands of new people to my account, which I make money out of.""He needs to credit his sources, period," French said.It's nice to imagine a Utopic future where, through some Silicon Valley magic, everyone who takes part in launching a social media page to stardom can share its success in an even more concrete way. Imagine a comedian whose joke gets 300,000 social media "likes," and, in thanks, gets a little slice of the account owner's revenue. Content creators are everywhere, and content distributors -- the most popular Internet blogs and personalities -- are relatively few. That imbalance could shift if Internet users agree on the necessity, and definition, of giving credit. (Are you out there, disruptors? We're throwing your bat signal into the sky.)
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/11/25/with-no-indictment-chaos-fills-ferguson-streets/20998579/	With no indictment, chaos fills Ferguson streets	FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) - Chaos returned to the streets of Ferguson after a grand jury declined to indict a white police officer in the death of Michael Brown - a decision that enraged protesters who set fire to buildings and cars and looted businesses in the area where the unarmed, black 18-year-old was fatally shot.Monday night's destruction appeared to be much worse than last summer's protests, with at least a dozen businesses badly damaged or destroyed. Authorities reported hearing hundreds of gunshots, which for a time prevented fire crews from fighting the flames.Jon Belmar, chief of the St. Louis County police, said that unless his agency could bring in 10,000 officers, "I don't think we can prevent folks who really are intent on destroying a community."The grand jury's decision means that officer Darren Wilson, who is white, will not face any state criminal charges for killing Brown, whose death inflamed deep racial tensions between many black Americans and police.Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch said the jury of nine whites and three blacks met on 25 separate days over three months, hearing more than 70 hours of testimony from about 60 witnesses, including three medical examiners and experts on blood, toxicology and firearms."They are the only people that have heard and examined every witness and every piece of evidence," he said, adding that the jurors "poured their hearts and soul into this process."In the first flash of unrest after the grand jury announcement, Belmar said he told officers to back off, suggesting they handle the situation as if it were a festival or baseball game. But the situation quickly "spun out of control." Officers eventually lobbed tear gas from inside armored vehicles to disperse crowds.As McCulloch read his statement, Michael Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, sat atop a vehicle listening to a broadcast of the announcement. When she heard the decision, she burst into tears and began screaming before being whisked away by supporters.The crowd with her erupted in anger, converging on the barricade where police in riot gear were standing. They pushed down the barricade and began pelting police with objects, including a bullhorn. Officers stood their ground.Speaking for nearly 45 minutes, a defensive McCulloch repeatedly cited what he said were inconsistencies and erroneous accounts from witnesses. When asked by a reporter whether any of the accounts amount to perjury, he said, "I think they truly believe that's what they saw, but they didn't."The prosecutor also was critical of the media, saying "the most significant challenge" for his office was a "24-hour news cycle and an insatiable appetite for something - for anything - to talk about."In his statement, McCulloch never mentioned that Brown was unarmed when he was killed.Brown's family released a statement saying they were "profoundly disappointed" in the decision but asked that the public "channel your frustration in ways that will make a positive change. We need to work together to fix the system that allowed this to happen."Shortly after the announcement, authorities released more than 1,000 pages of grand jury documents, including Wilson's testimony.Wilson told jurors that he initially encountered Brown and a friend walking in a street and, when he told them to move to a sidewalk, Brown responded with an expletive.Wilson then noticed that Brown had a handful of cigars, "and that's when it clicked for me," he said, referring to a radio report minutes earlier of a robbery at a nearby convenience store.Wilson said he asked a dispatcher to send additional police, then backed his vehicle up in front of Brown and his friend. As he tried to open the door, Wilson said Brown slammed it back shut.The officer said he then pushed Brown with the door and Brown hit him in the face. Wilson told grand jurors he was thinking: "What do I do not to get beaten inside my car.""I drew my gun," Wilson told the grand jury. "I said, "Get back or I'm going to shoot you.""He immediately grabs my gun and says, "You are too much of a pussy to shoot me," Wilson told grand jurors. He said Brown grabbed the gun with his right hand, twisted it and "digs it into my hip."Asked why he felt the need to pull his gun, Wilson told grand jurors he was concerned another punch to his face could "knock me out or worse."After shots were fired in the vehicle, Brown fled, and Wilson gave chase. At some point, Brown turned around to face the officer.Witness accounts were conflicted about whether Brown walked, stumbled or charged back toward Wilson before he was fatally wounded, McCulloch said. There were also differing accounts of how or whether Brown's hands were raised. His body fell about 153 feet from Wilson's vehicle.Thousands of people rallied in other U.S. cities, and President Barack Obama appealed for calm and understanding, pleading with both protesters and police to show restraint."We are a nation built on the rule of law, so we need to accept that this decision was the grand jury's to make," Obama said. He said it was understandable that some Americans would be angered, but echoed Brown's parents in calling for any protests to be peaceful.The danger extended beyond the streets. At least 10 St. Louis-bound flights were diverted to other airports because of concern about gunfire being aimed into the sky over Ferguson, the Federal Aviation Administration said.The Justice Department is conducting a separate investigation into possible civil rights violations that could result in federal charges, but investigators would need to satisfy a rigorous standard of proof in order to mount a prosecution. The department also has launched a broad probe into the Ferguson Police Department, looking for patterns of discrimination.Regardless of the outcome of those investigations, Brown's family could also file a wrongful-death lawsuit against Wilson.The Aug. 9 shooting heightened tensions in the predominantly black St. Louis suburb that is patrolled by an overwhelmingly white police force. As Brown's body lay for hours in the center of a residential street, an angry crowd of onlookers gathered. Rioting and looting occurred the following night, and police responded with armored vehicles and tear gas.Protests continued for weeks - often peacefully, but sometimes turning violent, with demonstrators throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails and police firing smoke canisters, tear gas and rubber bullets. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon briefly summoned the National Guard.Throughout the investigation, some black leaders and Brown's parents questioned McCulloch's ability to be impartial. The prosecutor's father, mother, brother, uncle and cousin all worked for the St. Louis Police Department, and his father was killed while responding to a call involving a black suspect in 1964.McCulloch was 12 at the time, and the killing became a hallmark of his initial campaign for elected prosecutor.A Democrat, McCulloch has been in office since 1991 and was re-elected to another term earlier this month.
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/11/24/weve-seen-that-before-bleona-steals-rose-mcgowans-infamous-nu/20998253/	We've seen that before! Bleona steals Rose McGowan's infamous nude dress	WARNING: Photos are revealing"Euros of Hollywood" star Bleona Qereti sure knows how to make an entrance.The 35-year-old singer turned heads at the 2014 American Music Awards on Sunday when she hit the red carpet in a barely-there mesh dress outfitted with thong underwear and nipple pasties to cover her lady parts.The Albanian-born pop star polished off her wild style with sleek locks, red lipstick and a pair of sky-high heels.The outrageous look certainly was eye-catching, but it didn't earn her a spot on the best-dressed list or any points for originality.Over a decade ago, Rose McGowan donned a similar style when she headed to the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards with then-boyfriend Marilyn Manson.McGowan caused quite a stir when she strolled to the awards show in a backless mesh and chain number and a leopard print thong. Unlike Bleona, McGowan forewent pasties and revealed her bare breasts.

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/PM-asks-for-speech-pointers-might-be-left-speechless/articleshow/48541481.cms	PM asks for speech pointers, might be left speechless	In a first, Narendra Modi is crowdsourcing ideas for his Independence Day speech, asking for suggestions from netizens.But is he prepared to listen to everyone, from the over-enthu cutlets to those with 'grand' ideas for the country?On August 15 every year, our prime minister gives the Independence Day ad dress from the ramparts of the Red Fort. In his Mann Ki Baat session on July 26, Narendra Modi had sought ideas and suggestions from citizens on what he should include in this year's Independence Day speech. His idea-crowdsourcing plea certainly brought many to come forward with their two-pennyworth — there were around 11,622 responses on mygov.in by Thursday morning. We sifted The homepage of mygov.in, which asks peopl through the lot, and while most suggestions were about tackling corruption, poverty, communalism, reservations, road safety measures, pollution, population control, lack of respect for women and the elderly, et al, many of the suggestions suggested that their writers had gone overboard with their patriotism or assumed that Modi has the Midas touch to fix everything. Here are some gems that we're hoping might make their way into the PM's speech, since we all know he has a sense of humour:Hello hi chhodiye, Jai Hind boliye:Sample this — a desi Tom Cruise telling a Renee Zellweger, "You had me at Jai Hind". If this tip is taken seriously, we might soon be deleting 'hello' and 'hi' from our vocabulary. Respected sir, please make a rule that each and every citizen of India should say jai hind instead of hellohi — Dhanashri VaishaliUnity without diversity:There are quite a few suggestions on doing away with borders and making a unified India. We could almost hear SRK saying, 'mujhe states ke naam na sunai dete hain, na dikhai dete hain.Sirf ek mulk ka naam sunai deta hai — INDIA'. And of course, many want 'India' to be called Hindustan or Bharat. I want suggest (sic) that PM should make announcement for pride of every citizen as follows Currently we are using number plates on vehicles that only mentions its state name as MH 09 AR 2175. There should be name of country before state as IndBharat then number of vehicles. Exp. IndBharat MH 09 AR 2175. This small thing would make feel pride about India — Rohit Ashoksing RajputIndia needs transformers:And here's some Hollywood inspiration.I want India to be king of Indian OCEAN Why not Indian govt launch a research and development of Convertible War ShipsSubmarines aircraft carriers. A ship which can converted to submarine if it is attacked in the same way a Submarine can be converted to Aircraft Carrier to attack the enemy. if need can stay hidden for years in the Ocean Water without any out side support.

Here's how to make good use of that.India's current strength is presence of mas sive youth ... Our youth learns a lot from movies rather than books ... So I request Modiji to sug gest film directors to make films on student's psychology, failures and successes, real lives of great students, value of scientists and science ... I bet so many student's mindset has changed greatly after watching 3 Idiots ... We need more movies like 3 Idiots and we are ready to learn from them — Anil Kumar DonthaganiApna wala Facebook, Twitter:With Satya Nadella and Sundar Pichai now heading Microsoft and Google respectively, a call was made to the Shivs Shivams made to the Shivs Shivams working in Apple, Facebook and Twitter to rise up to the occasion and head those companies to make the 'Satyam Shivam Sundaram' in tech complete. But these guys want more — desi social networking, no less.Our dear prime minister should endorse indian versions of twitter googlemapsfacebook etc.While search engines appear very innocent, they collect details of each citizens. In a war like situation(economic war or even conventional) these details can be very strategic hence its an issue of national security that a foreign country can have details of each of another country's citizens.Russia and China therefore have banned these sites in their country. High time India did something on those lines — Sharad Tiwari_3Objection to obesity:Recently, an initiative was floated to give free poha and sprouts to bureaucrats who stay back late at work.

Is Gruden on his way out? Photo by Joe Robbins/Getty ImagesAn anonymous teammate blasts Robert Griffin III, and unfortunately that seems to be commonplace in Washington these days. According to a NESN report, teammates of the former Heisman Trophy winner from Baylor are becoming more and more irritated with his antics and according to reports the Robert Griffin III era in Washington may be coming to a close.Griffin has suffered numerous injuries since entering the NFL, but excuses aside, he has played terrible this season. RG3 was benched in favor of Colt McCoy a few weeks ago and ever since there have been nothing but rumblings coming out of DC.“No one is happy … no one gets the hype around him anymore,” the teammate reportedly told TMZ Sports. “He’s secluded and it affects us in the game,” the teammate told TMZ. “We don’t have that real rapport. He’s lost confidence and is complacent now.This kind of news has to drive Washington owner Daniel Snyder up a wall. Ever since Snyder bought the team back in May of 1999, he has poured out millions on players and coaches that have never panned out. After taking a chance on first time head coach Jay Gruden, things seem to be a bigger mess now than they were in the final year that Mike Shanahan was the man in charge.Was Gruden the wrong hire for this team, or is RG3 just not all that he was hyped up to be? Either way the Redskins are still running in neutral.

http://sports.yahoo.com/news/browns-thomas-accused-environmental-violations-163430158--nfl.html	Browns' Thomas broke environment rules?	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Wisconsin officials have accused Cleveland Browns lineman Joe Thomas of committing nearly a dozen environmental violations on his hunting land west of Madison.The state Department of Natural Resources sent the former Wisconsin Badgers standout and seven-time Pro Bowler a letter Wednesday accusing him of 11 violations. They range from building bridges and dams and enlarging a pond without permits to tearing down a barn without notice of intent and discharging manure into a wetland.DNR officials want to meet with Thomas on Jan. 6 - after the regular season ends - to discuss the allegations. Some of the violations are punishable by fines of $10,000 for every day in violation, the letter says, but doesn't offer details on the number of days.DNR spokesman Bob Manwell declined to comment on the violations.Thomas plans to attend the January meeting if the Browns don't make the playoffs, he said after practice Friday. He said he bought the land about three years ago and hired a contractor to remove buildings on it.Thomas said he didn't realize the process they had to go through with the DNR and was surprised to receive the violation letter. He thought the agency had decided to settle things by issuing after-the-fact permits, he said.''I guess I'm a little surprised by how the process has gone because we're working together in a lock-step as a partnership with the same goals, trying to get the same outcomes, and so I guess I'm kind of surprised it's blown up into a big deal,'' he said.The letter also accuses developer Patrick O'Connor and Darrick Luck, who runs a company called Old Wood New Use, LLC, of the same violations. Old Wood New Use demolishes old buildings and recycles any material from them that's still usable.O'Connor told The Associated Press in an email Friday that he helped Thomas purchase the land in 2012. It was littered with old farm equipment and dilapidated buildings, O'Connor said. Thomas hired Luck in May to demolish the structures and Connor along with some friends cleaned up the trash.An anonymous tipster mistakenly reported a manure spill they drained water from a manure storage basin, O'Connor said. Thomas subsequently obtained a manure structure closing permit from county officials, he said.Thomas was waiting for the paperwork for retroactive permits when he got Wednesday's letter, O'Connor said.''There is no issue here,'' he wrote. ''The real story is Joe and his family should be receiving an award for cleaning up an environmental eyesore.''Luck declined comment to The Associated Press on Friday morning, but told the State Journal it was ''crazy'' for the DNR to demand notification prior to demolition.Thomas was a 2006 consensus All-American and first-team All-Big Ten player at Wisconsin. He also became the first Badger to win the Outland Trophy, an award recognizing college football's top interior lineman.The Browns selected Thomas in the first round of the 2007 NFL draft. He's never missed a snap during his pro career and has twice been named the Walter Payton Man of the Year.The environmental allegations came one day after local media selected Thomas as the Browns' player of the year.---Associated Press Sports Writer Tom Withers in Berea, Ohio, contributed to this report.
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/15/bigfoot-animal-planet_n_1237461.html?ref=weird-news	The Infrared Hunt For Bigfoot	The "Finding Bigfoot" team includes (from left) Cliff Barackman, James "Bobo" Fay, Ranae Holland and Matt Moneymaker.Armed with a military-type array of special night-vision and infrared technology, a group of determined hunters has only one mutual outcome on their collective mind: "Finding Bigfoot."That's exactly what the four-person team of Animal Planet's popular series hopes to accomplish, finding ultimate evidence that groups of tall, hairy, human-like animals exist in the forest and wilderness areas of the world."People have been describing these types of animals in many different parts of North America for well over 400 years -- that's indisputable, that people have described seeing them," said Matt Moneymaker, founder and president of the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization, or BFRO, a network of scientists and amateur researchers interested in Bigfoot and its reported "cousins": Sasquatch, Yeti and the Abominable Snowman.Bigfoot Through The Years: (story continues after the gallery)"Our mission is mutifaceted. We collect information and go out in the field to see if we can find scientific evidence, and in that process, try to figure out how these things can be studied scientifically," Moneymaker told The Huffington Post.According to BFRO's files, since 1996, the number of Bigfoot sightings -- including those with visual evidence -- have produced nearly 32,000 reports.Those numbers didn't escape the attention of the Animal Planet channel, which teamed Moneymaker and BFRO member James "Bobo" Fay with educator Cliff Barackman and skeptical research biologist Ranae Holland.Week after week, this determined quartet of Bigfoot hunters goes deep into wilderness areas of North America that most viewers only experience in nightmares.Watch: The 'Finding Bigfoot' Team On A Nighttime Hunt:As the skeptic of the group, Holland is often caught between those who believe 100 percent in the existence of Bigfoot -- like her three "Finding Bigfoot" companions -- and skeptics, like herself, who think all Bigfoot tales are nonsense."I completely understand and I can relate to where they're coming from," she told Huffington Post. "Yes, I'm skeptical and I still haven't seen the evidence. I can't tell someone they're wrong, nor can I say that I'm right, or we're both wrong and the believers are right."The ultimate goal of both BFRO and the "Finding Bigfoot" team is to come up with irrefutable evidence that some previously undiscovered species of ape that walks bipedally has successfully eluded capture for centuries.The bulk of the evidence consists of many footprints, alleged hair samples, photographs and films and, of course, eyewitness accounts.Probably the most controversial piece of evidence that has been analyzed and scrutinized by believers and skeptics over decades is a piece of film from 1967 widely known as the Patterson film.Watch The Patterson Film Here:Shot by Roger Patterson and Robert Gimlin at Bluff Creek in northern California, the film depicts a tall -- reportedly 7 feet high -- hairy animal walking near the creek, away from the two shocked men. As the creature walks toward the woods, it briefly glances over its shoulder at the men.The animal walked into the woods and into history as the short film has been carefully examined, frame by frame, by researchers and scientists on both sides of the Bigfoot issue, with many believing Bigfoot was merely a man in a costume."Contrary to what many people assumed, the footage has never been proved to be a hoax," said BFRO's Moneymaker. "And every scientific examination and analysis of the footage has either fallen into the category of inconclusive or demonstrating something that can't be explained by 1967 technology."Many imposters have claimed to be the man in the costume and all of them have been debunked by people who were there," he added.And what about "Finding Bigfoot's" skeptical scientist's take on the Patterson footage?"When you look at that film now, and I hear people talking about bulging muscles and fingers moving [see image above], those can very easily be artifacts from the film itself or from later generation copies of it," Holland suggested."Physical anthropologists argue both sides of the issue over whether or not it's possible for a human to recreate the walk of the Patterson Bigfoot," she continued. "There's an argument based on the film speed and the camera lens. There are so many elements of this that add to the controversy."Holland wants compelling, overwhelming, definitive evidence of Bigfoot."I just want to know one way or another. Do I want it to be some prehistoric offshoot of man or an independent species, or just an undiscovered primate? First and foremost, I want to know one way or the other."Moneymaker wants to know, too. Especially since he has a vivid memory of the early morning scary encounter he had in 1994 at the Berlin Wildlife Refuge in Portage County, Ohio."There were two animals -- one was much bigger than the other. It came to the tree line right behind me about 15 feet away," he recalled. "It stood there in front of me and growled. If it had been daylight or I'd had the chance to shine a light on it, I would've been able to draw the face, but it was most definitely a Sasquatch -- over 7 feet tall and it was growling at me to let me know I should leave, and I did."It wasn't even ferocious, but the message was real clear."Now in its second season, "Finding Bigfoot" continues to take viewers into remote areas of the U.S. and Canada.

http://www.alternet.org/personal-health/how-coca-colas-obesity-pr-stunt-blew-companys-face	How Coca Cola's Obesity PR Stunt Blew Up in the Company's Face	The soft drink industry is in a full-blown crisis. Soda sales are on a 10-year skid, and laws are being passed to tax and limit their sales, thanks to a growing consensus among health researchers that sugary beverages are the primary culprits behind obesity and related conditions like diabetes and heart disease. Coca Cola’s PR tactics have become increasingly desperate and insidious. A 2013 television commercial suggested that the 139 calories in a can of Coke could be burned by 75 seconds of laughing out loud, or a celebratory dance while bowling, claims that were roundly criticized at the time. It recently came out that Coke is using a similar tactic, but with a more serious, respectable veneer, when the New York Times reported the company’s undisclosed ties to the nonprofit astroturf group Global Energy Balance Network, a relationship that included lots of money, and even secretly registering the GEBNs website on its own domain.This isn’t the first time makers of dangerous products have found ways to claim evidence against them is inconclusive, or have funded supposedly independent research programs that purport to search for the “real” roots of the problem. The tobacco industry stalled for years by using public information campaigns to create controversy over established facts about the dangers of smoking. The gun lobby borrowed these tactics to promote the idea that having lots of unregulated guns around keeps us safe, even as our rate of gun-related deaths ballooned compared to other countries.Such tactics are sometimes referred to as “misdirection,” which in the case of the tobacco and gun lobbies has been defined as “[altering] the nature of the debate until it is winnable, or at least not loseable. In some instances stalemate will do. If new information arises that shows an existing position to be wrong, move on to another.”The mission of the GEBN, per its website, is, “To connect and engage multi-disciplinary scientists and other experts around the globe dedicated to applying and advancing the science of energy balance to achieve healthier living.” The “science of energy balance” refers to the well-established fact that what you eat is only part of what determines your weight. The other part is how many calories you burn.This message is particularly dangerous for the simple reason that it’s largely true, and on the surface it’s hard to find fault with a pro-exercise message. But the fact that gaps remain in our understanding of the relationship between diet, exercise and health does not mean we should alter the prevailing consensus about the dangers of soda. But that is what GEBN threatens to do; its message implies that if you do more exercise, you can enjoy more Coke.But while exercise burns calories, it also increases appetite, which can lead to more eating, which can replace all of those burned calories. People who eat more sugar can become insulin-resistant, so their bodies make more insulin, which leads to more fat deposition.  And foods that are high in fiber, like nuts, lead to less weight gain per calorie than foods with a similar amount of calories but less fiber, like, say, Coca Cola. While it is possible to outrun a bad diet, there is no question that it’s easier to manage your weight by focusing on what you eat. Much easier. But GEBN threatens to question this reality, just the same, by misdirecting the focus on obesity and related conditions away from diet and toward energy balance.GEBN's website states: "People can be in energy balance at any body weight or BMI, whether lean, overweight, or obese. This simply means that body weight is stable and neither increasing or decreasing.”This statement is true, but also subtly misleading. It implies that being in energy balance is equivalent to being healthy. But if one is obese, then being in energy balance means maintaining that unhealthy weight level. Skinny people, meanwhile, can have dangerously high blood sugar levels as well.“Scales don't measure the presence or absence of health, they measure the gravitational pull of the earth,” explained Yoni Freedhoff, who first discovered GEBN’s ties to Coca Cola and outed it to the New York Times.  “So yes, if you're not gaining, your weight can be described as being representative of energy balance. Whether or not you can be described as being healthy would depend on whether or not you were actually healthy.”I reached out via email to Marianella Herrera, a member of the GEBN executive committee who received the Liberty Mutual Foundation’s 2010 Diabetes Research Award in Venezuela. When I asked her if she felt she was part of a Coca Cola PR campaign, she responded, “Absolutely not.”Dr. Herrera is a well-respected, highly credentialed authority on diabetes, and I have no reason to doubt her integrity. She acknowledged that her lab is funded by Coca Cola, and that she knew about Coca Cola’s relationship with GEBN from the beginning, but claimed that the conflict-of-interest forms signed by the members of the executive board eliminated the possibility that the funding GEBN received from Coca Cola would in any way influence their results. If any of her team’s results weren’t friendly to Coca Cola,  she would still publish them, she said. “Results are results and should be taken into account for solving the problems.”Herrera’s intentions may be pure as the driven snow, but the odds are not in favor of this claim. According to nutrition and public health professor Marion Nestle, 83 percent of research funded by Coca Cola has concluded that drinking sugary beverages is not harmful.“Motivated bias isn’t nefarious, it’s human nature,” Yoni Freedhoff told me.When I asked Herrera if sugary beverages like Coca Cola have a place in a healthy diet, I got a typical answer that lays the responsibility on the shoulders of individual consumers:More than say that sugary beverages can or cannot be a part of a healthy diet, let’s see facts: American Diabetes Association has a recommendation that people should limit the intake of sugary beverages because too much sugar is linked to developing type 2 diabetes, but also make the statement that if you want to consume sweets you should also take into consideration how you substitute the consumption of other carbs in your diet. In other words, watch what you are eating and drinking. Is it bad to have a coke? No. Is it bad to drink 6 cans of coke a day? Yes, that might get you into trouble, as could get you into trouble eating a whole cake on a regular basis or a tin of ice cream every other day! Herrera's response went on for 560 words. I showed Herrera’s response to Freedhoff, who was impressed with the “gymnastics,” as he put it, that she went to in order to dance around my straightforward question. Freedhoff offered this succinct alternative: “Sugary beverages are a treat, but not a healthful one, and consequently the right amount to include in your diet is the smallest amount you need to enjoy your life.”I asked another GEBN executive board member, Wendy Brown, director of the Center for Research on Exercise, Physical Activity and Health at the University of Queensland, how far someone would have to run in order to burn off a can of Coke. “This is exactly the sort of knowledge and understanding we are trying to promote. Most people have no idea how much movement is needed to balance their energy intake,” she said. The answer is based on the person’s weight, and the level of activity, as well as their genes. In other words, it’s complicated.This complexity might very well be in Coca Cola’s best interest, because it makes it impossible to say, in sound bites, how much a person will have to do in order to work off a can of Coke. And obscuring that answer for as long as possible, while misdirecting the discussion away from simple, well-established facts, might be the best-case scenario for future sales. Muddying the issue even keeps alive the idea that laughing out loud for a minute and a half might actually burn off a can of Coke’s worth of calories. But what it’s really doing is kicking the can down the road.If GEBN truly wanted to clear up the relationship between diet, exercise and weight, it wouldn’t have much to do at all. That work has been done. And the results aren’t what Coca Cola wants to hear.But in a video announcing the creation of GEBN, its vice-president Steven Blair had this to say: “Most of the focus in the popular media and in the scientific press is, ‘Oh they’re eating too much, eating too much, eating too much’ — blaming fast food, blaming sugary drinks and so on. And there’s really virtually no compelling evidence that that, in fact, is the cause.” It doesn’t help Dr. Blair’s case that this video is creepy as hell. He never once looks at the camera. Bottles of Coke and Sprite make a cameo. And Blair looks like he could use a few laps around the track himself.As for his words, I suppose it’s grammatically correct that there is no compelling evidence that fast food and sugary drinks are THE cause of obesity, because one could gain weight by just eating straight sugar on the couch. Nonetheless, those comments are shamefully misleading, especially given they were made without disclosing GEBN’s cozy relationship with Coke.There are mountains of evidence that soda consumption is a major contributor to chronic health conditions like obesity, type-2 diabetes and coronary artery disease. By misdirecting the discussion away from diet and shifting the focus onto exercise, or lack thereof, Coca Cola is following a trail blazed by Big Tobacco and followed by the gun lobby: change the debate into one that is winnable, or at least to one that hasn’t already been lost. These tactics may be good for a few more years’ worth of sugary sales, but the wagons will continue to circle. And as Big Tobacco found out the hard way, attempts to obscure known truths can carry a hefty price tag. window.ActionSproutEmbed('F533B4');
http://gma.yahoo.com/brittany-maynards-husband-wanted-spend-life-her-165200764--abc-news-topstories.html	Brittany Maynard's Husband Wanted to Spend His Life With Her	The husband of death with dignity advocate Brittany Maynard, who ended her life this weekend, said that when he met Maynard he had found "the person I want to spend the rest of my life with."Dan Diaz, 43, and Maynard, 29, were married a little more than two years when she died.Diaz spoke with People.com last month on the finals days of his wife's life as she struggled with terminal brain cancer. Maynard ended her life Saturday surrounded by her husband and other family members.Brittany Maynard Died Just as She WantedBrittany Maynard: New Face of Right-to-DieTerminally Ill Woman Fulfills Bucket-List WishDiaz told People.com that when they met in 2007, he was struck by her physical beauty and also "what a beautiful person she was on the inside," he told People.com."She's just a great person to know; a good person to be around: attractive, energetic and outgoing and just a personality you really get attracted to," Diaz said.He proposed to Maynard, whose struggle with terminal illness captivated the nation this past month, "on bended knee" in May 2012.Despite being 14 years older than Maynard, Diaz said he knew marriage was the right choice."Jokingly, she would say I'd certainly been single long enough because there was an age difference between us. And, 'What's taken me so long?'" Diaz told People.com. "And my answer was, honestly, that I hadn't met the girl for me until Brittany.""It felt like this is the person for me and the person I want to spend the rest of my life with," he added.The couple married at a ranch in California in September 2012 and went to Patagonia for their honeymoon because Maynard wanted an adventure."It was the best of both worlds," Diaz told People.com. "We'd go out to glaciers, go see nature, go for a hike and then come back and get pampered.""So I'd say we really did it right where we had a lot of what she wanted -- the outdoors, hiking and trekking and seeing the beautiful sights in nature -- but then we'd also come back to the hotel and relax."Maynard was diagnosed with brain cancer in January and doctors estimated she had only months to live. She and her family moved to Oregon so she could take advantage of the state's assisted suicide laws, and Maynard quickly became an advocate for death with dignity. Her plight went viral when she teamed up with the nonprofit Compassion and Choices to fight for new laws and began blogging about her final days, checking off "bucket list" items like a Grand Canyon trip.
http://sports.yahoo.com/news/red-sox-sign-2-soon-3d-pitchers-rotation-222944771--mlb.html	Red Sox pick up 3 starters for rotation	BOSTON (AP) -- Just like that, the Boston Red Sox have a starting rotation again.One day after acquiring a pair of starters, the Red Sox picked up a third, rebuilding their starting rotation this offseason almost as quickly as they took it apart during the summer.Hours after trading for Detroit right-hander Rick Porcello on Thursday, Boston signed righty Justin Masterson as a free agent. On Friday, the Red Sox acquired lefty Wade Miley from Arizona for righties Rubby De La Rosa and Allen Webster and infielder Raymel Flores.''We're in a position where everyone knows we need to add quality starting pitching,'' general manager Ben Cherington told reporters on the team's second conference call of the night. ''We've been able to acquire the three starters we have this week while really being able to maintain the top end of our young pitching.''The Red Sox won the World Series in 2013 with a rotation that included Jon Lester, John Lackey, Jake Peavy and Felix Doubront. By midsummer it was obvious the team would not successfully defend its title in '14, and Cherington traded them all away to start planning for the future.Lester, who spent his entire career in the Red Sox organization until he was shipped to Oakland at the trading deadline, was courted to return as a free agent. But when the Chicago Cubs outbid Boston for the 31-year-old lefty, Cherington quickly executed a backup plan.Now, Masterson, Porcello and Miley will join holdover Clay Buchholz and one of Boston's young arms - perhaps Anthony Ranaudo or Brandon Workman - in a rotation that is so far lacking an ace.Masterson isn't sure they need one.''I think we have an incredible staff,'' he said on the first call. ''We've all had a bit of success, and I think ... we'll continue to do that.''An all-star in 2012, Miley was the Diamondbacks' opening day starter last season and went on to lead the team with 183 strikeouts and 201 1-3 innings pitched while posting an 8-12 record and 4.34 ERA. In four major league seasons, the 28-year-old lefty is 38-35 with a 4.34 ERA.The trade was a second salary-saving move for Arizona following the deal that sent catcher Miguel Montero to the Chicago Cubs. General manager Dave Stewart said he expects De La Rosa and Webster to be in the rotation. De La Rosa was 4-8 with a 4.43 ERA in 19 games for Boston last season. Webster was 5-3 with a 5.03 ERA in 11 starts for the Red Sox last year.Stewart told reporters in a conference call that the Diamondbacks were mulling whether to pursue high-priced pitchers James Shields and Max Scherzer.Masterson came up in the Red Sox system and spent part of two seasons in Boston before he was traded to Cleveland. He spent four more seasons there before he was sent to the St. Louis Cardinals this summer at the trading deadline.Although he has a 60-72 career record and a 4.24 ERA, Cherington said he was one of the best pitchers in the AL in 2011 and 2013. This season, he had a 5.88 ERA and spent time on the disabled list with right knee inflammation.''We're very confident that whatever physical issues affected him in 2014 will be behind him,'' Cherington said.Cherington confirmed that Masterson, who bounced in and out of the bullpen during his first Boston stint, is slotted for the rotation this time around.But the pitcher said he knew that was something less than a guarantee.''The assurance was that if I pitch the way I'm supposed to, I will be a starter,'' he said. ''If I'm not, the decision will be made. And I won't be happy anyway.''NOTES: In a separate trade Friday, Boston obtained Zeke Spruill from the Diamondbacks for Myles Smith in a swap of right-handers. ... According to Major League Baseball, the eight All-Stars traded at the winter meetings were the most since at least 1998. That does not include Miley, whose deal wasn't announced until the meetings were over.
http://news.yahoo.com/13-old-girl-father-gave-boko-haram-095332454.html	13-year-old girl: My father gave me to Boko Haram	KANO, Nigeria (AP) — A 13-year-old says her father gave her to Boko Haram extremists and that she was arrested after refusing to explode a suicide bomb in Kano, Nigeria's second largest city in the north.Nigeria has suffered numerous suicide bombings in recent months carried out by girls and young women. That has raised fears that the insurgents are using kidnapped girls.The girl told a news conference Wednesday night that she saw many people being buried alive at the Boko Haram camp where her father took her in Bauchi state, east of Kano.She said her captors asked if she wanted to go to paradise and, when she said yes, explained she would have to be a suicide bomber."When I was told I would have to die to enter paradise, that I would have to explode a bomb and die, I said I cannot do it," she said.When they threatened to kill her, she allowed them to strap her into a vest primed with explosives, saying "I was afraid to be buried alive."Two other girls detonated their bombs at Kano's textile market on Dec. 10. Police said the attack killed four people and wounded seven, including the girl.The West African nation's home-grown Boko Haram group attracted international condemnation when its fighters kidnapped 276 schoolgirls from a boarding school in northeast Chibok town in April. Dozens escaped but 219 remain missing.Thousands of people have been killed and 1.6 million driven from their homes in the 5-year-old uprising to create an Islamic state in Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation of 160 million people divided between mainly Muslims in the north and Christians in the south.Police Superintendent Adenrele Shinaba said the girl was arrested in the hospital with a leg wound. A taxi driver took her to the hospital, and she said she left her suicide vest on the seat. The driver alerted police.Shinaba said she will remain in custody while investigations continue. He said they had been unable to find her father, who the girl said belongs to Boko Haram.
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/10/17/yellen-greatly-concerned-by-widening-inequality/20980277/	Yellen: Greatly concerned by widening inequality	WASHINGTON (AP) - Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen sounded an alarm Friday about widening economic inequality in the United States, suggesting that America's longstanding identity as a land of opportunity was at stake.The growing gap between the rich and everyone else narrowed slightly during the Great Recession but has since accelerated, Yellen said in a speech at a conference in Boston on economic opportunity. And robust stock market returns during the recovery helped the wealthy outpace middle-class America in wages, employment and home prices."The extent and continuing increase in inequality in the United States greatly concerns me," Yellen said. "By some estimates, income and wealth inequality are near their highest levels in the past hundred years."Yellen's extensive comments on economic inequality marked an unusual public departure for a Fed chair. Her predecessors as head of the U.S. central bank tended to focus exclusively on the core Fed issues of interest rates, inflation and unemployment. Indeed, the Fed's mandate doesn't explicitly include issues like income or wealth disparities.But since taking over from Ben Bernanke in February, Yellen has made clear she is deeply concerned about the financial challenges that ordinary workers and families face.Throughout this year, she has stressed the need for the Fed to keep rates low to boost economic expansion and hiring. She has said that the unemployment rate, now at 5.9 percent, doesn't fully reflect the health of the job market: Yellen has expressed concern, for example, about stagnant incomes, the number of part-time workers who want full-time jobs and the many people who have given up their job searches and are no longer counted as unemployed.In her first speech as Fed chair, she highlighted the hurdles faced by three unemployed workers. And in congressional testimony in February, Yellen called income inequality "one of the most disturbing trends facing the nation."Her remarks Friday, accompanied by extensive data compiled by her staff, expanded on her concerns. Between 1989 and 2013, Yellen noted, the average income of the top 5 percent of households rose 38 percent. For the remaining 95 percent of households, it grew less than 10 percent.The widening gap in overall wealth is even more pronounced. The average net worth of the bottom 50 percent of families - a group of about 62 million households - was $11,000 in 2013, Yellen said. Adjusted for inflation, that figure is 50 percent lower than in 1989.By contrast, the average real net worth of families in the country's top 5 percent has jumped from $3.6 million in 1989 to $6.8 million in 2013, according to the Fed's data - an 89 percent surge."I think it is appropriate to ask whether this trend is compatible with values rooted in our nation's history, among them the high value Americans have traditionally placed on equality of opportunity," said Yellen, a labor economist.Many analysts argue that widening income inequality is hurting economic growth itself. The wealthy are receiving higher pay and rising investment earnings. Yet those households tend to spend less of their money than do low- and middle-income consumers who are dealing with sluggish wage growth. Because consumer spending accounts for roughly 70 percent of U.S. economic activity, less spending tends to slow growth.Yellen did not discuss the state of the economy, interest-rate policy or how her views might affect the Fed's actions. Nor did she address criticism that the Fed's super-low rates have helped sustain the wealth gap by fueling stock gains and facilitating mortgage refinancings. The affluent benefit disproportionately from stock-price increases and home refinancings.Instead, Yellen outlined four areas she described as "building blocks of opportunity" - early childhood education, affordable higher education, business ownership and inheritances."I do not mean to suggest that they account for all economic opportunity, but I do believe they are all significant sources opportunity for individuals and their families to improve their economic circumstances," Yellen said.On Thursday, she visited a career center in Chelsea, Massachusetts to meet with people looking for work.At the Chelsea center, Yellen listened to participants' stories about the job search difficulties they faced.The Fed will next meet Oct. 28-29. It is expected to end the monthly bond purchases it has been pursuing to put downward pressure on long-term rates. But it's also expected to retain language that it plans to keep a key short-term rate at a record low for a "considerable time."Most economists don't think the Fed will start raising short-term rates before mid-2015.- Fla. man sentenced in loud music killing- Bono reveals why he wears trademark sunglasses- Brazilian authorities arrest hospital worker suspected in dozens of killings

Instantly, even without knowing who's singing, that voice stands out — Rihanna.The pop star put out an album every year for seven years, then — without warning — took two years off. She didn't release an album. Her only single in 2014 was a duet with Shakira, "Can't Remember to Forget You." (Granted, that song was very popular.) In 2013, her only song was "Monster" with Eminem.Rumors of a Rihanna album dropping sometime in 2015 have been circulating since early fall, and here — just two days into the new year — a song that sounds like it just might be a new Rihanna track has appeared."World Peace" isn't as lyrically heavy as "Stay" or as perfect for clubs as "We Found Love," but it's nice to have Rihanna's unmistakable voice back anyway. Happy 2015, everyone!

http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/575830/20141213/russia-china-type-1130-ciws-mach-4.org	Russia Warns China Has New Type 1130 CIWS, Can Destroy 90% Mach 4 Hypersonic Missiles	China has developed a new close-in weapon system, or CIWS, called Type 1130, which has the firing power of 10,000 rounds per minute, portal Want China Times said, citing Russia media sources. The particular CIWS model, recently spotted being installed on a PLA Type 054A frigate, can reportedly destroy 90 percent of hypersonic missiles even travelling four times the speed of sound.CIWS, a point-defense weapon, is used to detect and counter short-range incoming missiles as well as enemy aircraft. It is typically mounted on warships.The Type 1130's Gatling-type gun, according to Want China Times, possess a 30 mm caliber. Its number of barrels were 11. Compared to its seven-barreled Type 730 predecessor, which only has one magazine of 250 rounds, Type 1130 carries two magazines. Each reportedly contains 640 rounds. The improved design and technology thus will enable China to fire more than 10,000 rounds per minute, with a chance of hit rate placed at 90 percent against Mach 4 missiles.The massive CIWS has reportedly been installed on both sides of the Liaoning, China's first aircraft carrier. The Liaoning, which entered its second year of service with the People's Liberation Army Navy, even has a ski-jump ramp.Citing Russian media, Want China Times said the Type 1130 CIWS will be deployed on the Type 055, the country's latest guided missile destroyer, very soon. It added theType 1130 CIWS will likely be placed on ships with a 12,000-ton displacement because of its gigantic size and weight, as well as the amount of electricity it will gobble up.Early in 2014, reports flaunted that Russia was seeking to strengthen ties with China, following the annexation of Crimea. In fact, Russian President Vladimir Putin approved in March to sell S-400 Triumf to China. Sales of Russians arms don't get immediately approved, unless consented by the president himself. Apart from the S-400 Triumf, the two countries are also negotiating for the sale of the S-400 anti-aircraft weapon system and Sukhoi Su-35.Moreover, China is fast tracking the completion of its aircraft carrier, a Type 001A, within just six years. The second domestic aircraft carrier, according to the Kanwa Defense Review magazine, will be fitted with four catapults and three escalators on board.To contact the editor, e-mail:
http://news.yahoo.com/4-northern-california-faults-primed-big-quakes-210209678.html	4 Northern California faults primed for big quakes	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Three fault segments running beneath Northern California and its roughly 15 million people are overdue for a major earthquake, including one section that lies near the dams and canals that supply much of the state's water, according to a geological study published Monday.The three fault segments and one other in the region are loaded with enough tension to produce quakes of magnitude 6.8 or greater, according to a geological study published Monday.They include the little-known Green Valley fault, which lies near key dams and aqueducts northeast of San Francisco. Underestimated by geologists until now, the fault running between the cities of Napa and Fairfield is primed for a magnitude-7.1 quake, according to researchers from the U.S. Geological Survey and San Francisco State University.The water supplies of the San Francisco Bay Area, Southern California and the farm-rich Central Valley depend on the man-made water system that links to the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers, noted James Lienkaemper, the U.S. Geological Survey geologist who was lead author of the study. The Green Valley fault is last believed to have ruptured sometime in the 1600s.The study shows the state "needs to consider more seriously" the earthquake risk in that area, Lienkaemper said by phone.All four vulnerable fault segments belong to the San Andreas fault system, the geological dividing line that marks where the western half of California shifts northwest and away from the rest of North America at about 2 inches a year.View gallery FILE - This file photo from Aug. 24, 2014, shows a cracked section of roadway following an earthquak …The other fault sections that have built up enough tension for a temblor with a magnitude of 6.8 or greater are the northern Calaveras and Hayward faults in the east San Francisco Bay Area and the Rodgers Creek fault to the north, scientists concluded in a study published in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America.Geologists reached their conclusions partly through regular data readings that geologists and San Francisco State University geology students began in 1979 along fault lines. The tracking now features annual readings at 80 monitoring sites at 29 sections of faults in northern California.The surveys measure fault creep, movements of fractions of inches that slowly release strain on some faults. When no fault creep is recorded, a fault is considered locked, and stress builds until an earthquake unlocks it.Roughly two-thirds of the 1,250 miles that comprise the five major branches of the San Andreas fault feature fault creep, the study concludes.Northern California recorded its biggest earthquake of a quarter-century Aug. 24, when a magnitude-6.0 quake hit Napa, north of San Francisco. Seismologists estimate seven quakes of 7.3 magnitude or more have hit California just since the 1800s, most of them when the state's population was a fraction of what it is now.
http://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Health-Benefits-Giving-Up-Dairy-35694882	6 Things That Happened When I Gave Up Dairy	In my 20s, I was a french-fry, soy-ice-cream, pasta-and-bread-loving vegan. I ended up gaining 40 pounds and — surprise, surprise — always felt tired, foggy-headed, and on the brink of another cold. After six years, I started eating eggs and dairy, and I felt a little better, but that's probably because I was finally eating healthier, trying to lose all the weight I gained.Fast forward 12 years to this Summer. I was sitting on my couch, flipping through Netflix, and stumbled upon the documentary Vegucated. It takes the stance that being vegan is better for the planet and kinder to animals, and after seeing some heartbreaking video footage, I felt compelled to eat more compassionately and ditch dairy on the spot. I had no idea how dramatically my life was about to improve.Wait, Are These My Skinny Jeans?Getting dressed one chilly September morning, I grabbed a pair of my favorite skinny jeans and they slipped right on! Since I tend to gain a little weight in the Summer, I was expecting to have to wrestle with them for a bit, but they didn't feel tight whatsoever. I even slipped them off to check the label to make sure they were the right pair. Yeah, you bet I was smiling and feeling pretty awesome. Since having two kids, I'd been carrying around a few extra pounds that were holding on for dear life (really, my youngest is now 2!), and ditching dairy made it happen in two months without any other change.Bye-Bye BloatKnow what the number one reason was for my Costco membership? Lactaid pills. Yep, I popped one every time I ate because even the tiniest drop of butter in a cracker could set me off. I wasn't always lactose intolerant, but it hit me hard when I went away to college, which was one of the reasons I went vegan back then. I couldn't leave my house without some trusty pills in my pocket, and I popped at least five a day. My body was telling me not to eat dairy and here I was devouring it every chance I got. And boy, did I pay the price. My belly was constantly bloated and I had more than my fair share of emergency bathroom runs. It seems obvious to anyone that you should stop eating the one thing that makes you feel horrible, but I guess I didn't realize just how bad I was feeling until I started feeling amazing.What's That Amazing Smell?Sinus surgery. That was the recommendation after years of chronic and painful sinus infections, extensive allergy testing, two CT scans, daily nasal sprays and antihistamines, twice-daily dates with my Neti Pot, months of heavy-duty antibiotics, and heartbreakingly having to find a new home for my two cats. The ear, nose, and throat specialist said it was one of the worst cases he'd seen, and said surgery to remove the congestion and widen my sinuses should be the next step. Talk about scared. There had to be another solution.I'd heard that dairy can contribute to congestion but considered not being able to breathe or smell a fair trade for cheese. It's been two months of being dairy free, and now that Fall is in full swing, I should be miserable with allergy stuffiness and sinus pressure. But I'm not. My doctor can't believe I haven't needed to refill my meds. I even went apple picking and could actually smell the cider donuts cooking (not that I could eat one!). I teared up. I had a moment right there in the apple orchard. And to think, I almost went through with surgery, when all I needed to do was say no to cheese.Did You Change Moisturizers?Seriously, someone asked me this, and I was thrilled. My skin has never been clearer. I didn't have a bad acne problem, but a pimple always seemed to be cropping up, which was pretty embarrassing for someone in their late 30s. My skin is smoother, softer, and has more of a natural glow. It makes sense, since cow's milk contains growth hormone, fats, and sugars (yes, organic milk, too), which can aggravate the skin. There's definitely some strong data showing the correlation between dairy and acne, and although it can take up to six months for skin to heal, I noticed a difference within a month.Smoothies, Salads, and Sweet PotatoesLike most people, I tried to eat healthy, but when you're in a rush or tired from a long day, you grab the quickest thing. As a vegetarian, cheese was like its own food group to me, and admittedly, cheesy pesto paninis, creamy pasta, and pizza were always on the menu. I had to completely rethink my meals and found that with a little bit of prep, I was eating so much healthier. I made green smoothies for breakfast, salads for lunch, and got really creative with using tempeh, tofu, lentils, beans, whole grains, and all sorts of veggies. Ditching dairy meant that I made room for foods that were much more nutrient-packed, and I no longer felt heavy after meals.Another Three Miles? Sure!Eating healthier also meant I had more energy. Whether it was going for a run, bike ride, hike, or teaching a yoga class, I felt so peppy and fired up. I had more days in the past two months where I felt like I could keep going and going than I ever had when I was eating dairy. Maybe this is the reason so many athletes go vegan.Final ThoughtsI know what you're thinking. "I could never live without __________." So don't. If you want to avoid dairy but you could never give up pizza, then give up dairy except for pizza. I will say that for most of your favorite foods there are some pretty outstanding alternatives. My kitchen is constantly stocked with soy milk, soy yogurt, Earth Balance buttery spread, and my fave — almond milk ice cream. Personally, I wasn't a fan of vegan cheeses so I just leave it off my pizza or sandwiches, or make my own using raw cashews. Please don't mourn for the cookies and pancakes you can't eat. There are so many dairy-free recipes that taste as awesome as ones containing milk and butter. Once you get used to cooking and eating in this new way, it'll feel just as easy as your diet feels now. If you can't go cold turkey, do what you can and gradually take milk out of your diet. If your experience is anything like mine, the benefits will speak for themselves, and you'll be inspired to eliminate dairy completely.For more tips on going dairy-free, check out: Tasty Breakfasts Minus the Dairy Picking the Best Dairy-Free Milk For You Decadent Desserts That Are Dairy-Free
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/11/14/republican-controlled-house-passed-legislation-approving-the-key/20993928/	Republican-controlled House passes legislation approving the Keystone XL oil pipeline	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress inched closer Friday to a possible showdown with President Barack Obama over the Keystone XL oil pipeline as the Republican-controlled House approved the project. Supporters in the Democratic-run Senate predicted they will get the 60 votes needed to pass it next week.The House vote was 252-161 in favor of the bill, which was sponsored by Rep. Bill Cassidy, R-La., in an effort to boost his chances to take a Louisiana Senate seat away from Democrat Mary Landrieu. The two are headed for a Dec. 6 runoff and have been touting their energy credentials in the oil and gas-producing state.Should the Senate send the bill to Obama for his signature, he would face a decision that pits some of his environmental concerns about the pipeline, mainly its consequences for global warming, against potentially helping a fellow Democrat making a longshot bid to retain her Senate seat.The House bill was supported by 221 Republicans, with not a single GOP lawmaker voting against it. Thirty-one Democrats backed the bill, while 161 rejected it."This will make it easier for the Senate to do right by the American people and finally vote on building the pipeline," Cassidy said in a statement after the vote.The bill's passage marked the ninth time the House had passed a bill to speed up the pipeline's construction.Landrieu pushed the Senate to hold its upcoming vote on the measure. In a call with reporters from Louisiana, where she was campaigning, Landrieu called herself the "sparkplug" to get the Keystone bill through Congress. The House bill is identical to one introduced by Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., and Landrieu in May."This bill was drafted to go the distance," said Landrieu.As of Friday, supporters of the measure appeared to have at least 59 of the 60 Senate votes they would need for approval next week. That included all 45 Republicans and 14 Democrats.Landrieu conceded, though, that it is unlikely the Senate or House will have the two-thirds majorities that would be needed to override an Obama veto of the bill. She said she did not know Obama's plans."He most certainly understands my position," Landrieu said. "He understands that there are 15-plus Democrats in the Senate that really want to build the Keystone pipeline."If the bill fails to pass the Senate next week, Hoeven said he would reintroduce it next year when Republicans will control the chamber. That would make it one of many showdowns expected with Obama over energy and environmental policy after Republicans take full control of Congress in January.The $8 billion pipeline has become a symbol for the divisions on the country's energy and environmental policy. Environmentalists have framed the issue as a significant test of Obama's commitment to address climate change. Republicans and other supporters say it is necessary for jobs and energy security, because the U.S. would be importing oil from its neighbor, not the Middle East. Still others have criticized the project because some of the product refined from the oil could be exported to other countries, instead of used here.The project has been stalled by environmental reviews, by objections to the route it would take and by politics for six years. While the White House has issued veto threats on similar legislation before, it had yet to formally do so Friday.House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said it was time for Obama to listen to the American people, especially after Republican gains in last week's midterm elections, and sign the bill."The president doesn't have any more elections to win, and he has no other excuse for standing in the way," Boehner said.Obama, questioned about the issue while traveling on the other side of the globe, said the administration's long-stalled review of the project cannot be completed before knowing the outcome of a legal challenge to the pipeline's route through Nebraska. He also reiterated that he will ultimately judge the project on its impact on climate change and energy prices."I have to constantly push back against this idea that somehow the Keystone pipeline is either this massive jobs bill for the United States, or is somehow lowering gas prices," Obama said. "Understand what this project is. It is providing the ability of Canada to pump their oil, send it through our land, down to the Gulf, where it will be sold everywhere else. That doesn't have an impact on U.S. gas prices."The State Department said in a Jan. 31 report that the project would not significantly boost carbon emissions because the oil was likely to find its way to market by other means. It added that transporting it by rail or truck would cause greater environmental problems than if the Keystone XL pipeline were built.The 1,179-mile project is proposed to go from Canada through Montana and South Dakota to Nebraska, where it would connect with existing pipelines to carry more than 800,000 barrels of crude oil a day to refineries along the Texas Gulf Coast.---Eds: AP Special Correspondent David Espo contributed to this report.
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/11/02/un-climate-report-offers-stark-warnings-hope/20987374/	UN climate report offers stark warnings, hope	COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) - Climate change is happening, it's almost entirely man's fault and limiting its impacts may require reducing greenhouse gas emissions to zero this century, the U.N.'s panel on climate science said Sunday.The fourth and final volume of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's giant climate assessment didn't offer any surprises, nor was it expected to since it combined the findings of three earlier reports released in the past 13 months.But it underlined the scope of the climate challenge in stark terms. Emissions, mainly from the burning of fossil fuels, may need to drop to zero by the end of this century for the world to have a decent chance of keeping the temperature rise below a level that many consider dangerous. Failure to do so, which could require deployment of technologies that suck greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere, could lock the world on a trajectory with "irreversible" impacts on people and the environment, the report said. Some impacts are already being observed, including rising sea levels, a warmer and more acidic ocean, melting glaciers and Arctic sea ice and more frequent and intense heat waves."Science has spoken. There is no ambiguity in their message. Leaders must act. Time is not on our side," U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the report's launch in Copenhagen.Amid its grim projections, the report also offered hope. The tools needed to set the world on a low-emissions path are there; it just has to break its addiction to the oil, coal and gas that power the global energy system while polluting the atmosphere with heat-trapping CO2, the chief greenhouse gas."We have the means to limit climate change," IPCC chairman Rajendra Pachauri said. "All we need is the will to change, which we trust will be motivated by knowledge and an understanding of the science of climate change."The IPCC was set up in 1988 to assess global warming and its impacts. The report released Sunday caps its latest assessment, a mega-review of 30,000 climate change studies that establishes with 95-percent certainty that nearly all warming seen since the 1950s is man-made.Today only a small minority of scientists challenge the mainstream conclusion that climate change is linked to human activity.Sleep-deprived delegates approved the final documents Saturday afternoon after a weeklong line-by-line review in Copenhagen that underscored that the IPCC process is not just about science. The reports must be approved both by scientists and governments, which means political issues from U.N. climate negotiations, which are nearing a 2015 deadline for a global agreement, inevitably affect the outcome.The rift between developed and developing countries in the U.N. talks opened up in Copenhagen over a box of text that discussed what levels of warming could be considered dangerous. After a protracted battle, the delegates couldn't agree on the wording, and the box was dropped from a key summary for policy-makers to the disappointment of some scientists."If the governments are going to expect the IPCC to do their job," said Princeton professor Michael Oppenheimer, a lead author of the IPCC's second report, they shouldn't "get caught up in fights that have nothing to do with the IPCC."The omission of the box meant the word "dangerous" disappeared from the summary altogether. It appeared only twice in a longer underlying report compared to seven times in a draft produced before the Copenhagen session.But the less loaded word "risk" was mentioned 65 times in the final 40-page summary."Rising rates and magnitudes of warming and other changes in the climate system, accompanied by ocean acidification, increase the risk of severe, pervasive, and in some cases irreversible detrimental impacts," the report said.World governments in 2009 set a goal of keeping the temperature rise below 2 degrees C (3.6 F) compared to before the industrial revolution. Temperatures have gone up about 0.8 C (1.4 F) since the 19th century.Meanwhile, emissions have risen so fast in recent years that the world has already used up two-thirds of its carbon budget, the maximum amount of CO2 that can be emitted to have a likely chance of avoiding 2 degrees of warming, the IPCC report said."This report makes it clear that if you are serious about the 2-degree goal ... there is nowhere to hide," said Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists, an advocacy group. "You can't wait several decades to address this issue."U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called the report "another canary in the coal mine.""The bottom line is that our planet is warming due to human actions, the damage is already visible, and the challenge requires ambitious, decisive and immediate action," Kerry said in a statement. "Those who choose to ignore or dispute the science so clearly laid out in this report do so at great risk for all of us and for our kids and grandkids."Pointing to the solution, the IPCC said the costs associated with mitigation action such as shifting the energy system to solar and wind power and other renewable sources and improving energy efficiency would reduce economic growth only by 0.06 percent annually.And Pachauri said that cost should be measured against the implications of doing nothing, putting "all species that live on this planet" at peril.The report is meant as a scientific roadmap for the U.N. climate negotiations, which continue next month in Lima, Peru. That's the last major conference before a summit in Paris next year, where a global agreement on climate action is supposed to be adopted."Lima should be the place where we put the pieces together so we can move toward success" in Paris, said Peruvian Environment Minister Manuel Pulgar-Vidal.The biggest hurdle is deciding who should do what, with rich countries calling on China and other major developing countries to take on ambitious targets, and developing countries saying the rich have a historical responsibility to lead the fight against warming and to help poorer nations cope with its impacts. The IPCC carefully avoided taking sides in that discussion, saying the risks of climate change "are generally greater for disadvantaged people and communities in countries at all levels of development."

Parachin for YourTango.comOver lunch with a friend one day, Kevin was asked about the "secret of your obviously happy and healthy love relationship."Kevin responded, "I married a wonderful woman and made the commitment to apply myself to the relationship with the same energy that I place into other important areas of my life: school, work, health, friendships. I didn't want to be casual about the relationship nor take it for granted. My partner has pretty much done the same thing. Consequently, we make a great team. I can't imagine being without her."Highly successful couples like Kevin and his wife know that making the relationship a top priority is vital. They don't allow it to derail. They know the ingredients that are necessary to keep each other content, happy, healthy and satisfied. To put it simply, philosopher Paul Tillich observed, "Any deep relationship to another human being requires watchfulness and nourishment."So listen up: Here are the 10 secrets of highly successful couples:1. Successful couples enjoy each other. It's just that simple. They like to be together, talk together, do things together. Former Beatle Ringo Starr has been married to his wife Barbara for more than three decades. He says the "secret" to the couple's longevity is this: "I'm just blessed that she puts up with me. I love the woman. She loves me. There are less down days than up, and we get on really well. We spend a lot of time together. That's the deal."2. Successful couples fight skillfully. "In conflict, be fair and generous," is wisdom from The Tao. When two people live together, they are bound to have differences of opinion and disagreements. Successful couples fight but do it skillfully; in a way that leaves the relationship stronger, not weaker. One technique they employ is their choice of words. For example, University of California (Berkeley) researchers looked at "connected" couples and discovered that they tend to use plural pronouns ("we", "us" and "ours") rather than singular pronouns ("I", "me" and "mine"). As a result, they were less likely to feel stressed out after the disagreement than couples who used singular pronouns. "Using 'we language' during a fight helps couples align themselves on the same team, as opposed to being adversaries," notes lead author Benjamin Seider.3. Successful couples seek and offer forgiveness. They may not forgive and forget, but they do forgive and let it go. When they have done something wrong or hurtful, they offer an apology. When they are the wronged party, they accept the gift of an apology. Successful couples travel the pathway toward forgiving, which is outlined by author Clarissa Pinkola Estes, who cites these four stages for arrival at complete forgiveness:-- Forgo: Take a break from thinking about the person or event for a while.-- Forebear: Abstain from punishing, neither thinking about it nor acting on (the offense) in small or large ways. Give a bit of grace to the situation.-- Forget: Refuse to dwell; let go and loosen one's hold, particularly on memory. To forget is an active -- not passive -- endeavor.-- Forgive: Make a conscious decision to cease to harbor resentment, which includes forgiving a debt and giving up one's resolve to retaliate.4. Successful couples are in it for the long haul. "There are only two options regarding commitment. You're either in or you're out. There's no such thing as life in between," says professional basketball coach Pat Riley. Successful couples don't just make promises to each other; they commit. After a marriage that spans 30 years, a couple named Doris and Jim say, "We are happy together because we have lived out our vows -- for richer, for poorer, for better, for worse, in sickness and in health." When Doris was in a serious auto accident a few years ago she remembers that "Jim was there all the way. He's an incredible husband, the most selfless person. He's the only person in the world I know I can count on."5. Successful couples are positive about each other. Marriage researcher John Gottman, Ph.D, says happy couples have relationships "characterized by respect, affection and empathy, and they pay close attention to what's happening in each other's lives." Furthermore, his research reveals that happy and stable couples "made five positive remarks for every one negative remark when they were discussing conflict. In contrast, couples headed for divorce offered less than one positive remark for every single negative remark."6. Successful couples learn and grow together. One couple, after being married for 30 years, decided they would both return to university for master's degrees in liberal arts. "It took us nearly five years. We had a great time being in class together, studying together, reading together. The program allowed us to expand our horizons as we took courses in religion, politics, literature, history, foreign policy. We even persuaded one professor to let us write a paper together: joint authors!" Partners in successful couples play to each other's strengths and interests. If one partner becomes more health conscious, the other joins. If one partner takes up a new activity, the other partner becomes supportive and involved. The end result is a stronger emotional bond and a deeper love.7. Successful couples never stop dating. That was one of the "secrets" of a happy relationship uncovered by Matthew Boggs and Jason Miller. The duo traveled over 12,000 miles searching and interviewing people they called "marriage masters" -- those married 40 years or more. One common element to many marriage masters was their ability to keep the romance going. Some set aside one evening a week for a date, others planned romantic getaways periodically, while others still met most afternoons for conversation at a coffee or tea shop.8. Successful couples bring each other joy. In his book, The Real Rules of Life: Balancing Life's Terms with Your Own, Ken Druck, Ph.D, tells about a workshop he gave to his wife as a birthday gift. "She had a beautiful voice that she rarely used. What better gift than to unleash the joy she already possessed." In the workshop, participants of every age and background were encouraged to "vanquish the wagging finger of self-condemnation and sing their hearts out." The workshop high point was a live concert for family and friends. "With the exception of our children's births, I can never recall my wife as having been so joyful and happy."9. Successful couples adhere to the 60/40 rule. Boggs and Miller also discovered that "marriage masters" have a high level of selflessness. "Walter" whom they interviewed, told them, "I'll never forget what my mentor told my wife and me before we got married 42 years ago. He looked at us and said, 'Most people think marriage is 50/50. It's not. It's 60/40. You give 60. You take 40. And that goes for both of you." It was a principle Walter and his wife adhered to faithfully.10. Successful couples have shared values. When asked about her successful relationship of 58 years, "Emma," age 87, smiled and proudly said, "It is quite an achievement. It's important to have the same basic values. In other words, if you're a free spender, marry someone who understands that. If you're frugal, you need to marry someone who understands that because money is one of the stumbling blocks in marriage. Fortunately, we had the same values on most things. We usually had the same goals -- we believed in education; we wanted to be moral; we wanted to raise children to be good citizens and to be responsible in terms of finances."Poet Robert Browning put the secret to successful couples in a nutshell when he wrote, "Success in marriage is more than finding the right person: It is being the right person."More Stories From YourTango:7 Most Surprising Things About Marriage5 Rules To Keep Technology From Ruining Your RelationshipWhat Did Blake Lively Reveal About Life With Ryan Reynolds?12 Scandalous Love Letters From Famous PeopleLove: Tips & Expert AdviceKeep in touch!

http://news.yahoo.com/ny-couple-complained-neighbor-much-were-arrested-135538845--abc-news-topstories.html	NY Couple Complained About Neighbor So Much They Were Arrested	A Cooperstown, New York, couple, who often complained about their neighbor to a district attorney, were taken by surprise when charges were filed against them.Paul Sohacki and Katherine Gannon live on 12 scenic acres in Otsego County, New York. They say their neighbor Gene Ellis, who lives on more than 50 acres, attempted to steal their land. It all started, the couple recalls, because Ellis’ driveway crossed a sliver of their land.“He never asked permission. He said, ‘You’re not going to prevent us from driving on this driveway,’” Gannon told ABC News’ “20/20.”“He was redefining the border closer and closer to our house. We had to get the land surveyed and see who owned what,” Sohacki told “20/20.”Watch the full story on ABC News' "20/20" on Friday, Jan. 2 at 10 p.m. ET.Ellis declined a request from “20/20” for an interview.Gannon and Sohacki sued, and then settled. Ellis agreed to move his driveway off of their property. But Sohacki and Cannon kept their cameras rolling.The couple said that they had to film Ellis to document what they say was trespassing and menacing behavior. Soon cameras covered their property, and they supplemented their security cameras with cameras in their cars and carried cameras everywhere they went.“It was a reality show,” Sohacki said.Sohacki and Gannon took their videos to the County District Attorney, John Muehl, pressuring him to take action against Ellis.But the DA said Sohacki and Gannon’s videos were more revealing than they realized.“It showed them actually committing a crime against him. All of these videos [were] the best evidence against themselves,” Muehl told “20/20.”More than a year after that call the DA finally did something, but not the action Sohacki and Gannon expected.“They were eventually arrested when we actually had some independent evidence of a witness, who was able to confirm that the Sohackis were following Mr. Ellis around and taking pictures of him,” Muehl said.Sohacki and Gannon were charged with stalking their neighbor.“But really, if it hadn't been for this, Mr. Sohacki and Ms. Gannon bringing me the evidence against themselves, I wouldn’t have known, for sure, who to believe,” Muehl said. “But when I've got these videos where it’s clear that they are causing the issue.”The couple never spent any time in jail, and eventually the charges were dropped. It's proof, they say, that the DA misread their video evidence, and that the charges were trumped up, with the case built exclusively on statements from Ellis' friends and relatives."The DA was out to get me," Sohaki said. "The police were out to get me."The DA said that claim is incorrect.“I believe they are obsessed with Gene Ellis,” Muehl said.“[I’m] not obsessed, but it did take a lot of time. Because of the situation, we had to spend a lot of time documenting,” Gannon said.“It actually is very rational behavior if you were in the situation that we were in. It was the logical, smart thing to do to protect our family.”After the entire ordeal, Ellis moved. But Sohacki and Gannon are also moving, relocating for Sohacki’s work.“Without a doubt, it was definitely worth it. What it did, it actually ended up not being a fight about the land. It was more of a fight about justice,” Sohacki said.“The point was, there was a bully,” Gannon said.“That was the issue for us: always respectfully saying, ‘No, you can't do this to our family. It's not right. It's against the law. You can't do it.’”Watch the full story on ABC News' "20/20" on Friday, Jan. 2 at 10 p.m. ET.

https://www.yahoo.com/style/the-original-plus-size-model-returns-to-fashion-99922334193.html	The Original Plus Size Model Returns to Change The Fashion World	Getty ImagesAny child of the nineties remembers when Emme, the first plus size model, broke out onto the scene. In an era that heralded the arrival of Cindy, Naomi, Christy, and Linda, she was an anomaly but no less beautiful. Her column for Mode magazine, about the trials and tribulations of plus size fashion, earned her a spot on People Magazine’s “50 Most Beautiful People” list not once, but twice. Over the years, she went on to battle lymphoma (which began her quest for green living), and also hosted a dating reality show for FOX entitled More to Love. Today Emme is back in the news for continuing her quest to bring high fashion options to the wonderfully curvy women of the world. She recently went back to Syracuse University (her alma matter) to establish “Fashion Without Limits”—a design contest in which students are invited to create a red-carpet dress for Emme. The model, 51, sat down with WWD to discuss this new initiative and share her thoughts on the current state of the industry. Here are the highlights. On why designers are not paying attention to the full size market: Some 68 percent of the U.S. female population is size 12 and above. (about 108 million women). If you take 10 percent of that, it’s a pretty big market share. There’s a contemporary market and a young junior market that’s very big and not being addressed outside of mass. There are designers paying attention to it, [but] they’re just not the ones we see on a regular basis in the magazines. They’re not yet being funded fully or in department stores or opening their own stores.On which designers are doing it well:Designers that are in place and in the fold in the fashion industry — outside of Michael Michael Kors, which has expanded its business to plus size and is doing very well in that — [include] Lauren Ralph Lauren, who’s doing well. Jessica Simpson is not a designer, but she’s expanded into plus-size juniors and is doing very well at Macy’s. Calvin Klein is killing it — these are their better lines. I’m doing appearances with Macy’s this fall, and they have beautiful things you wouldn’t have seen 10 to 15 years ago.On how Europeans are more plus size friendly: It’s always been this way. With age and beauty, it’s much less under a microscope in Europe. They don’t Photoshop as intensely as we do in the U.S. I never noticed it was that bad, [but] you…start to travel and you look at the imagery over there. You’ll see fine lines, and you’ll see teeth not being overly white. You’ll see the natural essence of that woman coming out. You’ll see a little bit of age, and you’ll see women who are not size zero. You don’t see a lot of size-zero imagery in Europe.…On shopping for plus size clothing today: You can’t imagine how hard it is for me. I can’t go into most of the stores. I once took a camera crew with “20/20,” and [the shopkeepers] said, “You can go over to the basement of Bloomingdale’s or Macy’s at Herald Square.” They told me, point-blank, “No, we don’t have it here.” Even at the top of my career, I had designers making me one-offs. 
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/ex-goldman-trader-correctly-shorted-152002886.html	The Ex-Goldman Trader Who Correctly Shorted Subprime Mortgages During The Financial Crisis Has Made A New Bet	REUTERS/Jim Young Joshua Birnbaum, the former managing director of structured products group trading for Goldman Sachs. When Josh Birnbaum was at Goldman Sachs in 2007, he made a huge bet against subprime mortgages.Now he's betting against something else: high-yield bonds.From The Wall Street Journal:Joshua Birnbaum, the ex-Goldman Sachs Group Inc. trader who made bets against subprime mortgages during the financial crisis, now has more than $2 billion in wagers against high-yield bonds at his Tilden Park Capital Management LP hedge-fund firm, according to investor documents.On Monday, The Journal published a big report on the worries facing investors in the junk bond space amid the sharp decline in the price of oil. Bonds tied to the energy sector make up about 15% of the high-yield space. A few weeks ago, investment adviser Josh Brown wrote: "The question now is whether or not the slide in crude can do enough damage in the high yield market to set off a chain reaction of de-risking, default, and outflows."As The Journal reports, junk bonds this year have returned less than 1% after gains of about 7% last year and 15% in 2012. On Friday, the effective yield for high-yield bonds closed at multiyear highs, topping 7% and also topping the yield seen during the "taper tantrum" in spring 2013.A rise in bond yields implies that investors are worried about the ability of borrowers to repay their obligations. In the event of a default, those who hold junk bonds are often the first to take a "haircut" (in which they do not get the full value of their investment back).The rise in the yield for junk bonds also comes amid a rally, or decline, in the yield on Treasury bonds, as investors seek safety amid unsettled markets. Here's the crazy spike in high yield. FRED NOW WATCH: How Mark Cuban Paved The Way For Steve Ballmer's NBA Investment More From Business InsiderOil Trading 'God' Andrew Hall Is Reportedly Leaving Legendary Commodities Firm Phibro Oil Fights Back Crude Oil Is Crashing

http://www.voanews.com/content/us-navy-lab-turns-seawater-into-fuel/1919512.html	US Navy Lab Turns Seawater Into Fuel	For centuries, alchemists have tried to turn lead into gold. That transmutation has long been proven impossible, but another similar dream - turning water into fuel - seems to be achievable. Scientists at a U.S. Naval Laboratory proved it by flying a model airplane burning re-engineered seawater.Natural gas and liquid fuels, burned in all kinds of internal combustion engines, are chemical compounds of hydrogen and carbon, coming mostly from underground reserves.Oceans also are huge reservoirs of hydrogen, though, and - increasingly - carbon dioxide, or CO2. Dissolved in seawater from the air, it makes the water more acidic.Extracting those chemicals from the ocean and converting them into a form of liquid fuel was made possible by some recent technological advances, according to U.S. Navy researcher, Dr. Heather Willauer.“We've been actually able to show that we can recombine CO2 and hydrogen in the laboratory on a lab-scale, laboratory scale, into a liquid-type fuel,” she said.The process requires a lot of electrical energy, which - to be economical - has to come from a cheap source, such as a nuclear power plant.Economical electric energyObviously, the most efficient place to do it would be aboard a nuclear powered aircraft carrier. Willauer said these ships may someday manufacture their own jet fuel.“Well, it is a game-changer potentially for the Navy or commercial entities because you can make fuel potentially where and when you need it,” she said.The new fuel was tested successfully on a model airplane with a two-stroke engine. For now, making it requires twice as much power as the fuel can produce, but researchers hope to lower that ratio.Willauer said the new process will not increase the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which contributes to global warming.“Once we've pulled it out of seawater, the ocean is ready to pull it back in from the atmosphere, 'cause it's in constant equilibrium. So what we hope is it's a carbon-neutral footprint,” she said.Scientists hope a small scale industrial plant may start converting seawater into fuel within the next 15 years.
http://www.foxnews.com/leisure/2014/10/13/2016-chevrolet-camaro-caught-on-camera/	2016 Chevrolet Camaro caught on camera	Bumblebee from "Transformers: Age of Extinction" (Chevrolet)The 2016 Chevrolet Camaro has been hitting the town in disguise, but it’s instantly recognizable as one of this past summer’s biggest movie stars.The sixth-generation muscle machine was caught on camera undergoing testing at Germany’s Nurburgring racetrack by fan site Camaro6G.com. Despite its black and white camouflage paint, the overall styling of the new car can plainly be seen.From its slim grille and big mouth lower air intake to its wedge-shaped rocker panels and sharply-creased rear fenders, the final version of the high-performance coupe will undoubtedly production version of Bumblebee from “Transformers: Age of Extinction.”This is no surprise, as the fifth-generation 2010 Camaro was previewed by the Bumblebee used for the 2007 “Transformers” film, and GM worked closely with the latest installment’s producers to develop the characters based on GM products.Details on the new Camaro have still not been revealed, but it’s expected to be smaller and lighter than the current car. You can probably add “more powerful” to that list, too, if the roar coming out of the test car is any indication.No word yet on when the 2016 Camaro will officially debut, but keep an eye out for this road-going Autobot during the upcoming auto show season that kicks off in Los Angeles this November.

http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/02/25/worlds-oldest-cheese/5776373/	Great Gouda! World's oldest cheese found - on mummies	Remains discovered with mummies in China prove to be oldest known samples of cheese.Vintage Gouda may be aged for five years, some cheddar for a decade. They're both under-ripe youngsters compared with yellowish clumps – found on the necks and chests of Chinese mummies – now revealed to be the world's oldest cheese.The Chinese cheese dates back as early as 1615 BC, making it by far the most ancient ever discovered. Thanks to the quick decay of most dairy products, there isn't even a runner-up. The world's best-aged cheese seems to be a lactose-free variety that was quick and convenient to make and may have played a role in the spread of herding and dairying across Asia."We not only identified the product as the earliest known cheese, but we also have direct … evidence of ancient technology," says study author Andrej Shevchenko, an analytical chemist at Germany's Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics. The method was "easy, cheap … It's a technology for the common people."The cheese, like the mummies, owes its existence to the extraordinary conditions at Small River Cemetery Number 5, in northwestern China. First documented by a Swedish archaeologist in the 1930s, it sits in the fearsome Taklamakan Desert, one of the world's largest. A mysterious Bronze Age people buried dozens of their own atop a large sand dune near a now-dry river, interring their kin underneath what looks like large wooden boats. The boats were wrapped so snugly with cowhide that it's as if they'd been "vacuum-packed," Shevchenko says.The combination of dry desert air and salty soil prevented decay to an extraordinary degree. The remains and grave goods were freeze-dried, preserving the light-brown hair and strangely non-Asian facial features of the dead along with their felt hats, wool capes and leather boots. Analysis of the plant seeds and animal tissues in the tombs showed the burials date to 1450 to 1650 BC.Some of the bodies had oddly shaped crumbs on their necks and chests. By analyzing the proteins and fats in these clumps, Shevchenko and his colleagues determined that they're definitely cheese, not butter or milk. It's not clear why people were buried with bits of cheese on their bodies, Shevchenko says, though perhaps it was food for the afterlife.The analysis also showed the mummies' cheese was made by combining milk with a "starter," a mix of bacteria and yeast. This technique is still used today to make kefir, a sour, slightly effervescent dairy beverage, and kefir cheese, similar to cottage cheese.If the people of the cemetery did indeed rely on a kefir starter to make cheese, they were contradicting the conventional wisdom. Most cheese today is made not with a kefir starter but with rennet, a substance from the guts of a calf, lamb or kid that curdles milk. Cheese was supposedly invented by accident when humans began carrying milk in bags made of animal gut.Making cheese with rennet requires the killing of a young animal, Shevchenko points out, and the kefir method does not. He argues that the ease and low cost of the kefir method would have helped drive the spread of herding throughout Asia from its origins in the Middle East. Even better, both kefir and kefir cheese are low in lactose, making them edible for the lactose-intolerant inhabitants of Asia. The new results are reported in an upcoming issue of the Journal of Archaeological Science.Scientists have found fragments of cheese-making strainers in Poland that date back more than 7,000 years, and there are Danish pots from 5,000 years ago that hold what may be butter or cheese, says bioarchaeologist Oliver Craig of the University of York in Britain. But he agrees that Shevchenko's team has good evidence that their cheese is the record-holder for age.Craig is more cautious about the new study's suggestion that the cheese was made with kefir starter rather than rennet. That's harder to prove, he says, because the proteins could have decayed too much to provide a definitive answer. He thinks a study of animal bones or pottery is needed to confirm that the cheese at the cemetery was part of a technological spread across Asia.Whether the cheese was common in its day, it's exceptional now.

According to Metro, the guy wrote a quick note to the seemingly unaware guy about his pregnant girlfriend’s alleged actions. Apparently, the guy who wrote the letter was sitting behind the couple at the Detroit Lions’ game on Thanksgiving Day.That’s reportedly how he saw the “inappropriate text message conversation” between the woman and another guy. Sadly, her oblivious boyfriend was sitting right next to her without a clue. So the man behind them penned a letter to enlighten him. Then he reportedly shared about the encounter via Facebook! Of course, the jaw-dropping letter has since gone viral.Here’s the details from his Facebook post.“I was at the Detroit Lions game today when I noticed this woman who looks 8 months pregnant in a seat in front of me texting a man messages like ‘I wish I was with you all day’ and ‘I will see you as soon as I’m done with him,'” wrote the guy in a Facebook post. “She kept hiding her phone every time her partner put his arm around her or reached in to talk to her.”This is text from the infamous letter he wrote to the guy.“‘Hey bro, I don’t know you and you don’t know me. When you get home check your girl’s phone. She’s been texting ‘Jason’ saying she wishes she was with him all day!”A screenshot of the Facebook post was originally shared via Reddit. However, the identity of the man was not revealed. It is also unclear whether the couple is still together or not. FanSided also shared another perspective of the incident.

http://www.aol.com/article/2014/11/26/thanksgiving-travelers-contend-with-rain-snow/20999278/	East Coast storm snarls Thanksgiving travel	MINEOLA, N.Y. (AP) -- A sloppy mix of rain and snow rolled into the Northeast on Wednesday just as millions of Americans began the big Thanksgiving getaway, grounding hundreds of flights and turning highways hazardous along the congested Washington-to-Boston corridor.By early afternoon, more than 600 flights had been canceled, the bulk of them in the Northeast, during what is typically one of the busiest travel periods of the year. Thousands of flight delays were also expected as the snow from the nor'easter piled up.Some travelers tried to change their plans and catch earlier flights to beat the storm, and major airlines waived their re-booking fees. But most planes were already filled.Numerous auto accidents were reported across the Northeast, where by midafternoon the line between rain and snow ran roughly along Interstate 95, the chief route between Washington and Boston.Schools and businesses also closed in some areas, and state government offices let workers go home early.Pat Green and her husband drove from Saugerties, New York, to the Albany airport for the first leg of their trip to San Francisco. She said the drive on the New York State Thruway was "a little hairy," but they made it, and their flight was on schedule so far."It was snowing so hard you couldn't see the car ahead of you," she said. "We slowed down so we were fine. We also give ourselves a lot of extra time."Major Northeast cities were likely to see moderate to heavy rain most of the day, though New York could see 1 to 4 inches of snow, and its northern suburbs 6 to 8 inches, the National Weather Service said. Higher elevations west of the I-95 corridor could see as much as 6 to 12 inches.New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo activated the state's Emergency Operations Center and had 1,800 plow operators standing by to clear snow between New York City and Albany.Dan Albert hoped to beat the snow as he, his wife and 15-year-old daughter refueled their SUV Wednesday morning along I-81 in Hagerstown, Maryland, about halfway between their Greensboro, North Carolina, home and their Thanksgiving destination in Mahwah, New Jersey."Traffic was fine last night, no problems at all, but today's going to be a real booger," Albert said. But he added: "Got to see the folks. We only get to see them once a year. Got to muscle through it, right?"At a rest stop on the New Jersey Turnpike, tired families grabbed large cups of coffee and breakfasts of pizza and fried chicken before heading back to the slushy road.Abdullah Masud, a lawyer who lives in Kuwait, was heading from Boston to Washington with a cousin."We were originally planning on leaving Wednesday morning, but when we heard about the snowstorm we changed our mind and left Tuesday night. But I don't think it made that much of a difference," he said, noting the heavy traffic.By early afternoon, airlines had canceled more than 10 percent of their flights at Philadelphia, Newark Liberty and LaGuardia airports.The wintry weather was not confined to the Northeast. An Alberta clipper left many highways in North and South Dakota slick, and a winter storm warning was issued for parts of Minnesota.The Wednesday before Thanksgiving is often called the nation's busiest travel day of the year, but that's probably not true. A U.S. Transportation Department study based on 2001 figures found that when car trips are taken into account, Thanksgiving Day itself is a heavier travel day.An estimated 41.3 million travelers are expected to hit the nation's highways between Wednesday and Sunday, a 4.3 percent increase over last year, said Robert Sinclair Jr. of AAA New York.As for air travel, the Wednesday before Thanksgiving didn't even rank among the Top 10 busiest days of 2013, the Transportation Security Administration found.The top airline travel day last year was the Sunday after Thanksgiving, with 2.2 million passengers. The Friday before Memorial Day was second at 2.1 million.---Associated Press Writers Jill Colvin in Newark, New Jersey; David Dishneau in Hagerstown, Maryland; Michael Hill in Albany; and Scott Mayerowitz and Karen Matthews in New York contributed to this report.See more crazy snow from this season:

The segment is set to air on his show Friday.But Dr. Phil's story went from tragic to controversial with this comment..."I'm telling you, even I could get laid in a women's prison.""What?!""I am big in women's prison, let me tell you.

http://www.aol.com/article/2014/10/22/gunman-storms-canadian-parliament-shoots-at-least-two-people/20982293/	There will be no safe haven': Canadian PM Harper vows action after terror attack on Parliament	Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper told a captive national audience only hours after a shooting at Parliament Hill that Canada will stop at nothing to bring those who threaten his nation to justice.Harper made the defiant remarks in a short statement Wednesday night after a Muslim gunman shot dead a Canadian soldier and stormed parliament with a loaded gun looking for blood. The assailant, said to be Michael Zehalf-Bibeau, was gunned down by capitol security."We will not be intimidated. Canada will never be intimidated," said Harper.The prime minister's assurances came after Cpl. Nathan Cirillo was shot dead at the Canadian National War Memorial by Zehaf-Bibeau, officials said.Zehaf-Bibeau was cut down in a hail of bullets, heroically killed by the sergeant-at-arms.Cirillo died for standing guard over the tomb of the unknown soldier, at the National War Monument, just before 10:00 a.m. Wednesday. His killer's identity was first reported by CBS News."Captain Cerillo was killed today in cold blood," said Harper. "Canada is not immune to the types of terror attacks we have seen elsewhere in the world."Zehaf-Bibeau reportedly changed his name from Michael Joseph Hall after recently converting to Islam. It is not known if he had ties to ISIS, was an ISIS sympathizer or acted on his own volition.His picture was reportedly first circulated on Twitter by an ISIS-affiliated account."We will redouble our efforts to fight against terrorist organizations around the world," Harper vowed. "There will be no safe haven for those who try to bring savagery to our shores."It still is not clear if there is more than one shooting suspect being sought after by Ottawa authorities. Harper did not address that angle, or how Canada would further hunt down terror suspects.Several blocks of Ottawa remained on lockdown late into the night.Authorities from multiple branches of law enforcement all danced around answering whether there was more than one suspect during an afternoon press conference, but did admit they did not see the attack coming."It caught us by surprise," an unusually candid Gilles Michaud, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, National Division, commanding officer admitted. "It's too early to get to the bottom of what transpired."Michaud and others refused to confirm the Zehaf-Bibeau's religion despite rampant speculation on U.S. cable news that the suspect was a Muslim.Multiple officials referred to the situation as "dynamic" and "fluid," but infuriated reporters by deciding against directly answering if there was more than on shooter.The soldier died around 1:00 p.m., sources told the AFP. He was a reservist based out of Hamilton, in suburban Toronto, according to Canadian media."Today is a sad and tragic day for our city and our country," said Ottawa mayor Jim Watson. "There's no pain greater than losing a loved one, to have it happen under such circumstances is beyond expression."Three other people with minor injuries were also reportedly released late Wednesday afternoon from local hospitals.Zehaf-Bibeau first approached the soldier standing at the war memorial, on Parliament Hill across the street from the Parliament, according to the CBC. He fired four shots in rapid succession as soldiers chased after him, a witness told the network."I saw the gunman run across the street with a rifle in his right hand," the witness added. "He ran towards Parliament Hill."Gunfire erupted as the bearded, scarf-wearing assailant entered the Parliament. Anywhere from 30 to 50 shots were fired, according to various reports.Dramatic video from the Toronto Globe and Mail shows the hail of gunfire inside the Parliament. Sergeant-at-arms Kevin Vickers reportedly shot Zehaf-Bibeau dead. MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms. - Craig Scott (@CraigScottNDP) October 22, 2014The building and surrounding area were immediately placed under lockdown amid reports there may be more than one gunman.Varying reports have claimed suspects could be on rooftops with high-powered rifles or even on motorbikes, but nothing has been confirmed.Gunfire has reportedly erupted around the city at various times, including at a nearby hotel and near the Rideau Shopping Center, have emerged. But no further details have been made available.Early reports indicated shots were fired inside the shopping mall, but a spokesperson reached by AOL News said: "I can definitely deny that."The shot soldier slumped over and was bleeding as the scene unfolded at Parliament. He is one of two soldiers who stand guard at the monument 24-hours-a-day, according to the CBC.Passersby began performing CPR on the critically wounded soldier in a desperate attempt to save his life until about half a dozen paramedics arrived.The soldier was rushed to a hospital, he is said by the CBC to be in serious condition and has since succumbed to his injuries.Pictures from the scene show various law enforcement and military agencies assuming tactical positions in the area around Parliament Hill as late as 11:00 a.m.Not motives have yet been established, but all Canadian Armed Forces bases were closed Wednesday morning to public entry as a precaution. Also closed down are all bridges from Ottawa to the neighboring city of Gatineau.PM Harper cancelled a meeting with Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai scheduled for Wednesday afternoon in Toronto.An NHL hockey game scheduled for Wednesday evening between the Toronto Maple Leafs and Ottawa Senators, in Ottawa, has been postponed until further notice.Wednesday's incident came only one day after one Canadian soldier was killed in a hit-and-run accident labeled a terrorist attack by Prime Minister Harper.Both attacks came only days after the country announced it was joining the U.S.-led assault on ISIS in Iraq and Syria.U.S. authorities have taken a number of measures in response to the incidents including placing the American Embassy in Ottawa on lockdown and placing NORAD on higher alert should any threat to airlines emerge.
http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/clippers/2014/05/15/donald-sterling-letter-to-nba/9151207/	Donald Sterling tells NBA he won't pay fine	Banned Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling won't pay the $2.5 million fine levied by the NBA, Sterling's attorney wrote in a letter to the NBA, a person with first-hand knowledge of the letter told USA TODAY Sports.The person requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the letter, which was sent Thursday.The attorney, Maxwell M. Blecher, also wrote that Sterling doesn't warrant "any punishment at all" for his racist comments that were recorded in a conversation with a female friend and made public.SHAME: Sterling, not Magic, should be ashamedLEVERAGE: Sterling's wife holding divorce papersBlecher, a well-known antitrust attorney, also contends that the fine violates Sterling's due process rights.NBA Commissioner Adam Silver on April 29 fined Sterling $2.5 million and issued him a lifetime ban. Silver also said he will urge other owners to force a sale of the Clippers and do everything in his power to ensure that.If three-fourths of the other 29 owners agree to Silver's recommendation, Sterling will be forced to sell the team he has owned since 1981.After the ruling, players, fellow owners and civil rights leaders applauded Silver. Union representatives had discussed a boycott of playoff games had Silver not delivered such a strong ruling.Sterling has already missed the deadline for paying fine, which earlier this week.It is not a surprise Sterling's attorney threatened a legal battle. Sterling is well-known for litigious tactics, and the league had been expecting Sterling to fight.LITIGIOUS: Sterling known as 'tyrannical' in courtVIDEO: Did Sterling on CNN do more damage?The letter was in direct response to the fine and the lifetime ban. The NBA's advisory-finance committee was also notified of the letter.Blecher is one of Sterling's longtime lawyers and represented Sterling when he moved the Clippers from San Diego to Los Angeles in 1984, and the NBA fined him $25 million. Sterling sued the league for $100 million and dropped it when the NBA reduced his fine to $6 million.GALLERY: Donald Sterling through the years
http://wallstcheatsheet.com/business/how-americas-middle-class-dug-its-own-grave.html/?ref=YF	How America’s Middle Class Dug Its Own Grave	The U.S. Capitol is reflected in a fountain full of coins on the plaza, November 4, 2014 in Washington, DC. Today Americans head to the polls to cast their vote in the mid-term elections which will ultimately decide which party controls the Senate. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)When something goes wrong, people can’t help but point fingers. For example, academics and historians are still arguing over who is to blame for World War I. Was it Germany, which whet the Austro-Hungarian appetite for war during the July Crisis? Was it Serbia, which at the time was consumed by a flood of nationalism? Was it Britain’s failure to mediate? This debate is still alive today, a century after the start of the war, because finding the most correct answer to these questions is still incredibly valuable, and difficult. In the buildup to the war, whoever pointed their finger most convincingly swayed public policy, and in retrospect, history lessons are most valuable when we’ve got the cause-effect relationship as correct as possible.The same thing is happening today in the political sphere of the United States. Following the September 11th terrorist attacks, to pick an example, politicians and the public nearly drowned in an ocean of finger pointing. For a while, it was not clear who was rightly to blame, but in the zealous years following the attacks, politicians rode a wave of public support and took steps to remedy the situation, even before there was any time to double-check the research. Ultimately, in March 2003, that led to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.Blame for the invasion — which ultimately turned into a war lasting more than a decade — has been passed around like a hot potato. Do we blame President George W. Bush for having an itchy trigger finger? Do we blame Congress for failing to check the administration? Or do we blame the general public — voters, to be specific — for electing those decision makers in the first place?There have been situations, such as during the 2000 presidential election, in which one candidate won the popular vote, but ultimately lost at the hand of a Supreme Court decision. Those events were unprecedented, and also haven’t been repeated since. While it’s an example of how the election system can veer off the rails, by and large, the system does a fair job at exacting the will of the majority when deciding between two or three candidates.One popular idea is that given the nature of the geopolitical climate and landscape, there was little anyone outside the government could have done to stop the war in Iraq from happening. Public activism may have caused a stir, but the powers that be would have eventually gotten the war they wanted. Many Americans feel like this notion exonerates them from responsibility for the war, but that’s not necessarily true; Americans do bear responsibility, because they are responsible for the placement of members of Congress as well as the president — the only people with the authority to take military action.

http://sports.yahoo.com/news/pickups-of-the-week-035030003.html	Pickups of the Week: Bridgewater, Asiata, Vikes D to leave trophy under tree	This week, Brad Evans has identified five intriguing fantasy football players, and a defense, likely to be available on the waiver wire in fantasy leagues.[Join FanDuel.com's $2.5M Week 17 fantasy league: $25 to enter; top 21,840 teams paid]Teddy Bridgewater (QB) Minnesota Vikings Touchdown Teddy is primed to live up to his college nickname. The passer, despite little fanfare, has performed admirably this season. He’s hasn’t shook the fantasy world, but he’s routinely delivered strikes to receivers, particularly down the stretch. In his past four contests, he’s completed a remarkable 73 percent of his attempts. Equally impressive, he’s also logged four multi-TD games in his past five. Another unsung performance is on the horizon. Matthew Stafford dropped the ball last week in Chicago, but make no mistake, the Bears remain a pushover on pass defense. On the year, they’ve surrendered 8.12 yards per attempt and 20.9 fantasy points per game in standard Yahoo formats. Bridgewater is your Christmas miracle, Tom Brady owners.FAAB Bid: $10 ($100 budget)C.J. Spiller (RB) Buffalo Bills Widely expected to be an employable RB2 in 12-team and deeper leagues entering the season, Spiller, who missed several weeks with a busted collarbone, understandably played a minimal impact in his return to the lineup Week 16 in Oakland. Seeing just 18 snaps, he touched the ball eight times for 10 yards. However, with the dust kicked off and the rusher motivated to show his wares to potential free-agent suitors, he could thrive in your championship. Buffalo’s opponent, New England, has yielded the fewest fantasy points to RBs since Week 10, but if Denver were to lose in Cincy on Monday, it would clinch home-field throughout the playoffs. That happens and it’s likely Bill Belichick rests his starters. Even if that scenario doesn't play out, Spiller is still a candidate for 70-plus yards and a score on 12-14 touches. FAAB Bid: $13Matt Asiata (RB) Minnesota Vikings He’s the antithesis of "sexy," but, shockingly, Asiata is on track to finish as a top-20 fantasy rusher this season. Because of a limited skill set and unexciting highlight reel, many have kept the Viking at arm’s length. Still, it’s hard to dispute his consistent production. Yes he’s averaged a stomach-churning 3.3 yards per carry, but his steady dose of 15-plus touches per game, many of those at the goal line, and plus-receiving ability designate him a reliable RB2, especially in PPR formats. Blessed with an ultra-friendly home matchup against Chicago, he should be a near lock for 60 or more yards and a touchdown. Available in nearly two-thirds of Yahoo leagues, the terribly underrated Purple Pounder deserves a plug ‘n play.FAAB Bid: $21Eddie Royal (WR) San Diego Chargesr Without Keenan Allen in uniform, the Prince of PPR is a target worth bowing down to. In an expanded role last week in an improbable come-from-behind victory against San Fran, Royal hauled in 10 receptions (on 12 targets) for 94 yards and a touchdown, seeing action on 96.5 percent of San Diego’s snaps. The Chargers, undeniably the biggest winner in the AFC playoff hunt in Week 16, control their own destiny. A win Sunday against Kansas City, and they punch their ticket for the second season. The paper matchup is intimidating. The Chiefs, led by premier corner Sean Smith, have given up the eighth-fewest fantasy points to wide receivers this year. However, Royal is a slippery underneath weapon who is sure to be a key player in San Diego’s vertical game plan. Another 10-plus targets aren't out of the question, making him a viable WR3 even in 10-team leagues.FAAB Bid:$15Minnesota Vikings Defense/Special Teams John Randle, Chris Doleman and Joey Browner are no longer striking fear into the hearts of offensive coordinators, but the Vikings, an opportunistic unit this season, have contributed consistent meaningful fantasy stats all year at home. In seven contests at T&F Bank Stadium, they’ve scored at least 10 fantasy points four times. Jimmy Clausen, surprisingly, wasn’t a train wreck in his starting debut with Chicago. However, he won't play in Week 17 due to a concussion as the Bears turn back to turnover-prone Jay Cutler. While Minnesota failed to record a QB take-down when the clubs first clashed in Week 11, the rematch will surely be a different story. Add. Play. Streak your house in title jubilation.FAAB Bid: $5ADDITIONAL PICKUPS (If you didn't grab them last week): Alex Smith, KC, QB, Case Keenum, Hou, QB, Devonta Feeman, Atl, RB, Charles Johnson, Min, WRWant to bull rush Brad?

http://www.buzzfeed.com/dominicholden/prominent-lgbt-activist-pleads-not-guilty-to-sex-with-minor	Prominent LGBT Activist Pleads Not Guilty To Sex With Minor	Terry Bean, a real estate investor and LGBT activist, told an Oregon judge this morning he was not guilty of having sex with a 15-year-old boy. View this image › Portland Police Bureau Early Wednesday morning, three lawyers accompanied Terry Bean, the 66-year-old co-founder of the Human Rights Campaign and fundraising superstar for Democratic candidates, into a Eugene, Oregon, courtroom for an arraignment hearing where he faced three counts of having sex with a 15-year-old boy. Bean pled not guilty. Bean’s lawyers then accompanied him to a local jail to discuss terms of his bail, a prosecutor handling the case told BuzzFeed News. “My lawyers have insisted that the facts come out in the courtroom and not in the press, but I am eager to share the truth,” Bean posted on his personal Facebook page on Nov. 25. Portland police first reported Bean’s arrest in November, but an indictment naming charges against him became available today. Those records, obtained by BuzzFeed News, charge Bean with two felony counts of sodomy in the third degree, for having anal and oral sex with a child under 16 years old, and one misdemeanor count of sex abuse of a child. The indictment mirrors charges against Bean’s ex-boyfriend, Kiah Loy Lawson, who entered a not-guilty plea last month. Both men are accused in the same alleged crime. Typically, court records are available under open records laws that shed light on the underlying claims from prosecutors. But the assistant district attorney handling this case, Erik Hasselman, told BuzzFeed News that in Oregon, secret grand juries typically decide to bring felony charges, which occurred in this case, and they have no legal obligation to disclose the facts or evidence that justifies probable cause. He said those records are not released unless the defendant seeks a jury trial or faces sentencing. Hasselman said Bean’s lawyers are Kristen Winemiller, Lisa Maxfield, and Shaun McCrea. They did not respond to a request from BuzzFeed News for a statement about the case or Bean’s plea. A real-estate investor, Bean co-founded the Gay & Lesbian Victory Fund and HRC, a pioneering LGBT rights group. He gained national prominence as a donor and fundraiser for the Obama presidential campaigns. Bean’s next hearing is set for Jan. 7 in Lane County Circuit Court.
http://gizmodo.com/heath-ledgers-greatest-movie-wasnt-a-dark-knight-1667790867	Heath Ledger's Greatest Movie Wasn't The Dark Knight	Heath Ledger was probably best known for his roles in Brokeback Mountain and The Dark Knight — and quite rightly so, given his stellar performances. But let's be honest. His best work was really a predictable, badly scripted but hilariously funny medieval comedy.In case you're not familiar, A Knight's Tale is basically Rocky with horses and jousting, all set to a soundtrack of Queen. It's cheesy, predictable, with an over-the-top villain and too-perfect girl, but despite all that, it's still excellent. Ledger and Paul Bettany make this film, with good acting saving the slightly over-the-top dialogue.It's a far more raw take on medieval life than most action films involving knights in armor — no pitched battles or appeals to a higher power. Best of all, it's just been released on Netflix Instant, so it'll only take you about three clicks and one bag of popcorn to get set up for the evening.

Moscow is anxious for the relations to advance but only as long as there is "equality and mutual respect."Conspicuously absent from the list of the recipients of New Year's messages was Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.
http://tv.yahoo.com/blogs/tv-news/walking-dead-brain-dead-move-beth-185222242.html	The 'Walking Dead' Brain-Dead Move of the Week: Uh, Letting This Episode Air?	Tyler James Williams as Noah and Emily Kinney as Beth Greene on 'The Walking Dead' (AMC)Every week on The Walking Dead, someone does something stupid that needlessly endangers the lives of themselves and others. Here, we commemorate those decisions in the hopes that they won't be repeated. But of course, we know they will be.First of all: What the hell was that? Instead of a normal episode of The Walking Dead this week, we got Beth starring in some B-movie zombie flick with wooden acting, laughable dialogue, and barely any zombies. If this was called Zombie Hospital and airing at 2 a.m. on Syfy, we would've changed the channel.Related: Take a Bite Out of Our 'Walking Dead' RecapsMost disappointing is seeing Christine Woods, so great on the HBO comedy Hello Ladies as a struggling actress, play a ridiculous cop who rules the hospital with an iron fist. (Who put her in charge, exactly?) When she was slapping Beth (twice!) or saying lines like this:We could only think of this scene from Hello Ladies.And that guy giggling in the background pretty much sums up our reaction to this week's episode.But we're not here to giggle; we're here to bring you a Brain-Dead Move. And though it was slim pickings this week, due to the episode's bizarre nature and lack of walkers, Beth did make a key miscalculation late in the game.  Related: 'The Walking Dead' Postmortem With Emily Kinney and Tyler James WilliamsDetermined to get away from Mean Cop Lady and Creepy Lollipop Cop (sorry, we're not bothering to learn their names), Beth teams up with janitor Noah to cook up a not-very-well-thought-out escape plan that involves dropping down an elevator shaft into a pile of dead bodies and then… blindly making a run for it, we guess?Never mind that there are men with high-powered rifles stationed on the rooftops, ready to shoot you. But Beth and Noah did actually have a chance at a clean getaway: There was a line of cars waiting outside!Maybe one of them had keys in it. Or maybe Noah knows how to hotwire one. (C'mon, we've seen more inexplicable things than that on this show.) The point is, they didn't even check; they just ran right past the cars and stumbled into a wave of walkers, with Beth getting recaptured as Noah managed to squeeze through a fence and escape.Emily Kinney as Beth on 'The Walking Dead' (AMC)But at least she was smiling, right? Too bad we weren't.Runners-Up: Beth, for thinking that a tiny IV needle would help her fight off anyone. It's hard enough to get those into someone's arm who's willing!... Creepy Lollipop Cop, for not surveying the room for potential zombies before trying to force himself on Beth. You'd think he'd know how to clear a room… us, for sitting though this episode in the first place. Rick and Daryl are back next week, right? Please?The Walking Dead airs Sundays at 9 p.m. on AMC.

His manager, Barry Bookin, declined comment.According to Los Angeles County prosecutors, Diatchenko had been living with the woman for some time after their romantic relationship had ended.She told Diatchenko that they should stop being roommates, prosecutors said.On Dec. 7, while she was out of the house, Diatchenko killed the rabbit, authorities said."Diatchenko skinned the pet, cooked it and ate half of it while sending her step-by-step pictures of what he did" according to a statement from the district attorney's office. "When she returned the defendant allegedly told her he would do the same to her."Born in San Francisco, Diatchenko is an actor and musician. He mainly has played Russians and Eastern Europeans on television. He also had a small part in the movie "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."Diatchenko also has had many voice roles in video games, including in several "Call of Duty" titles.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mary-pritchard/maiden-mother-bitch_b_6276364.html	Maiden, Mother, Bitch	In my sessions with private clients, I often find myself working with traditional female archetypes. The young women I see are often in the midst of their maiden years, trying to figure out just who they are and where they belong the world.My clients in their 30s and 40s (and sometimes 50s) are fully immersed in their mothering years, where caring for themselves usually takes a back burner to caring for their children. These women almost always suffer from a superwoman complex -- feeling they must do everything and do it better than anyone else has before them or they're not good enough. This complex "works" for them for a time, until they grow resentful -- of their children, their spouse, their boss, the world. At that point Superwoman often takes on more of a Martyr complex. She still, begrudgingly, does it all, but she makes sure you know what she's sacrificed for you.This is a complex with which I am very familiar. I grew up with it. My mother had the superwoman/martyr down to a T. It's something we've discussed over the years. At one point I even accused her of liking her role as martyr; an accusation she vehemently denied. Yet, last week I came to a shocking realization. I had become my mother. I had been wearing my superwoman/martyr cape for so long I didn't even know I had put in on. And that both shocked and saddened me.I had an illuminating conversation with my boyfriend about this issue. He asked me, "What happened in your childhood to make you think you always had to do everything for everyone?""My whole childhood was that way," I replied. It wasn't any one thing; it was everything. It was what was expected, how I was raised. I was taught that life was about being of service to others -- at expense to yourself. That's how you prove your worth, your value.Then it occurred to me: I have a choice. I don't have to be a martyr. Women in my generation have many more opportunities than our mothers did. We can choose to play out a different role, roles that our mothers never dreamed possible.But if I'm not a martyr -- if I'm not proving my worth by doing -- then what am I?I learned growing up that I must be of service to others at my own expense. Anything less was selfish. So if I decide to choose differently -- to not be of service at my own expense -- then what does that make me? According to women who suffer the martyr complex, likely I'd be a selfish bitch.Dictionary.com agrees: A bitch is "a malicious, unpleasant, selfish person, especially a woman."I disagree.In her book, The Bitch, the Crone, and the Harlot, Susan Schacterle defines a bitch as:A positive archetype of a Bitch at midlife is that of a woman who has become so comfortable with who she is that she doesn't hesitate to take appropriate action in any situation. Her actions are no longer so governed by what others think, but rather by what she knows to be true. This is a woman whose intuition is so well-developed that she knows in her gut what to do. Part of her personal mission is to perform actions that are shaped by integrity, insight, and compassion. This woman can make things happen anywhere but, unlike the street-defined bitch, there is no selfishness, no unkindness about her; she takes action and creates results that are the highest and best for everyone involved, within a framework of wisdom and love.Now that's a definition I can aspire to! Who wouldn't want to be a bitch with that definition? Sign me up!Yet, if you called a woman a "bitch," I'm guessing very few would say thank you. The negative connotation of the term is too powerful.So what if we, as women, decided to change that? What if we hung up our superwoman capes and said "no thank you" to the martyr complex? What if we embraced our inner bitch, understanding that meant saying yes to our intuition? Our compassion? Ourselves? What if, for once, we were finally and truly comfortable in our own skin? What if we felt free to speak our truth and walk in our power?I'm willing to aspire to be a bitch. Will you join me?
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/high50/married-couples-living-apart_b_6133786.html	Why My Husband And I Would Never Choose To Live Together	Would your marriage be stronger if you and your partner lived apart? When David proposed to Claire after 12 years together, Claire had one question. Would he want to move in? Luckily the answer was no and the now-married couple continue to live happily, apart. Here's Claire's story as told to Kim Willis from High50.Christmas Day 2012 will go down in history in our family. For it was not only the day David asked me to be his wife, but it was also the day that our extended family saw firsthand just how our relationship works.David handed me a small gift and asked me to open it in front of our son, Jay, now six, as well as my other sons, Lee, now 20, Billy, now 18, and Max, now 15, and various aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins, nieces and nephews. A full house, all witness to the proposal.I unwrapped the paper and saw a blue Tiffany velvet purse. Then David knelt before me and presented me with a sparkling diamond ring as he asked if I would marry him.But my first words after his proposal were not yes, as you might expect.My first words were: 'I don't have to live with you, do I?'That was the moment that our family still laugh about -- the moment they understood what David and I are all about.But the best part of the story was the look on David's face. The thought of us moving in together just because he was proposing hadn't even crossed his mind.'God no!' he said. And with that, I accepted his proposal and wrapped my arms around him. I couldn't wait to be his wife, but living together was absolutely out of the question.Unconventional Marriage, But It Works For UsDavid and I might not have followed the normal route into marriage, but who wants to be normal? This set up works for us and had worked for us for 11 years before we married, so changing anything seemed absurd to us.We spent the rest of Christmas Day chatting about wedding plans. Come the evening, David went home, just as he always did.David's flat is seven miles from the house where I live with my three older sons from a previous relationship and Jay, my son with David.What makes our relationship work is trust. I know couples who have lived together for years but they don't trust each other like we do. We don't live separately because David wants to be free to have affairs or anything silly like that. People think he has his own place just so he can cheat on me. I trust him and I don't need him under my roof to know he's not a cheater.We live separately because if we lived together, it would ruin our relationship.Society, and many of our friends and family, might have expected me to give up my independence and my routine but what society doesn't realize is that we'd ultimately give up our relationship if we lived together.David will admit it himself -- he's complex. It's his way or no way. I can cope with that trait if I don't have to live with it -- and I'm sure I have traits he'd rather not live with too.I wouldn't want to change David and I love everything about him, but if we lived together we'd quarrel and then we would either have to change or we'd have to break up. And I just married him -- breaking up is the last thing I'd ever want to do.But as we announced our engagement, friends seemed desperate for us to finally conform and move under one roof.Just because we'd got engaged, it didn't mean we wanted anything to change. Just as it hadn't after we had Jay.Marriage Problems After Child BirthAdmittedly, when Jay was born, we did talk about it. Jay was diagnosed with Down's Syndrome and we thought it would be best for him if we lived together. David stayed over a lot in those early days.But at five weeks old, Jay started sleeping through the night and David started going back to his own place. It was all very well David returning to his house, but I was being left with full responsibility for our baby.That's not what I signed up for -- if we were going to live apart, David wasn't going to act like a bachelor while I dealt with every night shift.So I bought him a cot to take home and told him that although I didn't want to live with him, he was going to have to do his share of the nights.And we were soon arguing over who would get to have Jay for the night.Now Jay goes to David's a few times a week, which is perfect as I get respite and Jay gets quality time with his dad.He runs around packing his bag and telling his half-brothers he's off to his Daddy's house. David's just bought him some fish and Jay loves watching them swim around.On the nights they are at David's, I pour myself a glass of wine and watch my favorite TV shows. David's a National Geographic kind of guy, I like soap operas. Our differences don't rub each other up the wrong way because we don't put ourselves in situations where they matter.The Financial Implications Of Living ApartFinancially, we'd be so much better off if David moved in here. He wouldn't have to pay off a separate mortgage and pay separate bills. We'd be able to get by running just one car.We'd be able to afford a foreign vacation every year. But we would lose who we are and what makes us work.Whenever David comes over, there is such laughter in our house. But like me, the boys never assumed that just because David and I were getting married, he'd move in.I've been married twice before, David has been married once. We both know what it's like to put your finances in one pot and we don't like it, even if it does cost us more this way.Nearly every day from the proposal to the wedding 18 months later, someone asked if getting married meant we'd move in together.But our answer was always a categorical no -- we passed the stage of feeling we need to explain ourselves but people still found us fascinating, asking how we make it work.By the time I've given them my reasons, I usually got told that our decision sounded like a very good idea. Some people even tell me they wish they could do it themselves.We married on the July 19, 2013. Our day had a blue and yellow theme, the colors of the Down Syndrome Awareness campaign.We spent our first night as man and wife in the honeymoon suite of a hotel and had to share a bed. As usual, it was a disaster. It's impossible to sleep next to David, he's so spread-eagled. And he snores.I've never stayed over at his place but David occasionally stays at mine. I've taken to putting him in the spare room when he does. We make love -- of course we do. We're just creative.David is a fireman and works odd shifts and I'm a full time mum so sometimes he'll pop over during the day... After 13 years together I still feel excited when I see him.David can be who he is and I can be who I am and we can do what we do best -- laugh, have fun, enjoy each other. We're not dragged down by the day to day problems of life.We are always delighted to see each other and don't get annoyed by the little things that can weigh a relationship down, like teabags in the sink or an overflowing trashcan.We don't fall out over anything -- I can't remember the last time we squabbled.We're not holding on to our independence, we are holding on to our relationship. Our marriage works just perfectly living apart, together.Related articles:• Is There Such A Thing As A Happy Divorce? • Is There A Place For Porn In Your Relationship?• Love Hit Me Out Of The BlueEarlier on Huff/Post50:
http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/cycling/2012/10/10/lance-armstrong-usada-reasoned-decision-teammates-doping/1624551/	USADA releases massive evidence vs. Lance Armstrong	One former teammate of Armstrong's, George Hincapie, issued a statement confirming his own role in the doping conspiracy and saying he told investigators the truth 'about everything I knew.'The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency on Wednesday released its evidence against Lance Armstrong – a massive dossier of more than 1,000 pages with sworn testimony from 26 people, including 15 cyclists with knowledge of Armstrong's doping activities on the U.S. Postal Service Cycling team.The evidence includes testimony from cyclist George Hincapie, a longtime close associate of Armstrong's who on Wednesday admitted his role in the doping conspiracy and said he told investigators what he knew about others."I would have been much more comfortable talking only about myself, but understood that I was obligated to tell the truth about everything I knew. So that is what I did," Hincapie's statement said.In a statement, USADA chief executive Travis Tygart said, "The evidence shows beyond any doubt that the US Postal Service Pro Cycling Team ran the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen."USADA DOCUMENT: Read the entire case against Lance ArmstrongINSIDE DETAILS: Key evidence in the USADA's caseUSADA said the evidence includes "direct documentary evidence including financial payments, emails, scientific data and laboratory test results that further prove the use, possession and distribution of performance enhancing drugs by Lance Armstrong and confirm the disappointing truth about the deceptive activities of the USPS Team, a team that received tens of millions of American taxpayer dollars in funding."Eleven Armstrong teammates testified against him, including six active riders who were given six-month suspensions for their own doping: Hincapie, Frankie Andreu, Michael Barry, Tom Danielson, Tyler Hamilton, Floyd Landis, Levi Leipheimer, Stephen Swart, Christian Vande Velde, Jonathan Vaughters and David Zabriskie."Together these different categories of eyewitness, documentary, first-hand, scientific, direct and circumstantial evidence reveal conclusive and undeniable proof that brings to the light of day for the first time this systemic, sustained and highly professionalized team-run doping conspiracy," USADA said.USADA posted the detailed evidence on its website Wednesday.PHOTO GALLERY: Key players in the Armstrong caseHincapie's statement acknowledged that he had cheated."Early in my professional career, it became clear to me that, given the widespread use of performance enhancing drugs by cyclists at the top of the profession, it was not possible to compete at the highest level without them. I deeply regret that choice and sincerely apologize to my family, teammates and fans," Hincapie wrote.In a statement, Armstrong attorney Tim Herman attacked the credibility of USADA's case."Tygart's statement confirms the alleged 'reasoned decision' from USADA will be a one-sided hatchet job -- a taxpayer-funded tabloid piece rehashing old, disproved, unreliable allegations based largely on axe-grinders, serial perjurers, coerced testimony, sweetheart deals and threat-induced stories," Herman wrote.On Wednesday night, Armstrong tweeted, "What am I doing tonight? Hanging with my family, unaffected, and thinking about this.." followed by a link to his Livestrong Foundation's web site.USADA released the report as required by its decision in August to give Armstrong a lifetime ban and strip him of his seven titles in the Tour de France. In June, the agency formally accused Armstrong and other team officials of using banned drugs and blood transfusions to gain an edge in competition over several years.By rule, USADA was mandated by the World Anti-Doping Code to deliver a detailed report on its decision to the interested parties, which include the World Anti-Doping Agency and the athlete's international federation.In this case, the Armstrong's international federation for cycling is the International Cycling Union (UCI). After receiving the report, UCI has 21 days to appeal the Armstrong sanctions. If an appeal is lodged, the matter will go to arbitration at the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland. UCI previously has been critical of USADA's case against Armstrong, questioning whether he received his due process. UCI also questioned the fairness of making deals with other riders to testify against Armstrong in exchange for less severe punishment for doping. USADA shot back at UCI and accused the organization of having a lackluster record on doping and a cozy relationship with Armstrong. In "The Secret Race," the recent book by cyclist Tyler Hamilton, the author alleges Armstrong worked with UCI to have a positive drug test covered up at the Tour of Switzerland in 2001. Armstrong could have fought USADA's charges by going to arbitration in front of a three-person panel, with one panelist picked by both sides and the other selected by the other two. But he claimed the process as "rigged" against him and announced in August he would no longer fight the charges.He maintained his innocence, saying he never failed a drug test. USADA noted that Armstrong's team used sophisticated techniques to avoid testing positive and that there is no test for blood transfusions.In a letter sent to USADA on Tuesday, Armstrong's attorney, Herman, said that some of the witnesses against the cyclist are "serial perjurers."
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/12/07/intel-and-swiftkey-gave-stephen-hawking-a-life-cha.aspx	Intel and SwiftKey Gave Stephen Hawking a "Life-Changing" Upgrade -- Will It Change Your Life, Too?	Stephen Hawking using his new ACAT input and communications system. Image source: Intel.Celebrated cosmologist Stephen Hawking has been confined to a wheelchair since the 1960s, devastated by Lou Gehrig's disease. The illness eventually limited his communications with the world around him to twitching his cheek muscles. A computer system interprets these movements, yielding roughly one word per minute.But things have changed. Thanks to research by technology giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC  ) and predictive typing specialist SwiftKey, the frail genius now uses a much better speech system -- one that he himself hails as "life-changing."What's new? The new system, known as the Assistive Context-Aware Toolkit or ACAT for short, has been in development for two years and is shaped to fit Hawkings' needs exactly. He has been using the new toolkit for several months, is finally ready to spread the word in public, and will continue testing ACAT in private for another few weeks.And then, Intel will release ACAT's source code as an open-source project, so that developers around the world can build new tools on the same foundation. SwiftKey's proprietary language models and predictive text library will stay behind lock and key, being tailor-made for Hawking.Building a business on free platforms To me, that's the exciting part. Yes, it's great to see one of the world's brightest minds gaining new powers of communication. If he can write more books, give new lectures, and generally share his brilliance, the world at large will benefit. But the effects of unleashing the ACAT tools under an open-source license may turn out to be even greater.ACAT is based on Intel and SwiftKey's mobile technologies, which you can find in smartphones, laptops, and tablets today. But they take the predictive text input idea in a new direction, providing different interpretations for different situations. Giving a speech, speed may matter more than complete accuracy. Writing a book, it's the other way around.Current technologies don't adjust to these circumstances, but ACAT does. And soon, you'll see hobbyists and large corporations alike hashing out new ways to use and improve Hawkings' system. Businesses may be built around this input method and its extreme focus on custom-fitted, user-friendly operation.Open-source systems tend to do that, particularly when they solve common problems with high-quality tools. I'd say that faster and better user input into computer systems counts as a common use case with plenty of room for improvement. And if ACAT is good enough to impress the notoriously picky Stephen Hawking, I'm pretty sure it could make a real impact on your life and mine as well.Now before you write off the potential business impact as a ridiculous idea, let me highlight a couple of success stories. Red Hat sells nothing but open-source software and top-notch support contracts for these tools. Here's a six-year chart of Red Hat's market-crushing returns:RHT data by YChartsThe Firefox web browser is also entirely open-sourced, developed by volunteers for the non-profit Mozilla foundation. Today, Firefox is the third most used browser in the world.There's no guarantee that ACAT will spark a game-changing success story like Firefox or Linux. However, growth investors should keep a close eye on what gets built around Stephen Hawkings' speech and writing tools and be ready to invest if and when a solid business emerges.Apple Watch revealed: The real winner is inside Here's one market that looks like a serious opportunity for ACAT-based improvements. Apple recently revealed the product of its secret-development "dream team" -- Apple Watch. The secret is out, and some early viewers are claiming its everyday impact could trump the iPod, iPhone, and the iPad. In fact, ABI Research predicts 485 million of this type of device will be sold per year. But one small company makes Apple's gadget possible. And its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors. To be one of them, and see where the real money is to be made, just click here!

http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/17/travel/national-aviation-day-feat/?iid=ob_homepage_deskrecommended_pool&iref=obnetwork	5 cool ways to celebrate the wonder of human flight	(CNN)Dear aviation, are you OK? You're getting up there in years now, and travelers are taking you for granted.Almost 112 years ago, when you were first hangin' out with the Wright Brothers, you were practically a miracle. Now -- for a lot of folks -- you're nothing more than a cramped seat from L.A. to New York.In the U.S., nearly 850 million passengers flew last year during the safest period in aviation history -- that's an increase of 2.6% from the year before. Worldwide, more than 3.3 billion flew. That's a record.Hey, aviation, that's kind of impressive. You deserve some respect. Somebody should throw you a damn party. The country needs to give you a day all to yourself.Already done.Forget about National Whiner Day and National Cheeseball Day. This Wednesday, August 19, is National Aviation Day, thanks to a presidential proclamation made in 1939.There are plenty of reasons to celebrate. Air travel has improved life for countless tourists, shoppers and business people.It's fast. Only 90 years ago, the fastest passenger ticket took travelers from New York to Los Angeles by train in 72 hours. Now, we can fly it in six.It's relatively comfortable. (The first airline seats were made of wicker).For a lot of people, flying is just plain fun. (Pun intended.) Think personal in-flight entertainment systems. Think about the thrill of soaring high in the sky.Of course, like a lot of things, it ain't perfect. Complaints about airlines soared by 20% during the first half of this year.But while there's plenty of room for improvement, the future looks bright. Some very cool, technologically sophisticated airliners are already on their way to serving travelers around the world.So -- warts and all -- let's celebrate you, aviation -- just for one day.Here are five ideas on how to enjoy and appreciate the wonder of human flight.1. See the plane that eradicated vomitingTravel to the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum companion facility outside Washington to pay homage to one of history's groundbreaking airliners.The Clipper Flying Cloud is the world's last surviving Boeing 307 Stratoliner -- the first successful commercial airliner with a pressurized cabin.The plane's pressurized cabin virtually "eradicated" passenger airsickness, said Bob van der Linden, a Smithsonian curator. For the first time, the Stratoliner could fly airline passengers high above bad weather, where the ride is smoother."Anytime you travel anywhere, you should tip your hat to 307 because that airplane allows you to get there with a lot more comfort and without throwing up all over the place," van der Linden said with a chuckle. Flying on the Stratoliner was expensive -- limited to high-roller passengers, the Concorde-fliers of their day.Its interior "is just gorgeous," he said, including 33 big, comfortable, reclining seats and cabin walls decorated with beautiful maps of the world.First flying in 1938, only 10 of these airplanes were made, due to the outbreak of World War II. The Clipper Flying Cloud sits inside the museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia.2. Fly the world's only 'Connie' that takes passengersHere's a very rare bird -- a half-century-old icon that you can still fly on.It's Lockheed's L-1049 Super Constellation. Fans call it the "Connie.""Almost all aviators talk about the Super Constellation as the most beautiful airliner ever built," says veteran Swissair 747 pilot Ernst Frei.As a boy, Frei fell in love with the Connie's unusual curved lines, high-landing gear, dolphin-shaped nose and distinctive triple tail. He told his mother he dreamed of flying one someday. Eventually his dream came true. Eleven years ago, Frei became chief pilot of the last flying Super Constellation that still takes passengers.If your dream is to fly on the Connie, beware: It could punch a hole in your wallet.All passengers must first join the Super Constellation Flyers Association for around $120, and then purchase tickets for flights starting at $230. The memberships and airfares support the plane's $1.1 million budget, along with a sponsorship from watchmaker Breitling.From May through the fall, the plane hosts pleasure flights to European destinations in Germany, Switzerland, Belgium and elsewhere. Connie lovers travel from around the world for the experience. Frei recommends that trans-Atlantic travelers fly to Zurich and take an hourlong train ride to Basel, where the plane is based.3. Fly like the Wright brothersWant to experience flying the way the Wright brothers did? Travel to Dayton, Ohio, and climb aboard a lookalike of the Wright brothers' first factory-built plane: the Wright "B" Flyer.For the price of a $100 membership, you can experience the wind-in-your-hair sensation of pioneer flight aboard the two-seater plane, nicknamed the "Brown Bird."It's not the most efficient way to travel. The plane burns 20 gallons of fuel an hour. As you might expect, this thing flies slow and low. It takes 10 minutes to reach just 500 feet of altitude. Top speed: 50 mph. Maximum altitude: 3,000 feet. Flying aboard the Brown Bird must be like riding a 3,400-pound bicycle with wings.Owners of the Brown Bird hope to resurrect the Wrights' original airplane factory to produce modern versions of the B Flyer, which would meet modern airworthiness standards.4. Engines? We don't need no stinking enginesSensational. Spectacular. Breathtaking. Those are words people often use when they talk about their first glider flights.Part of the thrill, says Eric Bick of the Soaring Society of America, is that you're sitting in a cockpit almost totally surrounded by a transparent canopy."Your view is huge, from horizon to horizon," Bick says. "The only thing between you and the sky is this little eighth-inch of plexiglass." First-timers notice the silence. You hear the sound of the wind, but there's no engine noise.The whole experience almost gives you a feeling like you, yourself, are actually flying -- without an airplane.You also might find yourself flying with eagles."This really knocks the socks off of people," Bick says. "Sometimes eagles or hawks will accept the glider as being a compatriot up there," and other times they'll attack, he said with a chuckle. "It's astounding."For pilots, soaring is "sort of the equivalent of a Formula One race car," Bick says. "You're not going 150-200 mph around a track, but you're going into a snug little cockpit and you've got an instrument panel in front of you. One thing about soaring is you're always thinking about what you're going to be doing next."Gliderports -- where you can slap down about $100 and experience your first flight -- are easy to find.Check out Minden, Nevada; Elmira, New York; Clermont, Florida; and the North Shore of Oahu, Hawaii.The SSA website www.ssa.org has a handy locator map. Don't forget to call ahead.5. DIY: Take a flying lessonFor the hard-core aviation enthusiast, there's a do-it-yourself experience: take a flying lesson. Research local flight schools and sign up for an hourlong introductory flight in a small plane with a certified flight instructor.Watch out, you might get hooked.The annual number of active pilots in the U.S. with FAA student certificates has been rising for four years. Last year, there were more than 120,500, according to the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. Thousands of new student pilots are strapping into the cockpit every year. The FAA issued about 49,500 student pilot certificates in 2013, according toAOPA.You don't need a student certificate to fly with an instructor, but you will need one if you eventually fly solo.Getting a pilot's license -- officially known as a pilot certificate -- may be easier than you think. A 2004 FAA rule allows wannabe fliers to earn pilot certificates in less time -- albeit with more limitations.The Sport Pilot Rule is "a great way to get in the cockpit and get flying and be able to take a passenger and go somewhere," says AOPA's Katie Pribyl.So, here's to you, aviation. Enjoy your day. Thanks for making it possible for humans to spread their wings and experience the miracle of flight.
http://sports.yahoo.com/news/browns-star-gordon-set-return-suspension-233020714--nfl.html	Browns WR Gordon returns from ban Monday	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- For two months, suspended wide receiver Josh Gordon has passed Browns offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan in the hallway and had the same conversation.''I always ask him how many days, and he always knows the exact number,'' Shanahan said.It's down to just a few.Gordon's 10-game suspension for repeated violations of the NFL's drug policy is set to end Monday, when the Pro Bowler will be allowed to rejoin his teammates after being exiled since September.The Browns, who managed to move into first place in the AFC North without Gordon, can't wait to have their troubled, big playmaking star back in the huddle.''I can't wait to get him back, looking forward to it,'' said Shanahan, who hasn't been able to devise a game plan that includes Gordon. ''I haven't seen him out on the football field since training camp, so we got to see where he's at physically and everything and we'll try to get him in there. And as soon as he's ready to go, we'll make sure to work to get him the ball.''Gordon had a one-year ban reduced to 10 games on Sept. 19 for numerous failed drug tests. The Browns had feared they would be without him all season, but the lessening of his suspension will bring him back just as the club is poised to make a strong run at making the playoffs for the first time since 2002.The 23-year-old Gordon emerged as one of the league's most dynamic players in 2013.Despite being suspended for the season's first two games, Gordon, who had substance abuse issues in college, led the league with 1,646 yards receiving, scored nine touchdowns and had consecutive 200-yard games. He became the first Browns player to lead the league in yards receiving and he appeared to be on the brink of superstardom when it was revealed in May that he failed another test for marijuana.Months of legal entanglement followed and Gordon damaged his chances of getting any leniency when he was arrested on drunken driving charges in North Carolina.Gordon's legal team unsuccessfully argued to an arbitrator that his failed drug test was the result of secondhand smoke and he was pushed to the sideline, forced to sit and watch for 10 games.On the brink of his return, his teammates believe Gordon is ready to atone for his missteps.''His mindset is he wants to come back and do something special in the last six games,'' safety Donte Whitner said. ''I don't know if that's go for 1,000 yards in six games or something like that, but I know he wants to do something special. I know he missed two games last year and went over 1,600, so he can do some special things.''Gordon has only been allowed to work out by himself during the suspension. When the Browns have practiced outdoors, Gordon has been confined to the indoor field house, working with a strength coach and catching passes from a machine.He's told his teammates he's ready.''He's just hungry, man, just so hungry and excited to get back out here,'' said Pro Bowl cornerback Joe Haden. ''J.G., he loves football and he's really, really good at it. He can't wait to get back out here and start playing again.''Haden knows what having a weapon like Gordon can do for Cleveland' offense and to opposing defenses.''We're super excited,'' Haden said. ''When you have a player of his caliber, man, just to be a deep threat and even if the ball's not going to him, you have to be worried about him. You can't really load up boxes because you can't just put one corner over there with Josh.''You have to pay more attention to him. So just being able to open up the offense and having a big, deep vertical threat of somebody like him is amazing.''---Online: http://pro32.ap.org/poll and http://twitter.com/AP-NFL

http://www.aol.com/article/2014/10/31/satanic-coloring-book-under-review-in-florida-school-district/20987017/	Satanic coloring book under review in Florida school district	Educators in Orange County, Florida, are reviewing a new coloring book before it's placed in schools. It's called "The Satanic Children's Big Book of Activities."The group leading the charge to get it into schools is the Satanic Temple. The book features children in traditional Satanic rituals, along with pentagram imagery, Cerberus the Dog, and a maze leading to a spell book, the Necronomicon. The book also contains anti-bullying messages.If the Orange County school district approves the content of the book, it will be legal to distribute it to students. According to district policy, any approved religious material can be distributed to schools.The policy originally allowed Bible distributions on school grounds, and they're still there. But this set off a barrage of lawsuits by activists for the separation of church and state.A judge dismissed a recent case in January but left the policy open to grant all religious affiliations the same access -- pending district approval.Since then, the school board has allowed atheist groups to distribute materials in high schools -- groups that threatened to sue Orange County for violating first amendment rights. A member told WTFV last year, "None of these religious materials should be distributed. None of our materials should be distributed, but want to ensure that if the Bible or any other religious materials are distributed, ours will be there as well."It seems the Satanic Temple is now joining in to further prove the point. A spokesperson told the Orlando Sentinel earlier this year the coloring books would be placed "as a form of protest" against Bible distribution. The spokesperson said Friday, "They can't simply deny our literature because of its religious viewpoint. If the open forum for distribution goes forward, The Satanic Temple will be there."No timeline has been given for approving the Satanic materials. The Orange County school board has considered changing its policy on religious materials, but so far, there are no official plans to actually do so.

Words like, awe-inspiring, breathtaking, vast, incredible and untamed. Oh, and weird. Nature can be hella weird and anyone that says otherwise has obviously never watched a mile high cloud of dust roll over a metropolitan city until the buildings and all of their inhabitants are completely obliterated from the skyline. Seriously, just when we feel like we have things on this planet figured out, we see something else that makes us feel like we’ve never been here before.With things like climate change, water shortages and global energy concerns, sometimes its important to take a look at this cool, crazy, beautiful world and remind ourselves of what we stand to lose if we don’t take care of it. We want more than anything to preserve our wild lands, animals and oceans as well as birds that sound like ray guns and trees that look like they’re vying for the lead in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. Let’s face it, the wacky stuff is a cool piece of this puzzle we call life and we can’t get enough of it!1. The lyrebirdNative to Australia, the lyrebird is a natural mimic that can generate virtually any sound that it hears, including children’s toys, chainsaws and the calls of other animals.Okay, so saying these trees are carnivorous may be hyperbolic, but the phenomenon of trees growing around a stationary object is an amazing example of nature’s power as well as perseverance.Tumblr3. Mammatus CloudsIf these clouds seem ominous it’s because they are. Formed under extreme meteorological conditions, they are often a harbinger of a severe thunderstorm or even an impending tornado.The Fifth Corner4. Red-Lipped BatfishAlso known as the Galapagos batfish, this deep water vixen cruises around at depths of 30 meters or more and puts the phrase “trout pout” to shame.Divencounters5. Victoria AmazonicaJust when you thought that you’d seen all of the weird stuff the Amazon has to offer (You haven’t. None of us have. That place is wild),  you discover that it grows water lilies big enough to hold your kid.Imgur6. Danxia LandformsLocated in China, these land formations are comprised of sandstone and other conglomerates that date all the way back to the Cretaceous Age.Absolute China Tours7.

http://news.yahoo.com/boston-marathon-bombing-suspect-dzhokhar-tsarnaev-looks-17-213355158--abc-news-topstories.html	17 months later, Boston Marathon bomber suspect Tsarnaev back in court	With a slight, scruffy beard and long, tousled hair, accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev appeared in federal court today – the first time he’s been seen in public in a year and a half.The 21-year-old politely answered the judge’s questions in a final status conference, what is expected to be his last pretrial hearing before jury selection in his case begins in January. However, today a lawyer for Tsarnaev told the court the defense plans to file a motion to delay the trial.Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to a litany of charges connected to twin explosions that ripped through the finish line of the 2013 Boston Marathon, killing three, including an eight-year-old boy, and injuring more than 260 others.TIMELINE: Tragedy in BostonBoston Marathon Bombing Defense Strategy: Older Brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev Could Not Be ‘Disobeyed’Al Qaeda Mag Praises 'Great' Tsarnaev Brothers for Boston Marathon BombingView gallery Boston Marathon Bombing Trial Won’t Be Delayed or Moved, Judge Says (ABC News)Investigators say that he and his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, planted the bombs and followed the horrific attack up with a series of other crimes. Four days after the explosions, investigators say, the Tsarnaevs murdered MIT Police Officer Sean Collier, carjacked a Mercedes SUV driver, and led police on a high-speed chase in Watertown where a bomb and bullet battle erupted in the street. Tamerlan was killed in the firefight.Dzhokhar fled the scene and hid for more than 16 hours until his capture on a dry-docked boat, where he appeared to explain his motive for the crime with a note written inside, according to prosecutors.“We Muslims are one body. You hurt one of us you hurt us all," read part of a note allegedly written by Tsarnaev on the wall of the boat amid bullet holes. “Know you are fighting men who look into the barrel your gun and see heaven.”Court documents filed in March gave a potential hint of at least part of the defense strategy Tsarnaev’s legal team could use: saying Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was under the control of his older brother – “an all-powerful force who could not be ignored or disobeyed.”Michele McPhee is a freelance reporter and frequent ABC News contributor based in Boston.
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/12/10/u-s-navy-unveils-new-laser-weapon/21114511/	US Navy unveils new laser weapon	No, it's not "Star Wars" or "Independence Day" -- but it is certainly a step to the war crafts of the future.The U.S. Navy's Laser Weapons System, the first of its kind, launched on the naval ship USS Ponce early in November.The new weapon can neutralize targets with nothing more than concentrated energy.Christopher Harmer, senior naval analyst at Middle East Security Project, compares it to getting a sunburn after being out in the sun for 4 or 5 hours."That amount of energy being placed on a target in a very small amount of time is going to cause a chemical and physical disruption in the structural integrity of that target," he says.Though not as powerful as other weapons aboard a typical military ship, Harmer says the laser will have useful applications in fending off attackers. "If there are a number of targets attacking a Navy vessel, the gun is simply going to run out of ammunition before it engages all of the targets," says Mr. Harmer. "Whereas with a laser, you can more or less continually fire a laser as long as you've got adequate power supply and adequate cooling supply." Although you can't see it, the laser neutralizes a target by sending a beam of energy, cooking everything in its path. Now operational, the prototype laser costs just 0.59 cents a shot. That is a fraction of the cost of launching a navy standard missile 2, which has a sticker price of $400,000 each. While the U.S. Navy is far from developing the laser cannons of the starship enterprise, it has taken a first step to the future of military technology.

http://news.yahoo.com/trouble-brewing-south-koreas-plastic-surgery-paradise-023543421.html	Trouble brewing in South Korea's plastic surgery paradise	By Ju-min ParkSEOUL (Reuters) - Kim Bok-soon disliked her nose and fantasized about getting it fixed after learning of the Korean superstition that an upturned nose makes it harder to hold on to riches.While waiting in a hair salon, she saw a magazine advertisement for a plastic surgery clinic and decided to go for it, despite her family's objections.In South Korea, where physical perfection is seen as a way to improve the quality of life, including job and marriage prospects, plastic surgery procedures can seem as commonplace as haircuts.Kim's doctor said he could turn her into a celebrity lookalike, and Kim decided to take the plunge, taking loans and spending 30 million won ($28,000) for 15 surgeries on her face over the course of a day.When the bandages came off and she looked in the mirror, she knew something had gone horribly wrong. Only later did Kim find out her doctor was not a plastic surgery specialist.Five years later, Kim struggles with an array of medical problems, and is unable to close her eyes or stop her nose from running. The 49-year-old divorcee said she was unemployed and suffers from depression."It is so horrible that people can't look at my face," Kim, crying, said in her tiny one-room Seoul flat filled with photographs from before and after the surgeries."This is not a human face. It is more revolting than monsters or aliens."A record from the Seoul central district court shows that Kim's doctor faces a pending criminal case on charges of violating medical law. The case began in 2009 after several patients including Kim reported him to the authorities. The doctor's lawyer turned down Reuters' request for an interview.The boom in South Korea's $5 billion plastic surgery industry - that's a quarter of the global market according to the country's antitrust watchdog - is facing a backlash, with formal complaints about botched procedures and dodgy doctors doubling in 2013 from a year earlier.Some plastic surgeons say safety fears could stifle the country's nascent but fast-growing market for medical tourism, especially from China.Complaints range from unqualified doctors to overly aggressive marketing to "ghost doctors", who stand in for more qualified doctors and perform surgeries on unwitting, anaesthetized patients.Cha Sang-myun, chairman of the Korean Association of Plastic Surgeons, which represents 1,500 plastic surgeons, is worried about their reputation. Cha and some lawmakers are among those calling for tighter supervision and stricter advertising rules."We've got to clean ourselves up," Cha said at his clinic in Seoul's high-end Gangnam district, which is filled with plastic surgery clinics."Now, patients from China are coming in the name of plastic surgery tourism but if things go on like this, I don't think they will come in the next few years," he said.GHOST DOCTORSIn a notorious case last December, a high school student ended up in a coma after surgeries to fix her nose and get a "double-eyelid", a procedure that makes the eyes look bigger.Cha's group looked into the incident and found the hospital that performed the surgery hired such ghost doctors, and referred the case to prosecutors. It is still under investigation by prosecutors and nobody has been indicted, an official at the association said.Critics blame lax regulation, excessive advertising and society's obsession with appearance for fuelling an industry run amok.South Korea is home to more than 4,000 plastic surgery clinics and has the world's highest rate of cosmetic procedures - 13 for every 1,000 people in a population of 49 million - according to government data.The boom is gaining steam, fueled by tourism, with the number of visiting Chinese patients tripling between 2011 and 2013, government data shows."Advertising too much has made people think surgeries are a commodity. People now think plastic surgeries are like buying stuff somewhere," said Cha, who has performed plastic surgeries for more than two decades."But plastic surgery is a surgery too, which can risk your life," he said.A Miss Korea contestant in the 1980s underwent breast augmentation in 2008 in the hope that it would boost her chances of finding a husband.Park, 50, who is divorced and gave only her surname, ended up going to the same doctor as Kim. Due to a series of post-surgical infections, her right breast ended up half the size of the left."I regret it so much that I tried to kill myself twice," she said. "Plastic surgeries are like an addiction. If you do the eyes, you want to do the nose. And doctors don't say 'you are beautiful enough', but get people to do more."(Editing by Tony Munroe and Tony Tharakan)

This longer bob hairstyle looks flattering on all face shapes. But if you're still unsure as to whether it's right for you, just take a cue from Camila Alves.The 32-year-old nearly made us do a double-take when she showed up at the "Interstellar" New York City premiere wearing a faux lob alongside her actor-husband Matthew McConaughey. While she went right back to her signature loose locks, we think Alves could definitely pull off a shorter 'do.Check it out for yourself below and see which other celebs made this week's best and worst beauty list.BEST: Camila AlvesMcConaughey's five o'clock shadow is kind of sexy, but it's Alves' glamorous hair and makeup that really has our attention. The hidden hair part gives way to a lovely lob that frames her bronzed complexion.BEST: BeyoncéBey went back to this tousled, wavy bob that we love so much. And she knows how to keep her makeup simple, yet sultry with cat eyeliner and nude-pink lip gloss.BEST: Anne HathawayThe Academy Award-winning actress made a strong comeback on this week's beauty list with a retro-inspired lob, subtle smokey eye makeup and cherry red lipstick.BEST: Miranda LambertLambert had one of the BEST beauty looks at this year's CMA Awards. We just can't stop staring at her shiny blonde waves, lush eyelashes and creamy pink lips.WORST: Kacey MusgravesWhat would Dolly Parton think of this bouffant hairstyle? While Musgraves' makeup is absolutely flawless, this big hairstyle is a total distraction.WORST: Danielle de NieseThe lyric soprano's heavy eyeliner and unflattering red-orange lipstick ages her well beyond her 35 years.

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/guy-fixed-overheating-macbook-pro-200000185.html	A Guy Fixed His Overheating MacBook Pro By Putting It In The Oven And Baking It At 170 Degrees	A man managed to fix his struggling MacBook Pro by putting it in the oven and baking it.Sterling Hirsh, a programmer for tech website iFixit, published an article on Dec. 29 chronicling his trials and tribulations over the last year with his MacBook Pro and the outlandish method that he used to try to fix it.According to the post, Hirsh started noticing "heat issues" about a year ago. He explains that his particular model of MacBook Pro is notorious for running too hot. And because of his job, as well as his love for games and electronic music, he uses his laptop a lot.Hirsh says he tried a few "simple fixes" on the MacBook to tackle the problem. He blew out the inside of it with compressed air, bought a laptop stand, and enabled a program that allows its fans to be run at maximum speed all the time.But all of his efforts were fruitless: his beloved MacBook eventually died.Hirsh recalls:I was working on it when the screen suddenly went black. When I powered it off and on again, the power light lit, but I got no boot chime and the screen alternated between glitchy and black — it all screamed that something on the logic board was busted. Probably the water-boiling temperatures had caused the board to flex, knocking solder loose from its ball grid arrays. The likely fix? Reflow it: Heat it up until the balls of solder melt back into their assigned spots.So Hirsh took drastic measures. Instead of sending his laptop off for repair (which can take a while), he decided to take it apart, disconnect some of the parts from the logic board, and turn the oven up to 170 degrees C. He applied some thermal paste (something that can be purchased in most hardware stores) placed it on a cookie sheet, and baked it for seven "nerveracking" minutes, he says.And guess what? It worked!"After it cooled, I reapplied thermal paste, put it all back together, and cheered when it booted. It ran great for the next eight months," Hirsh says."The speed holes worked," Hamish declares. "The boot chime rang. The screen glowed. The fans blew."But that wasn't the end of Hirsh's troubles. In the same post, he says that his laptop died 2 weeks ago. He tried all sorts of weird ways to bring it back to life. He used more thermal paste, a heat gun, and aluminium foil to doctor troublesome areas.It all ended up with Hirsh putting his MacBook back in the oven, this time for for 7 minutes and 30 seconds. It was then he decided to "drill 60 holes in the bottom case, under the fans," he explains.It was fixed."The speed holes worked," Hamish declares. "The boot chime rang. The screen glowed. The fans blew."And worked well:There’s noticeably increased airflow—when I put a piece of paper on the bottom of the computer, it sticks to the case. Its average temperature is down in the 40s and 50s, lower than it’s been since before March.It’s a little early for a final verdict, but the computer has now been running without incident for fifteen days. Unconventional electronics repair tools they may be, but that’s how I saved my MacBook Pro with a drill and an oven.We applaud Hirsh's efforts, but should note that while tech support people have special ovens to fix chips, it's not a normal practice to put your laptop in a domestic oven. Proceed with caution, better yet, talk to Apple first if you're having issues with your laptop.More From Business InsiderApple Now Allows European Customers Up To 14 Days To Return A Digital Purchase 'Without Giving Any Reason,' And That Could Spell Trouble For App Developers Here's The Problem With Apple's iPad Strategy For Businesses The 10 Most Popular Apps Of 2014
http://www.examiner.com/article/mh370-passengers-disappeared-by-high-tech-hacker	MH370 passengers disappeared by high-tech hacker	Missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 mystery unraveling with expert and pilots' investigation WikipediaThe suspect who disappeared Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 and its 239 passengers and crew is a technical genius with highly sophisticated hacking skills, according to an expert's analysis released Tuesday that exonerates the Boeing 777's captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, just as Australia announced its commitment to continue its search mission.Passengers, Boeing disappeared by sophisticated hackerSatellite expert Michale Exner has stated today that the entity who disappeared the passengers aboard MH370 on March 8 has "profound knowledge of how the Boeing 777 works" and how to hack the system."Profiling the suspect this way, MH370's captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah is therefore innocent, Exner who is independently investigating MH370 concludes," reports International Business Times on Tuesday.The mere fact that all communication systems were turned off implied that the suspect deliberately avoided any form of detection, according to Exner."Furthermore, the suspect displayed a deep knowledge of how international air traffic control protocol goes," the International Business Times reports.IBT continues that Exner highlighted that the suspect has a working knowledge on how to access the section where all the communication systems were and was able to manage all systems displayed sophisticated technical capability. Exner emphasized that shutting the ACARS reporting system down - only possible through the plane's cockpit - also displayed the suspect's "highly advanced technological ability."Through his simulation of a Boeing 777, Exner confirmed 'there is no way to turn off the primary power to the satcom from the cockpit.' This scheme is not even described in flight manuals, he said.'The only way to do is to find an obscure circuit breaker in the equipment bay [i.e. the Electronic and Equipment bay, or E/E bay, is the airplane's main electronic nerve centre,' Exner wrote.Pilots working with Exner one the simulation said that "pilots are not trained to know that detail."Meanwhile, Australian officials said Tuesday said the nation's commitment to searching for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 remains, after comments by one of the airline's directors suggesting the plane would be declared officially "lost" by the end of 2014, angering passengers' families.Malaysia Airlines commercial director Hugh Dunleavy escalated heated relations between the airline and the families of those aboard the Boeing 777 by telling a newspaper on Nov. 4 that next of kin would be compensated "once we've had an official loss recorded".The newspaper reported that Australia and Malaysia were likely to declare the plane lost by the end of 2014, effectively ending the search and rescue mission that began soon after the flight disappeared on March 8.Monday, next-of-kin activist group Voice 370 said in a written statement that Dunleavy's "unilateral declaration brings intense agony and confusion to family members and makes us lose faith in the search effort."Malaysia Airlines responded in a statement that the comments were an "expression of a personal opinion only."
http://news.yahoo.com/china-punish-tourists-thai-air-rage-scandal-031838363.html	China to punish tourists in Thai air rage assault	BEIJING (AP) — Chinese authorities vowed to severely punish Chinese travelers who threw hot water and noodles on a Thai flight attendant and threatened to bomb the plane after they became enraged over sitting arrangements.China National Tourism Administration said Saturday the tourists disrupted the flight, hurt other passengers and "badly damaged the overall image of the Chinese people." It comes at a time when the Chinese are traveling more but also becoming notorious for rough behavior.A Chinese passenger berated a crew member of the budget airline Thai AirAsia before pouring hot water and throwing noodles at her during a charter flight to Nanjing last Thursday. The flight returned to Bangkok and the pilot asked the passenger and her entourage of three others to disembark. They were reportedly upset after being told they couldn't sit together and even after a flight attendant helped them change the seats.In footage aired by China's state television CCTV, a male passenger loudly threatened to bomb the plane. He later said the attendant was scalded by accident during a tussle over a receipt they had requested for the hot water.After the plane turned back, the captain and the crew invited the passenger to discuss the situation and reached "an amicable conclusion," Thai AirAsia said.The Chinese tourism administration did not say what punishment the tourists could face, but the statement suggested that the travel agency that organized the trip could be punished for failing to offer proper behavior guidance and that the tourists should be blacklisted for bad credit.Many in China reacted saying they were embarrassed by such behavior. Even Chinese President Xi Jinping, during a recent visit to the Maldives, urged the Chinese tourists to be more civilized by not throwing away plastic bottles or destroying coral reefs.More than 100 million Chinese have traveled overseas this year, more than any other country.

He was wearing Nike gloves when he hauled the score in.The sporting apparel company has given the wideout a pair of Air Vapor 3.0 gloves with a silhouette of the amazing catch and the words "Beckham legendary" embossed on them.The were presented to him in a custom wood case with "THE CATCH 11.23.14" carved on the inside of the lid.Fingerprints are also embossed on the thumb, pointer and middle finger -- the three digits with which he caught the ball.Beckham signed an endorsement deal with Nike prior to the 2014 NFL Draft, in which the Giants picked him 12th overall. He is fast becoming one of the company's top names among a stable of A-list athletes.He had previously worn Nike gloves with the Giants colors and logo that are also worn by other wide receivers. The gloves come in pairs made to match the colors and logos of each NFL team.But now Beckham has unique gloves to match his one-of-a-kind catch, which many say is the greatest in NFL history.His legend only grew stronger this week after footage emerged of him kicking a spinning football for a 32-yard field goal during practice.The Cowboys may have won the pivotal NFC East matchup, but Nike doesn't make special gloves just for beating an opponent.
http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/11/21/college-grade-inflation-what-does-an-mean/3662003/	College grade inflation: Does 'A' stand for 'average'?	At some colleges over 50% of the grades given are A's. And while students may be happy, it begs the question: What does an A grade mean?There was a time when a C meant average.The average GPA at four-year colleges and universities has risen from 2.52 in the 1950s to 3.11 in 2006. And according to Stuart Rojstaczer, a former Duke University professor and founder of GradeInflation.com, GPAs only keep rising.At some colleges, Rojstaczer says, over 50% of the grades given are A's. And while students may be happy, it begs the question: What does an A grade mean?"In a fair grading system, you reward people for their outstanding achievements," Rojstaczer says. "It's a fair system for students who are working hard and are creative to excel. (Grade inflation) lowers the intensity and intellectual level in many classes."According to Rojstaczer, grade inflation began in earnest during the Vietnam War era — when students who flunked out of college were drafted into the army. Professors began awarding high grades to prevent students from being deployed.When the war ended, grades went back down. But in the 1980s, grades began to slowly rise again."It's top-down driven, because universities are more concerned than in the past about enrollments in particular classes," Rojstaczer says. "Departments whose budgets depend on enrollment want to make sure that their classes are full."Rojstaczer claims that students' evaluations of courses contribute to the uptick in GPA.Evaluations influence tenure, promotion and retention for college professors. Professors therefore often feel pressured to please their students."Students don't know what an A means anymore," says Christopher Healy, a professor of computer science at Furman University who co-authored studies on grade inflation with Rojstaczer."It has no particular significance except everybody agrees that it's a really good grade … It's an unsustainable trend."But grade inflation may help students succeed in job and graduate school applications.A study published in scientific journal PLOS One in July indicated that final GPA determined whether or not a student was accepted — regardless of the difficulty of the school."It's very difficult for admissions officers to make the right decisions when they're comparing candidates who are in different grade inflation environments," says Samuel Swift, the lead author of the study. "Even if they know about it, it's very difficult for them to discount it further."In the first part of the study, Swift and his colleagues asked college admissions officers to assess fictitious applicants for an MBA program. In the scenario, the candidates were from colleges of equal quality, but with different average GPAs.Swift found that students with the highest GPAs were more likely to be accepted — regardless of the average GPA of the school.Swift also found it was beneficial for applicants to have a high GPA relative to their undergraduate class, based on 10 years of real admissions data from four MBA programs in the U.S. It also helped to attend a college with a higher average GPA.In 2004, Princeton University introduced a policy advising professors to cap A grades at around 35%. A faculty committee was created this October to re-evaluate the policy due to student concern that grade deflation hurt their competitiveness for graduate school."There's no evidence to indicate that Princeton graduates are less successful in getting into graduate schools, professional schools or getting hired," says Richard Kamber, a professor of philosophy at the College of New Jersey, who has written extensively about grade inflation."It's not exactly draconian," says Kamber of Princeton's policy. "It was an act of leadership on their part. They were actually suggesting that other institutions should consider doing the same thing."Yale attempted to institute similar measures in the spring of 2013 — but postponed voting on the changes due to a major outcry from the student body. In the spring of 2012, 62% of grades at Yale were A's.Grade inflation does not affect all colleges equally.Rojstaczer and Healy's findings indicate that grade inflation is more pervasive in private colleges. At community colleges, Healy says, grades are actually going down slightly — with more students flunking out.There is also a large interdisciplinary gap in grade inflation."For fun, I took the most recent data I could from quite a few colleges across the country," says Healy, who examined unpublished data for 22 colleges. "The toughest subject was math. At the opposite extreme is education."Healy found that the tougher subjects included biology, chemistry, mathematics and economics — while education and fine arts tended to grade easy."For education, 71% of the grades were A's; in music, it was 67% A's," Healy says. "Contrast that with mathematics, where it's only 29%."Still, Healy believes the trend will continue — at least for the foreseeable future."To a great extent, the status quo is working. Students are succeeding," he says. "The problem is that time goes on, year after year, the grade distributions are becoming less and less realistic."Cara Newlon is a senior at Brown University.Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1c6cPgy

http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/08/04/fbi-informant-crimes-report/2613305/	Exclusive: FBI allowed informants to commit 5,600 crimes	USA TODAY exclusive: New documents show FBI agents gave their informants permission to break the law thousands of times in 2011.WASHINGTON — The FBI gave its informants permission to break the law at least 5,658 times in a single year, according to newly disclosed documents that show just how often the nation's top law enforcement agency enlists criminals to help it battle crime.The U.S. Justice Department ordered the FBI to begin tracking crimes by its informants more than a decade ago, after the agency admitted that its agents had allowed Boston mobster James "Whitey" Bulger to operate a brutal crime ring in exchange for information about the Mafia. The FBI submits that tally to top Justice Department officials each year, but has never before made it public.Agents authorized 15 crimes a day, on average, including everything from buying and selling illegal drugs to bribing government officials and plotting robberies. FBI officials have said in the past that permitting their informants — who are often criminals themselves — to break the law is an indispensable, if sometimes distasteful, part of investigating criminal organizations."It sounds like a lot, but you have to keep it in context," said Shawn Henry, who supervised criminal investigations for the FBI until he retired last year. "This is not done in a vacuum. It's not done randomly. It's not taken lightly."USA TODAY obtained a copy of the FBI's 2011 report under the Freedom of Information Act. The report does not spell out what types of crimes its agents authorized, or how serious they were. It also did not include any information about crimes the bureau's sources were known to have committed without the government's permission.Crimes authorized by the FBI almost certainly make up a tiny fraction of the total number of offenses committed by informants for local, state and federal agencies each year. The FBI was responsible for only about 10% of the criminal cases prosecuted in federal court in 2011, and federal prosecutions are, in turn, vastly outnumbered by criminal cases filed by state and local authorities, who often rely on their own networks of sources."The million-dollar question is: How much crime is the government tolerating from its informants?" said Alexandra Natapoff, a professor at Loyola Law School Los Angeles who has studied such issues. "I'm sure that if we really knew that number, we would all be shocked."A spokeswoman for the FBI, Denise Ballew, declined to answer questions about the report, saying only that the circumstances in which its informants are allowed to break the law are "situational, tightly controlled," and subject to Justice Department policy. The FBI almost always keeps its informants' work secret. The agency said in a 2007 budget request that it has a network of about 15,000 confidential sources.Justice Department rules put tight limits on when and how those informants can engage in what the agency calls "otherwise illegal activity." Agents are not allowed to authorize violent crimes under any circumstances; the most serious crimes must first be approved by federal prosecutors. Still, the department's Inspector General concluded in 2005 that the FBI routinely failed to follow many of those rules.The rules require the FBI — but not other law enforcement agencies — to report the total number of crimes authorized by its agents each year. USA TODAY asked the FBI for all of the reports it had prepared since 2006, but FBI officials said they could locate only one, which they released after redacting nearly all of the details.Other federal law enforcement agencies, including the ATF and the DEA, said last year that they cannot determine how often their informants are allowed to break the law."This is all being operated clandestinely. Congress doesn't even have the information," said Rep. Stephen Lynch, D-Mass., who sponsored a bill that would require federal agencies to notify lawmakers about the most serious crimes their informants commit. "I think there's a problem here, and we should have full disclosure to Congress."Bulger, long a notorious Mob figure, is facing murder and racketeering charges in federal court in Boston. Prosecutors allege that he used his status as an FBI informant to steer police away from his own crime ring. Bulger has not disputed some of the charges against him, but his lawyers insist that he was not an informant; the former crime boss on Friday called the case "a sham."Follow reporter @bradheath on Twitter.Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1eity01

And they’re going to become more stretched as the real economy justifies the slow exit, and all this liquidity is going to go into more asset inflation. So two years down the line, we could have this shakeout … 2016 I would say."His advice for investors is to be underweight US equities next year as stock valuations increase, particularly in the biotech, technology and social media sectors. Emerging markets that are heavy oil importers and will benefit from lower oil prices are attractive.Here's the full interview.
http://www.fastcoexist.com/3038362/these-on-demand-drones-fetch-your-keys-or-wallet-when-you-forget-them	These On-Demand Drones Fetch Your Keys Or Wallet When You Forget Them	While Amazon and Google try to figure out how to use drones to deliver packages, a startup in London is focusing on a different service: running simple errands between two people. Say you're locked out of your apartment and need to get a key from your significant other. Instead of spending an hour on the train or fighting traffic to pick up the key, you can dial up a drone on your smartphone and send it across town."Speed is one of the biggest advantages," says Rohan Sinclair Luvaglio, CEO and founder of Bizzby, the company that created the new delivery service. "Our trials meant we could get across central London in under 10 minutes ... the emergency uses could be life-saving, if you think about delivering EpiPens, inhalers, or when there is an immediate medical need for medicine."The drones also have a smaller carbon footprint than almost any other transportation. "The environmental advantages are clear, with the lack of pollution and reducing traffic," Luvaglio says. "Charging for the devices is very low powered."After calling up a drone with the app—which would instantly dispatch it from Bizzby's warehouse—someone could watch in real time on their phone as the drone flies across the city, at heights of up to 400 feet. A camera on the drone automatically blurs out faces for privacy. When the drone arrives, the app unlocks it to release the delivery.The drone can carry anything that weighs about a pound. "Our drones can carry unto 500 grams for the moment," explains Luvaglio. "This is to ensure maximum battery life and to enable our safety feature to return home should it encounter difficulties. As battery technology advances in line with safety and security, we believe the weight could be increased, but this would mean more challenges in legislation and further safety issues—the heavier it is, the more damage could be caused."Bizzby, which currently has an on-demand app for services like housecleaning or repairs, sees the drones as a natural extension of their business. The biggest challenge—as with others attempting to use drones—will be getting government approval to fly."The U.S. has invested over $5 billion in an air traffic control system that doesn’t cater for drones," Luvaglio says. "Getting this on the political and regulators’ agenda, and making it work across countries, is incredibly challenging and something we’re pushing hard for. In the UK we are pushing for a new drone bill to be debated in parliament so legislation can be drafted."As soon as they get approval, the drones will be ready to go.

Why wait till Memorial Day? Fashion experts have assured us that we are not breaking the law if we slip into those white jeans today!But there's a better way to get the benefits of white year-round -- by putting it in your body instead of on it! We're often told to "eat a rainbow" and we aim for the guideline that says the more color a food has, the better it is. However, color is just one indicator of nutrient content. Produce that wears white could be just as valuable. In fact, some white vegetables contribute substantial quantities of nutrients that we seem to be missing most often (also known as shortfall nutrients), like potassium, magnesium and fiber.Here's how to wear white in a way that is truly one size fits all:Cauliflower Getty Images Move over kale. This veggie has been deemed one of the hottest trends of the year. Along with the other members of the cruciferous family, like broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage and Brussels sprouts, cauliflower contains sulfur compounds that are associated with fighting cancer, strengthening bone tissue and maintaining healthy blood vessels. Mushrooms Flickr:dps Get ready for this list: Mushrooms are low in calories, fat-free, cholesterol-free, gluten-free, with barely any sodium, and yet they carry a wealth of selenium, potassium, riboflavin, niacin and vitamin D. Mushrooms are also hearty and filling so they can help you control your weight without compromising taste. And they're a rich source of umami, the fifth basic taste after sweet, salty, bitter and sour. They can help simple dishes come alive. Garlic Flickr:jimlightfoot26 In my house, all I have to do is sauté garlic to draw hubby and the kids to my kitchen! Aside from tasting great, garlic has been touted as being able to help hair grow, cause acne to disappear and keep colds and flu at bay. Its antioxidant properties can help boost your immune system, and to get the most out of garlic's active chemical, allicin, cut a fresh clove up and expose it to the air for a little while before you cook with it. Onions Flickr:lisa cee (Lisa Campeau) Chef Julia Child said, "I cannot imagine a world without onions," and for good reason. The anti-inflammatory chemical in onions, called quercetin, can help ease discomfort from arthritis, and quercetin's beneficial properties have been associated with a lower risk of cancer, heart disease, diabetes and a stronger immune system. Potatoes Getty Images Nearly all Americans fail to meet dietary recommendations for potassium (97 percent) or dietary fiber (95 percent). On an equal weight basis, the white potato provides as much fiber as and more potassium than other commonly consumed vegetables or fruit. A medium skin-on baked potato weighs in at just 163 calories, a whopping 941 milligrams of potassium and 3.6 grams of fiber. (A banana, also white in color, provides 422 milligrams of potassium and 3.1 grams of fiber.) Potatoes also provide vitamin C, vitamin B6 and magnesium, in addition to small amounts of high-quality protein.More from Everyday Health: 6 Foods Nutrition Experts Won't Eat 5 Surprising Foods that Help You Lose Weight 10 Tricks to Waking Up in the MorningEat Your (White) Vegetables! originally appeared on Everyday Health

Or 27,000 days. Or 648,000 hours. We spend about a third of that time sleeping, and that number hasn’t changed over the last century.  What has changed drastically is how we spend our time when we are awake.There are 168 hours in a week and we spend 56 hours of the week sleeping.  This leaves 112 hours for everything else.  If you go back 150 years, humans spent 70 hours of the 112 working.  However, how humans spend their time has changed due to the continued advancements in technology and human ingenuity.Thanks to the human genius, we now have more time to spend doing whatever we want.  But how are we spending it?  For many these hours are spent watching television.  According to recent figures, the average human spends about four hours a day watching television.  This translates to 28 hours each week spend in front of the television.How humans spend their time has changed over the last 150 years and thanks to technology and innovation, humans now have more free time than they ever have before.  However, it seems many humans have found one way to replace this time working with the television.  If you want to measure the progress of humans over the last 150 years, we have discovered how to reduce the amount of time we spend working only to replace those hours sitting in front of a television for almost 30 hours each week.[Image Credit: Max Roser, Our World In Data]This article was syndicated from Business 2 Community: How Humans Spend Their Time Has ChangedMore Technology & Innovation articles from Business 2 Community:Neil Degrasse Tyson Responds To Christmas Twitter Controversy Neil DeGrasse Tyson's Christmas Tweets Incite Religious Ire Mobile Marketing Trends for the New Year Enterprise Mobility Will (Finally) Flourish in 2015 Samsung App Helps Autistic Kids Learn How To Make Eye Contact

http://www.cnet.com/news/another-mars-mystery-whats-that-circular-island-in-its-lava-flows/#ftag=YHF65cbda0	Another Mars mystery: What's that circular 'island' in its lava flows?	Scientists are studying a fascinating image of an unusual circular formation on Mars and trying to work out how it got there.At least we know it's not Gilligan's Island. NASA/JPL-Caltech/University of ArizonaMars has a history of offering up unusual formations for humans to marvel at, speculate about and scratch their heads over. We've famously had the face on Mars (Elvis, is that you?) and more recently a jelly doughnut-shaped rock and an object vaguely shaped like a human femur bone. The latest find is a formation that looks a bit like a deformed waffle.An image captured by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter looked down onto what NASA describes as an "enigmatic landform." The 1.2-mile wide feature is circular and sits in the Athabasca region of Mars, home to some of the planet's youngest lava flows. The smooth areas around it are those lava flows.Overzealous alien theorists might see the photo as evidence of intelligent breakfast on Mars, but NASA scientists are offering up a more probable explanation: "Perhaps lava has intruded underneath this mound and pushed it up from beneath. It looks as if material is missing from the mound, so it is also possible that there was a significant amount of ice in the mound that was driven out by the heat of the lava."NASA goes on to note that there are many features like this one in the region that are still puzzling to scientists. The search for a complete explanation is still ongoing.As we wait for the scientists to study this image and others of the surrounding area, I would like to offer up my own whacked-out, completely fictional theory: If the "Face on Mars" really is Elvis, then this circular formation could be proof that Elvis is hungry. After all, a Google search for "Elvis waffles" returns 407,000 results, so there must be some sort of correlation there, right?

http://www.examiner.com/article/pregnant-beggar-drives-mercedes-away-after-begging-with-her-son-viewers	Pregnant beggar drives Mercedes away after begging with her son: Angers viewers	Play A woman in California was heartbroken when she saw a pregnant mother begging for money on a street corner, but then she saw something that turned her sympathy into outrage. on.aol.comA pregnant beggar drives off in a Mercedes after begging for money in a shopping center and the incident has ignited outrage among many. Team 10 reported on Nov. 11 that a viewer contacted them after she watched the pregnant beggar and a boy beg for money in a shopping center and then drive away in a Mercedes Benz. "She sits there with the sign. He goes and parks the Mercedes, Melissa Smith, who witnessed the incident, said. "They put up the sign, and not less than five minutes here she is getting money from all these people ... They were leaving and I noticed they were getting into a Mercedes Benz. I thought, 'Wow! A Mercedes Benz?'"According to Smith, the woman held a cardboard sign that said "please help" on the front. Smith also told reporters that she saw several people give the pregnant beggar and the boy, who is believed to her son, money within five minutes. "Lots of people gave them money,” Smith said.Smith said she was getting gas when she saw the duo at their usual spot in the plaza. As she was pumping gas, Smith says she spotted the pregnant beggar and the little boy get into a Mercedes Benz. "I thought, 'Wow, a Mercedes Benz. It's not even used -- it's not old. It's a new Benz,'' Smith expressedSmith said she took pictures of the car and license plate and watched them drive to another shopping plaza. "They drive down to the other McDonald’s,” Smith said. “She sits there with the sign. He goes and parks the Mercedes. Not less than 5 minutes here she is getting money from all these people."According to AOL, when the woman took out her sign again, Smith started taking pictures and that's when things got ugly. "She picks up this big boulder about this big, goes over her head. I don't know if pregnant people can do that? but it was pretty big over her head and coming at me with this rock."Smith said she wasn't hurt in the altercation and the local news station was able to trace the license plate back to a woman who lives in apartment complex that costs $2,400 a month. As of the time of this report, police have not arrested the woman and she has not been reported by anyone else since Smith’s encounter with the pregnant beggar.
http://www.thenation.com/article/what-roger-ailes-really-thinks-of-donald-trump/	What Roger Ailes Really Thinks of Donald Trump	The Fox presidential debate on August 6 was an unadulterated triumph for the president—nay, king—of right-wing America: Roger Ailes.Consider the challenges that the Republican Party faced going into the debate. First and foremost, the front-runner is a racist, misogynist egomaniac. Such qualities might appeal to the Tea Party base—demonstrating that hatred and resentment are really all its supporters want in a candidate—but Donald Trump could never win a general election. And most Republicans would not vote for someone who supported Hillary Clinton’s Senate candidacy and Canadian-style single-payer healthcare, among other heresies. What’s more, the two candidates I suspect have the best chance to beat Clinton were looking like also-rans. Despite his far-right platform, Marco Rubio communicates Kennedyesque youth and charisma, with the added value of a Latino background. But he was running well behind Trump, Jeb Bush, and Scott Walker almost everywhere. And John Kasich, the popular, effective, and surprisingly sane-for-a-Republican governor of Ohio, was polling so badly he barely qualified for inclusion in the debate. (He may not have qualified at all, according to a fair count, but Ailes never revealed his methodology for choosing among the bottom-dwellers.)Rubio and Kasich “won” the debate, at least according to the pundits. Peggy Noonan called Rubio’s performance “fresh, crisp and poised,” and The New York Times’s Nate Cohn described him as “the debate’s top performer.” E.J. Dionne accurately termed Kasich “‘compassionate conservatism’ come back to life,” and on Meet the Press, Chuck Todd called him one of the “big winners of Thursday’s debate.” Time compared him to the pope.Ailes engineered these results by having his hosts ask questions designed to elicit them. As Michael Tomasky noted at The Daily Beast, “Seven of Trump’s eight questions could fairly be called confrontational or at least challenging. Five of Bush’s six were the same; maybe all six. Three of Walker’s seven. And just one or at most two of Rubio’s. And even those were only mildly so.” Kasich, meanwhile, benefited not only from his home-court advantage—and sustained applause for answers that would have brought boos in a Tea Party–dominated audience—but also from similarly sympathetic questioning.Ratings were through the roof. With more than 24 million viewers, the debate was seen by more than three times as many people as any previous primary debate and more than almost any other cable show ever, not including sports. But boosting ratings and support for the party’s best candidates were second-order ambitions for King Roger. The first was to destroy Donald Trump. (Fox had been championing Trump before the debate, but Roger can build them up and Roger can tear them down.) Ailes set out to accomplish this task in stages. First, the moderators asked Trump whether he would promise to support the GOP’s nominee without reservation; he would not. Second, the moderators, especially Megyn Kelly, asked a series of hostile questions—with even more hostile follow-ups—that goaded the buffoonish billionaire into responding with dishonest and dismissive answers. Inarguably, Trump was set up to implode on contact.Others fell into similar traps. Chris Christie told a fantastic story about his emotional reaction to having been New Jersey’s US Attorney on 9/11—even though Bush did not nominate him until months later. Rubio insisted he “never advocated” exceptions to abortion restrictions—even though he cosponsored legislation with exceptions for rape, incest, and cases where the mother’s life is in danger. I could go on, but truth was hardly the point here.Ailes’s final triumph was to burnish the brand of Fox News and cement his status as the ultimate arbiter of the party’s ticket and platform, while communicating the opposite notion that Fox is an actual “news” network. Accomplishing these contradictory goals simultaneously ought to be impossible, but key members of the punditocracy thought Ailes emerged victorious here as well. Times pundit Frank Bruni practically put on pom-poms to write a column in which he congratulated the moderators for asking all the right questions, particularly about the possibility of a third-party run. Using the language of a scorned lover, Bruni could not have been any more offended by Trump’s answer if he were chairman of the Republican Party. “Trump was undressed and unmasked,” he wrote, “and he stood there as the unprincipled, naked egomaniac that he is.” Bruni, who found the whole spectacle “riveting” and “admirable,” felt compelled “to write a cluster of words I never imagined writing: hooray for Fox News.”How odd to note, therefore, that Fox did not even attempt to create a forum for the candidates to address America’s most pressing problems. The moderators did not ask a single question about global warming, economic inequality, the denial of voting rights, mass incarceration, workers’ rights, parental and sick leave, a living wage, or any of the issues that might concern a normal person choosing his or her president. When the candidates did take a stand, most of them took positions so extreme that they put themselves in a tiny minority of Americans. For instance, Rubio’s and Walker’s “no abortions, no exceptions” argument is opposed by three-quarters of the electorate and 65 percent of Republicans. And not many Americans share Ben Carson’s view that avoiding torture in war is a matter of “political correctness.” (Though it would surprise no one, I’m guessing, if Roger Ailes does.)In the aftermath of the debate, Trump shocked the pundits once again by turning Fox’s audience against it and forcing Ailes to sue for peace. Sure, he calls Mexicans “murderers,” mocks John McCain’s time in a POW camp, and makes misogynist comments in response to accusations of misogyny. But every time the pundits predict his demise, the polls push him higher and higher. Could it be that Ailes and company—cheered on by the likes of Bruni et al.—have created a Frankenstein (or, more accurately, a Fox-enstein)? Hooray, indeed.
http://news.yahoo.com/killings-2-york-officers-trigger-backlash-201106309.html	Killings of 2 New York officers trigger backlash	NEW YORK (AP) — Civil rights leaders Sunday condemned the ambush killings of two New York police officers and expressed fear that the backlash over the bloodshed could derail the protest movement that has grown out of the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner.In the raw hours following the killing of the officers, police union officials and politicians accused those who have protested the deaths of Garner and Brown of fanning anti-police fervor. Patrick Lynch, president of the Patrolman's Benevolent Association in New York, said there was "blood on the hands" of demonstrators and elected officials who have criticized police tactics.The Garner and Brown families issued statements repudiating the officers' killings, while civil rights leaders took to the airwaves to try to put some distance between the movement and the crime."To link the criminal insanity of a lone gunman to the peaceful protests and aspirations of many people across the country, including the attorney general, the mayor and even the president, is simply not fair," NAACP President Cornell William Brooks said on CBS's "Face the Nation."Brooks said the shootings were "certainly not a step forward" for the movement.Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu were gunned down at close range in their patrol car in Brooklyn on Saturday by Ismaaiyl Brinsley, who then committed suicide. Before the attack, Brinsley, 28, wrote on an Instagram account: "I'm putting wings on pigs today. They take 1 of ours, let's take 2 of theirs."View gallery Rev. Al Sharpton, center, speaks about Saturday's killings of two New York City police officers, …He used the hashtags Shootthepolice RIPErivGardner (sic) RIPMikeBrown — references to two blacks who died at the hands of police. Garner died in a New York City officer's chokehold, and Brown was shot by an officer in Ferguson, Missouri. Grand juries decided not to bring charges against either officer.In the wake of the ambush, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani lashed out at New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder. Speaking on Fox News, Giuliani said: "We've had four months of propaganda starting with the president that everybody should hate the police.""They have created an atmosphere of severe, strong, anti-police hatred in certain communities, and for that, they should be ashamed of themselves," he said.In a tweet, former New York Gov. George Pataki called the killings the "predictable outcome of divisive, anti-cop rhetoric of Attorney General Eric Holder and Bill De Blasio."The accusations stoked fears that any gains made in the protest movement would be lost.View gallery A man leaves flowers at an impromptu memorial near the site where two police officers were killed th …"We've been denouncing violence in our community," no matter who the target is, New York community activist Tony Herbert said. He said he worries that the shooting will be used to discredit the larger cause."It sullies the opportunity for us to make inroads to build the relationships we need to build to get the trust back," he said. "This hurts."Similarly, the Rev. Al Sharpton, who has called for peaceful protests, condemned "eye-for-an-eye" violence and called it absurd to blame protesters or politicians for the officers' deaths."We are now under intense threat from those who are misguided — from those who are trying to blame everyone from civil rights leaders to the mayor rather than deal with an ugly spirit that all of us need to fight," he said.Sharpton added: "There are those of us committed to nonviolence and making the system work. And there are those committed to anarchy and recklessness who could care less about the families of police or the families who have raised questions about police accountability."Irene Sundiata Myers, a black woman who was selling roses and inspirational words Sunday on Harlem's Malcolm X Boulevard, said that because of Saturday's ambush, some officers might think twice about pulling the trigger on black men."It will change the attitude of police across the country in terms of how they go about killing black men, if they begin to think that there's a possibility that there will be a retribution," she said.___Jennifer Peltz and Mike Balsamo in New York City contributed to this report.

The FAA even released a video this week that proposes best practices to help people "stay off the naughty list" as they play with their airborne gifts.Drones are no longer specialty items, they come in all shapes and sizes. From DJI's affordable film-quality options to Parrot's toy-sized mini versions, they've practically become a stocking stuffer. And looking at social media, it appears some people are having a lot of fun with them already:...even if they aren't very good at using them yet:10:40am and Katelyn already broke a plant with her drone and flew it on a house. Who even gets a drone for Christmas? It's a drone. She's 12 — Kels (@kelscampp) December 25, 2014It's safe to say drones were one of the hottest topics in 2014. "Drone porn" became a thing, and the FAA spent so much time going back and forth on how to regulate them that we might not have regulations until 2017. So it's no surprise that the issue of privacy is actually on a lot of people's minds:To my neighbors that don't feel the need to wear clothes outside, this is your warning. My brother got a drone.

Excited for the weekend? That's nice. Let's look at this list of men who make giant bags of money to play pre-recorded tracks in public and see if you still feel that way.Earlier this week, Forbes released its second-annual compilation of Electronic Cash Kings. Even though we buy the line that DJs are working artists, holy shit, these guys' salaries have ballooned. Last year, Dutch superstar Tiësto topped off the list with an estimated income of $22 million; this year, he's earning $10 million more, but finishes second behind the $46 million brought in by Scottish producer Calvin Harris. Skrillex's ranking has dropped from second to ninth-tied place, but not because America's dubstep demigod is earning less—his peers are just raking in so much more. According to Forbes' own methodology, Deadmau5, Swedish House Mafia, Afrojack, and Avicii have all nearly doubled their income within a year. Even if these increases come from production revenue, that's still a lot of cash.Compare and contrast the rising cost of OONTZ:1. Calvin Harris ($46 million) 2. Tiesto ($32 million) 3.

https://au.news.yahoo.com/world/a/29108989/beauty-queens-answer-leaves-audience-dumbfounded/	Beauty queen's answer leaves audience dumbfounded	The logic of a beauty pageant contestant has left audiences dumbfounded yet again, after a Miss Bolivia hopeful gave a nonsensical answer to an interview question.While they’re not exactly known for their eloquent and articulate nature, audiences were still shocked by Miss Giovanna Salazar's gaffe.Sadly, it wasn’t even a difficult question about politics, climate change or the global economy that stumped the young woman representing La Paz.Miss Universe attacks Donald Trump Beauty pageant queen kickstarts 'no makeup selfies' trend Miss Universe refuses to give up her crownThe host of the 2015 Miss Bolivia contest asked her: "What would you say to people who criticise and disagree with beauty pageants?"Video from the event shows the brunette beauty smile before taking the microphone and delivering a corker of an answer, which failed to really address the question.Miss Salazar took to her Facebook page to defend herself, after her incredibly brief answer started to go viral on social media.She said she was trying to explain how different people all have different interests and tastes and that it was okay if some people did not like beauty pageants.Miss Salazar joins a long list of beauty queen's who will forever be remembered for their less than ideal answers.Miss Nevada's Q&A failBrittany McGowan might not have been crowned Miss USA, but she was certainly the biggest talking point of the competition.Miss Utah confuses self with answerWe're not entirely sure what point this beauty queen was trying to make, but we're pretty sure this wasn't it.Beauty queen tries to win over Star Wars fansThis video is proof that beauty queens should stick to what they're good at.....baton twirling and bedazzling smiles.Beauty queen's controversial commentWhen Miss California was asked about her stance on same-sex marriage, her answer left the audience divided.Beauty queen's special love of sightWhen Miss Philippines was asked to explain which of her five senses she most valued, she found herself a bit tongue tied.Prostitute a positive role modelPoor Miss Ohio landed herself in hot water when she cited Julia Roberts' prostitute character in Pretty Woman as a role where women were portrayed in an "accurate and positive" way.
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/10/17/boko-haram-might-bring-back-our-girls/20980268/	Boko Haram might Bring Back Our Girls	In April Islamist militant group Boko Haram kidnapped more than 200 schoolgirls at gunpoint in the Nigerian town of Chibok.This sparked international outrage, and a campaign was begun to "Bring Back Our Girls." (Video viaChannels Television)And now, Nigerian military officials say they might have finally reached an agreement with the extremist group for the girls' release and a ceasefire. (Video via France 24)Though a caveat: The Nigerian government has said it's "cautiously optimistic" the girls will be released, but Boko Haram hasn't commented publicly.Which is part of the reason for widespread skepticism.BBC: "The news on the imminent release on the 219 abducted school girls, that's come from politicians. ... The fact that Boko Haram has been on the offensive ... it's left many people ... wondering if this is yet another promise from the military that will be broken."And consider this: Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan is up for re-election.Which is why an unnamed diplomat in Nigeria told The Telegraph, "He needs a boost. ... We're taking this with a little salt."Quick background - since 2009 the insurgency group has been fighting for a "version of Islam which makes it 'haram', or forbidden, for Muslims to take part in any political or social activity associated with Western society." Such activity includes what the group perceives as Westernized schooling - which could have been one reason for the April abduction of the schoolgirls. (Video viaThe New York Times)So to Friday's news - as CNN points out, there are a lot of unanswered questions."Here's what we don't know: how many of those girls could be returned because it was widely reported ... that many of them had been sold off into slavery or sold as wives."Voice of America reports the talks took place in Saudi Arabia - overseen by the president of Chad. And though there are conflicting reports on when the girls could be released, the outlet claims they'll be handed over Monday in Chad.However, according to CBC, "Agreements for that release will be finalized in another meeting next week in Chad."Again, as of now, there are few specifics on the supposed deal, which reportedly took months to negotiate. But as U.K.'s Channel Five notes, "For the parents of those school children it's a first sign, a first step they may be reunited with their children."
http://news.yahoo.com/hospital-says-medication-error-killed-patient-200501465.html	Oregon hospital: Medication error killed patient	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — An Oregon hospital is acknowledging that it administered the wrong medication to a patient, causing her death.Loretta Macpherson died Wednesday, two days after she was given a paralyzing agent typically used during surgeries instead of an anti-seizure medication, said Michel Boileau, chief clinical officer for St. Charles Health System. The error occurred at the organization's hospital in Bend."Tragically, there was a medication error made," Boileau said.Macpherson, 65, stopped breathing and suffered cardiac arrest and brain damage after the drug was administered Monday in the hospital's emergency room, Boileau said. She had come into the ER with medication dosage questions after a recent brain surgery.The paralyzing agent, rocuronium, is often administered to patients in the operating room while they are attached to a ventilator, Boileau said. Used in this way, he said, it's a safe medication.The drug the patient was supposed to receive is called fosphenytoin, health system spokeswoman Lisa Goodman said.The health system doesn't yet know how the error occurred, Boileau said Thursday. The investigation is looking at every step of the medication process: from how the medication was ordered from the manufacturer, to how the pharmacy mixed, packaged and labeled the drug, to how it was brought to the nurses and administered to the patient."We're looking for any gaps or weaknesses in the process, or to see if there has been any human error involved," Boileau said.Three employees involved in the error have been placed on paid administrative leave.Boileau did not say how the hospital figured out what drug was wrongly administered to Macpherson. He said the hospital is analyzing the patient's blood samples to confirm the initial findings.The hospital also notified the Deschutes County district attorney, who did not immediately return a call for comment. But "there is no suggestion or thought of any kind of criminal activity," Boileau said, adding that the St. Charles Health System has not seen a similar situation in his 28 years with the organization.Macpherson, a resident of the small central Oregon town of Sisters, is survived by two sons, Mark and Pete. They had called KTVZ-TV to bring the hospital's error to light, and the station was the first to report on it Wednesday evening."She was a beautiful soul," Mark Macpherson said. "Everyone she encountered, she'd ask a million questions to get to know you. She was a people person and she loved everybody."Boileau said the hospital staff also is reeling."For something like this to happen," he said, "it's devastating for her family, but it's also devastating for the hospital staff who are involved in this. People who go into health care never intend to harm someone."Studies show hundreds of thousands of people die every year across the U.S. due to hospital errors. A 1999 report from the Institute of Medicine put the number at 98,000 people a year. A more recent report published in the Journal of Patient Safety last year says the number is likely much higher: from 210,000 to 400,000 people annually.The studies don't specify the percentage of deaths caused by medication-related errors.

Their son had allegedly dealt heroin out of the house, and cops said the home could be seized because it was tied to illegal activities.Markela and Chris Sourovelis — who owned the house — said they had no knowledge of their son's alleged drug deals, as CNN reported. However, as unbelievable as it sounds, the Supreme Court has ruled it's Constitutional for the government to take away your property even if you're innocent.Under federal and state laws known as civil forfeiture, police can seize cash or property if they suspect it's tied to an illegal activity even if the property owner isn't charged with a crime. On its face, this practice seems like an obvious violation of the Fifth Amendment's stipulation that you can't "be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law."The Supreme Court has ruled otherwise. That court has issued a number of rulings upholding civil forfeiture, including one in 1996 that said seizure of an innocent person's property didn't violate due process. In that case, a Michigan woman named Tina Bennis fought the seizure of her car after her husband was caught having sex with a prostitute in it.For her part, Bennis argued she had no clue her husband would use the car for the illegal tryst. The high court ruled that didn't matter, citing the following case law:It has long been settled that statutory forfeitures of property entrusted by the innocent owner or lienor to another who uses it in violation of the revenue laws of the United States is not a violation of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.In its 1996 decision, the high court pointed to a bizarre line of reasoning it made in its first-ever decision on civil forfeiture handed down back in 1827. That case involved the government's attempt to seize a ship used for piracy. When the owner of the ship claimed it couldn't be forfeited until he'd been convicted of a crime, the Supreme Court had this to say:The thing is here primarily considered as the offender, or rather the offence is attached primarily to the thing.While it sounds odd that the government would want to punish "the thing," civil forfeiture cases today still reflect that line of reasoning. When the government attempts to seize property these days, it files a civil complaint against the property or cash. This leads to funny-sounding lawsuits, like "US v. Approximately 64,695 Pounds of Shark Fins." But for people whose property or cash is seized, forfeiture can be seriously disruptive.
http://www.theverge.com/2014/12/24/7448253/sonys-the-interview-site-accidentally-let-anyone-download	Oops: people are downloading and keeping Sony's rental for The Interview	It's been an interesting day for Kernel, the site powering Sony's digital rentals of The Interview in the US. Not only did it briefly buckle under the pressure of people hammering its site to watch the movie, but apparently it didn't do a great job in securing copies of the film, either. Those who spent $5.99 to watch a 48-hour rental of The Interview on their browser could simply share the URL of the film with anyone else. Worse yet, anyone who had access to the link was able to save an unprotected copy locally through a super obvious loophole, something The Verge was able to confirm from different browsers and locations.Kernel did not respond to a request for comment, but tweeted that it was "working on a fix as we speak," after the issue was pointed out.Kernel was one of only a handful of places to get The Interview digitally, a day before its theatrical release in the US. The film became available today on YouTube Movies, Google Play, Xbox Video, as well as Sony's SeeTheInterview.com, which Kernel powers. The film's public debut was briefly canceled after Sony Pictures buckled to a hacker group that threatened violence for theatergoers and Sony employees, as well as leaking more documents. Sony did an about-face this week, rescheduling the release and adding today's video on demand release as an unexpected bonus.Thanks Alec!

http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2014/11/11/tomorrow-humans-will-land-a-probe-on-a-comet-for-the-first-time-ever/?hpid=z5	Wednesday, humans will land a probe on a comet for the first time ever	This animation explains how, after a decade-long journey, the Rosetta satellite will land on Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. (ESA)In the climax of a decade-long mission, the European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft is expected to drop a lander on the surface of a comet Wednesday morning. But the journey is far from over: The feat of landing a probe on a comet's uneven, enigmatic surface — which has never before been accomplished — will take scientists from the ESA and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory a grueling seven hours.And we get to watch it all unfold live.Since its launch in March of 2004, Rosetta has flown by Earth three times, as well as making one Mars flyby. At one point in 2011, the spacecraft even had to hibernate. Flying nearly 500 million miles away from the sun (close to Jupiter's orbit) the craft's solar panels couldn't leech enough energy to keep it running. But in January of this year, Rosetta woke up — and quickly approached its target.Rosetta first spotted the comet known as 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko back in March. Since then, it's taken a multitude of readings of the comet, telling scientists everything from how it smells to what noises it makes. Most importantly, Rosetta had to select the perfect site for its payload, a 220-pound carbon-fiber robotic lander called Philae. Once stationed on the comet, Philae will take readings until the comet is too warm -- probably around March. Meanwhile, Rosetta will follow the comet's orbit until December.The separation of Philae from Rosetta herself is scheduled for 4:03 a.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday. While the public won't be able to see video of the separation itself, there will be live video from the ESA's control room online, and probably periodic images from the spacecraft. Once Philae separates from its mother ship, it's got a seven-hour descent to the surface.If all goes well, Philae will land at 11 a.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday — give or take 15 minutes. Of course, that's just when staff at mission control will see that the landing has occurred. Because 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is almost 300 million miles away from Earth at the moment, there's a communication delay of nearly half an hour.But even in the final seven hours of a 10-year endeavor, plenty can go wrong: Philae and Rosetta could fail to make satellite communication with each other after the separation. Since Rosetta is Philae's relay to Earth, a failure to connect the probe to the spacecraft would mean the robot was functionally lost.Philae's landing site isn't perfect, but it's as close as the ESA could get. (ESA)And even though the landing site, named Agilkia, was carefully selected, it might not make for an easy touchdown. "We're looking at the pictures of this comet and interpreting them the way we would somewhere on Earth, because we're just not tuned to understand what they mean for comet geology yet," said Claudia Alexander, the project scientist who's overseeing NASA's many contributions to the effort.The surface could be much harder or softer than they're expecting, causing Philae to bounce or sink on impact. If Philae ends up upside-down or sinks too deep into soft ground, it has no way to right itself.But even if the landing is a mess, Rosetta has been a resounding success, said Kathrin Altwegg of the University of Bern in Switzerland. Altwegg is in charge of the Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis (ROSINA), a tool for detecting the comet's molecular composition."The lander would be the icing on the cake," Altwegg said. "But we've been receiving data on the atmosphere of the comet since August."Alexander agreed. "Even during the descent itself we'll be taking readings that will move our understanding of the comet forward leaps and bounds," she said.The former Star Trek actor sends "good wishes" to the team planning to land the Rosetta space probe's Philae landing craft on a comet. (European Space Agency via YouTube)That isn't to say there isn't much to learn from a successful landing. "Right away the lander will take a panoramic picture," Alexander said, "And then it will dig into material from the comet and break it down to sniff out the molecules in it. It's really like a crime scene, looking for forensic evidence."The comet contains the materials that originally formed the solar system, frozen in time. By digging them out, we can learn more about the origins of our own planet."It's a look at the basic building blocks of our solar system, the ancient materials from which life emerged," Altwegg said. "It's like doing archaeology, but instead of going back 1,000 years, we can go back 4.6 billion."A selfie of Rosetta and the comet, taken from 10 miles away.

http://news.yahoo.com/man-dead-memphis-may-amputee-wanted-fla-164449228.html	Man dead in Memphis may be amputee wanted in Fla.	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — As a teenager who had survived a devastating bacterial infection that left him a quadruple amputee, Sean Petrozzino wowed those around him with his upbeat attitude.But last week, authorities in central Florida were describing the now 30-year-old Petrozzino as "armed and dangerous" and "a person of interest" following the fatal shooting of his parents in their Orlando home. On Tuesday, detectives from the Orange County Sheriff's Office went to Memphis to determine if Petronizzo was the driver who shot himself to death after being pulled over by police officers during a Monday evening traffic stop.Memphis police officers said they heard a "pop" sound as they exited their car, and then found the driver dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. A positive identification hasn't yet been made.Orange County detectives had been looking for Sean Petrozzino for the past week after the bodies of Nancy Petrozzino, 64, and Michael Petrozzino, 63, were found fatally shot inside their home. Deputies went to the home a week ago after colleagues at the school where Nancy Petrozzino taught second-grade became concerned when she didn't show up. Michael Petrozzino worked at Walt Disney World.Petrozzino had two prosthetic legs. A photo of Sean Petrozzino at a bank ATM on the day his parents were shot shows him without any prosthetics for his hands. The photo was released by the Orange County Sheriff's Office, and an agency spokeswoman said Tuesday she didn't have any information on whether Petrozzino used prosthetics for his hands.The South Florida Sun Sentinel wrote an article about Sean Petrozzino and his family in 2000 after the then-high school student recovered from meningitis, which resulted in the amputation of his hands and feet. The family lived in Pembroke Pines, a suburb of Fort Lauderdale, at the time.It would be difficult, though not impossible, for Sean Petrozzino to fire a gun without using prosthetics, said Doug Pringle, chief operating officer of Prosthetic Consulting Services, near Reno, Nev."It would be unlikely he could get something around the trigger," Pringle said.A phone number for Sean Petrozzino's wife, Cynthia Horne Petrozzino, wasn't accepting messages Tuesday. Public records show they had lived in the Orlando area, and most recently in Cobb County, which is north west of Atlanta.A former neighbor in Georgia, Jim Petee, said Tuesday he only recalled seeing Sean Petrozzino once and that the couple kept to themselves.States records show Sean Petrozzino formed a corporation, SMP Educational Services Inc., seven years ago with his parents, but the corporation was dissolved in 2012. Sean Petrozzino formed a second company, Trekkie Installations, in 2009 but it was dissolved a short time later.Wells Fargo Bank initiated foreclosure proceedings against Sean Petrozzino in 2013, according to Orange County records.In the 2000 article, Michael Petrozzino told the newspaper that he was proud of his son's positive attitude adjusting to his changed world."I don't want anyone to feel sorry for me," Sean Petrozzino said in the profile. "As much as I feel bad about what happened, I feel good that my family and friends stood by me."
http://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/talking-numbers/gold-is-doing-something-it-hasn-t-done-in-17-years-214340197.html	Gold is doing something it hasn't done in 17 years	Gold bugs are having flashbacks of the late ‘90s.But it’s not Hanson or “Seinfeld” on their minds. Instead, it’s the sobering realization that gold is about to do something depressing.If gold were to close out the year right now where it is, it would be looking at its first back-to-back yearly loss since 1997. The precious metal is currently off almost 4 percent on the year. The surging dollar and lack of inflation has taken the shine off gold. But with so much going wrong, could now be the time to buy bullion?“I think gold is headed straight down,” said CNBC contributor Gina Sanchez, founder of Chantico Global. She sees a stronger dollar, economic optimism and rising rates ahead for the U.S. all conspiring to push the metal’s price down. Add to that flat inflation in China and the potential of deflation in Europe and you have a recipe for cheaper gold.“None of those things are going to support gold,” Sanchez said. “You might get some firming in the physical markets but it’s just not enough to combat the outflows in the financial markets.”The charts don’t look much better.“What we’re seeing in the trend is that this can continue,” said Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer & Co. “We would be playing for lower gold prices. As pessimistic as sentiment has gotten, we think it becomes more pessimistic.”For well over a year, gold has been making a base, with support around $1,200 per ounce, according to Wald’s charts. But with prices falling below that level, that may have failed.“We see $1,200 now as resistance and we are viewing this as a resumption of the very long-term downtrend that started in 2012,” Wald said. “Until gold can stabilize, we see downside risk to $1,000.”The $1,000 level is significant technically, not just because it’s a nice round number but because it was strong resistance in the time between 2007 and 2009, said Wald.“It was prior resistance for a few years in there and I think that might be a floor here,” he said. “The worst-case scenario is gold can’t stabilize and the trend continues lower.”
http://news.yahoo.com/man-pleads-guilty-keeping-sons-filthy-home-171543527.html	Man pleads guilty to keeping sons in filthy home	DENVER (AP) — A father whose four young sons could communicate only in grunts when authorities rescued them from a filthy Denver apartment could spend up to seven years in prison after pleading guilty Thursday to felony child abuse.Prosecutors agreed to drop all other charges against Wayne Sperling, 67, in exchange for his guilty plea. He will be sentenced on Dec. 30.The boys were aged 2 to 6 when they were removed from their home last October. An emergency room doctor suspected abuse when the youngest was taken to the hospital for a cut on his forehead. The doctor noticed that the boy was unwashed, reeked of cigarette smoke and had bruises consistent with pinching.Authorities then discovered Sperling, his wife and the boys living in an apartment filled with cat feces and flies.Prosecutors called it one of the most horrific cases they had ever seen, but the state's child abuse laws kept them from pursuing harsher penalties because the children did not suffer serious physical injuries.Prosecutors said the boys are improving while living together in the care of their foster mother. They have never asked about their parents."Considering what they've gone through, they're doing remarkably well," Denver District Attorney spokeswoman Lynn Kimbrough said Thursday. That the boys are living together has "helped them in their ability to try to recover from the horrifying neglect they were living in."Sperling's wife, Lorinda Bailey, was sentenced last week to 90 days in jail and five years of probation after pleading guilty to child abuse.Detective Teresa Gessler testified in Bailey's case that all the surfaces in the family's apartment were covered with dead or living flies and that about an inch of solidified cat feces covered with urine lay beneath one of the children's beds.After they were rescued and given bagged lunches to eat, the boys acted as if they hadn't seen normal food before, Gessler testified. They patted the sandwiches and played with the apples. After an adult mimed eating an apple to encourage them to eat, they licked the fruit, she said.When the boys were placed with the foster mother, prosecutor Bonnie Benedetti said, they did not know how to dress themselves.Benedetti said they are still not all toilet-trained and their snack cupboard has to be kept locked to prevent them from hoarding food.The latest case involving Bailey and Sperling warranted felony charges because it was a repeat child-abuse offense. The couple lost custody of other children amid similar allegations in October 2006, after passers-by reported two young children playing in the street. The children mostly grunted and pointed to communicate, and officers found a home full of trash and rotten food.Bailey and Sperling pleaded guilty in June 2007 to misdemeanor child abuse.
http://www.businessinsider.com/divorced-parents-and-college-costs-2014-12	The Strange Reason Why Divorced Parents Might Be Legally Obligated To Pay For College	YouTube/Good Morning AmericaCaitlyn Ricci's parents on "Good Morning America."Can a young adult force her parents to pay for the cost of her college education?Maybe, but fair warning: If you try, you might be met with death threats. Just ask Caitlyn Ricci, who has wrung $16,000 out of her divorced mom and dad and has inspired broad outrage in suddenly nervous parents and throughout the Internet.That’s how much a New Jersey trial judge recently commanded the couple to cough up toward Caitlyn’s costs for attending Philadelphia’s Temple University.Everyone has a visceral reaction to this case, and it’s easy to see why. First, there are the lurid details of this story. Caitlyn left her mother’s house early last year. Whether she was kicked out or decided to leave is disputed, but the next time either parent heard from her was several months later, when they were hauled into court.In the meantime, she’d been taken in by her paternal grandparents, who are funding the lawsuit. (Not surprisingly, Caitlyn’s dad, Michael Ricci, has “zero respect” for his parents.) Oh, and Caitlyn’s lawsuit also demanded that her parents help her pay for a new car. (Denied.)There’s also the small matter of some $906 that Caitlyn claims was supposed to have been paid to her last year, a number that the parents dispute. That’s the subject of another upcoming hearing. Get the popcorn.Should it matter that there were cheaper schools available?But the story raises deeper issues. What obligations should parents have once children reach the age of majority? With the costs of college rising to absurd levels, should parents who can afford to kick in some cash be forced to do so?And if so, should it matter that there were cheaper schools available? Should the law care whether the family is intact? (It does, as we’ll see.) And should the undeniable fact that the parents and the young adult are estranged from each other affect the obligation?Some background will be helpful. Fathers — and, more recently, mothers — have long had an enforceable duty to support their kids during childhood. But with the exception of disabled children, that obligation usually ceases at the age of majority. Until recently, 21 was that age.But things changed — problematically for college students — when the 26th Amendment was ratified in 1971. By terms, the law only lowered the voting age to 18 — but as a practical matter, it led to making 18- to 20-year-olds adults for all purposes (except for drinking and running for federal offices, which may or may not be connected).The law zipped through the ratification process in record time (three months!), so presumably state legislators gave little thought to the possible impact on parental obligations. But the amendment came at a bad time for students who wanted support for their higher education: The number of 18- to 24-year-olds attending college more than doubled from 1970 to 2010. The upshot: Parental obligations ceased just as the need for post-secondary education took hold as a national norm.So why shouldn’t parents have to pony up what they can? Isn’t doing so a good investment, and a better way to help your kids than the historically common way of doing so—through inheritance?Maybe, yet states have held firm to the rule that the obligation to support your kids ends at the age of majority, whatever that happens to be. Unless, that is, the parents of the young adult seeking support happen to be divorced or never married. In such cases, about one-half the states—including New Jersey—sometimes make the non-custodial parent pay for college or other post-high school education. (Not for other stuff, like the car Caitlyn wanted.)Usually it’s the custodial parent who sues the non-custodial parent for support. But increasingly, as in the sad case of Caitlyn Ricci and her parents, custody and support obligations are more complex. That’s why this case pits daughter against both parents. In a bizarre twist on The Parent Trap (the one with Hayley Mills, please!), the case has united the parents, divorced for some 17 years, in anger and opposition to their ingrate offspring.*What justifies making a distinction between intact families and broken ones? Aren’t kids in both families in need of scholarship scratch? That’s what the Pennsylvania Supreme Court thought, in a 1995 decision that declared that state’s law authorizing college contributions by divorced parents only to be an unconstitutional denial of equality. But the Keystone State stands alone in this regard. (Michael Ricci and Maura McGarvey, Caitlyn’s mom, probably wish they lived on the other side of the Delaware River.)Most states find these laws perfectly acceptable, because the statistics consistently show that divorce leads to disengagement from kids’ lives, and that parents who would otherwise pay for college do so less frequently after marriages crumble. So the laws have a rational basis, and that’s enough.I don’t think this intact vs. broken family distinction is going to hold much longer, though, and in fact decisions like this point the way forward for all young adults to force their parents to cough up college cash.Combine an angry 19-year-old and a creative attorney, and we’re going to get some variation of the argument that “age is just a number.” The real question, they’ll say, is whether the young adult is in fact emancipated — not whether some arbitrary age has been attained.Given today’s texting-while-hovering parents and the impossibility of kids paying for their own college education, a broad ruling that majority doesn’t equal emancipation seems inevitable. And if no emancipation, the support obligation continues.OK, but why Temple? Why not a cheaper school? Say, one in her home state of New Jersey, where she’d get in-state tuition? It’s a good question, but courts have generally preferred to look at each case individually and not to generally require that every kid choose the least expensive option.Otherwise, it would be community college for all — a result McGarvey and the older Ricci might welcome, especially since they have a combined five younger kids from their second marriages to consider. But since kids in intact marriages don’t always have to choose the cheapest option, neither do the offspring of divorced parents.This isn’t over. The judge has ordered the parties back for a conference this coming Monday, presumably to get them to settle this ugly thing. And the parents’ attorneys raise issues that might get an appellate court’s attention if the case can’t be resolved. Can a young adult spurn contact with her parents while still claiming she is not emancipated? Can she force parents to pay for an expensive college that neither one of them even knew she was interested in?Well, at the very least the parents can see an end to this family nightmare after college, right? Not necessarily. There’s at least one case — yes, from New Jersey — in which a court ordered a parent to contribute to his child’s law school education. The chains of filial obligation can be hard to snap.
http://news.yahoo.com/heres-comet-317-million-miles-away-looks-landing-045911699.html	Here's What a Comet 317 Million Miles Away Looks Like to a Landing Spacecraft	Scientists and space fans alike held their collective breath today, as the European Rosetta mission's Philae probe landed on a comet for the first time in history. During those nerve-wracking few hours before landing, the Philae lander snapped a photo of its incoming landing site, revealing some amazing detail.The image from Philae's historic landing success is the closest view of a comet ever captured. It shows the rugged surface of the 2.5 mile-wide (4 kilometers) Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, currently located 317 million miles (510 million km) from Earth. The European Space Agency's Philae lander's arrival on Comet 67P/C-G was confirmed at about 11 a.m. EST (1600 GMT), making space exploration history as first soft landing on the surface of a comet. [Rosetta Comet Landing: Full Coverage]The new comet photo came from Philae's ROLIS instrument, one of 10 different tools on the lander designed to study Comet 67P/C-G in extreme detail. One of Philae's legs also appears in the upper right corner of the picture.Stefano Mottola of the Institute of Planetary Research at the German Aerospace Center and the lead scientist for ROLIS said in a press briefing that the image was taken about 3 km (1.8 miles) from the surface of the comet."The landing site is exactly in the middle," said Mottola. "And so we can confirm that the trajectory was correct and we had a safe landing. And more images are to come."The Philae lander arrived at the comet aboard the Rosetta spacecraft, which left Earth in March 2004 and arrived at the comet in August 2014. The journey included a series of difficult maneuvers and a total distance of about 4 billion miles (6.4 billion km), according to ESA.The image from ROLIS is the first in what is expected to be a detailed study of the surface and subsurface of Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. Philae is equipped to not only photograph the comet, but drill into its surface to analyze its composition.Comets like 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko formed more than 4.6 billion years ago, when the solar system was young and "unfinished," according to ESA. Unlike many of the planets and moons in our solar system, which have evolved since their formation, most comets have remained the same. Thus, comets serve as a sort of time capsule from the early universe.Previous missions have chased after comets in our solar system. The International Cometary Explorer (ICE) passed through the tail of Comet Giacobini-Zinner in 1985, and then through the tail of Comet Halley in 1986. In 2005, NASA's Deep Impact mission dropped a probe onto the surface of Comet Tempel 1, creating an impact crator and kicking up debris. This allowed the second, orbiting probe to study the composition of the comet. The Deep Impact encounter is considered a "hard landing" because the object was not meant to operate after contact. In a live webcast of the Philae landing, many representatives from ESA and other space agencies expressed their excitement about the event. David Parker, Chief Executive of the UK Space Agency said, "A simple way of summing it up for me is: science fiction has become science fact today. Or maybe a better way of saying it is: Hollywood is good, but Rosetta is better."Follow Calla Cofield @callacofield.Follow us @Spacedotcom, Facebook and Google+.

http://news.yahoo.com/children-playing-australian-beach-babys-body-035724624.html	Children playing on Australian beach find baby's body	Children playing at a Sydney beach Sunday stumbled across the body of a baby buried under the sand, Australian investigators said, just a week after a newborn was found crying at the bottom of a roadside drain.New South Wales police said they had established a crime scene at the beach in the eastern Sydney suburb of Maroubra after the grisly discovery on Sunday morning."A number of children were playing at the southern end of South Beach when they located the body of a baby in the sand," police said in a statement."Investigations into the child's death are continuing, however, the age and sex of the child is yet to be determined."Inspector Andrew Holland said the "very small infant child" was buried naked under about 30 centimetres (11.8 inches) of sand near the edge of some dunes, adding that the boys who found the body were just six and seven years old."The children were digging -- the child was buried under about 30 centimetres of sand," Holland told reporters."The two young children reported to their father who was nearby, who in turn contacted police."Unfortunately due to the decomposition, we can't tell (the age of the baby) at this point."Investigators were also unable to immediately say how long the body had been there, he said.Holland said investigators were looking through birth and hospital records as well as consulting with the Missing Persons Unit to try and find the child's parents.A post-mortem would be carried out to determine how the baby died, police added.Randwick Mayor Ted Seng said South Maroubra was one of the area's more isolated beaches, but that it was patrolled by council lifeguards and volunteer surf life-savers."To say that I'm shocked is an understatement," Seng added in a statement. "I cannot imagine the circumstances that lead to this tragic event."Last Sunday, a newborn baby was found crying at the bottom of a roadside drain in Sydney by passing cyclists, with police saying he had been in the 2.5-metre (8.2-feet) deep drain since Tuesday.The baby's mother remains in custody after she was charged with attempted murder, with the case returning to court on December 12.

http://www.aol.com/article/2014/12/02/michael-browns-ex-con-stepfather-under-investigation-for-inciting-ferguson-riots/21001737/	Michael Brown's stepfather under investigation for inciting Ferguson riots	Missouri authorities are reportedly considering criminal charges against Michael Brown's stepfather, an ex-con who has served multiple prison sentences.Louis Head, 38, is under criminal investigation after video surfaced of him telling angry mob to "burn this bitch down" following the St. Louis County grand jury decision to not indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson for the August 9 fatal shooting of the unarmed Brown.Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson told CNN that multiple people have been interviewed since that night, all were with Head when the incident occurred."Burn this mother***er down! Burn this bitch down!" The video showed Head screaming to an angry crowd chanting "f**k the police."Head reportedly shouted for violence about 10 times, even demanding a microphone to make sure as many people as possible heard his enraged screaming, the New York Times reported.Riots that night led to the burning of police cars and businesses, looting and other violence.Investigators have not spoken to Head, Jackson said, but that is expected to happen soon."We are pursuing those comments, and there's a lot of discussion going on about that right now, but I really can't get into that at this time," said Jackson.Head issued an apology Wednesday morning for the comments., according to CNN.The exact words of the apology have not entirely been made public, but, according to the network, Head insists blaming him for the rioting "goes way too far and is as wrong as the decision itself."Head is not the only one under investigation, Jackson previously told television and radio host Sean Hannity, according to CNN, but his actions are also under a microscope."We can't let all that happened in Ferguson and Dellwood and the community die," Jackson explained."Everyone who is responsible for taking away people's property, their livelihoods, their jobs, their businesses -- every single one of them needs to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law."Brown family attorney Benjamin Crump previously lamented Head's remarks in multiple media appearances, but explained them away as an emotional man venting during a time of anguish.But Missouri Lt. Governor Peter Kinder personally called for Head's arrest only last week, during an appearance on conservative radio host Laura Ingraham's show, according to CNN.Head's criminal record includes multiple drug charges and prison stints, according to criminal records cited by The Smoking Gun.His first charge came in 1997, a guilty plea for felony marijuana distribution. Head was initially placed in a shock incarceration program and then a five-year probation, which he violated and was shipped to state prison.Head then pleaded guilty in 2003 to felony narcotics trafficking and was sentenced was seven years in prison. The repeat offender was released in 2008.Head married Lesley McSpadden (Brown's mother) earlier this year, according to USA Today. The wedding took place before Brown was killed.The pair is also reportedly under investigation for ransacking a merchandise stand selling shirts and other items related to Brown. The robbery is believed to have netted them $400 in cash and $1,500 in merchandise.Michael Brown Sr., the slain teen's father, and McSpadden publicly called for peace in the days leading up to the grand jury announcement.
http://www.voanews.com/content/international-panel-says-urgent-action-needed-to-mitigate-climate-change/2454120.html	International Panel says Urgent Action Needed to Mitigate Climate Change	A leading climate scientist warns failure to act on reducing threats from climate change will have disastrous global consequences.    He said the science on climate change is solid and inaction is no solution.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is due to release the final installment of its 5th Assessment Report in a few weeks.  The previous report lays out the risks of climate change and stresses the need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere through adaptation and mitigation.  IPCC chairman, Rajendra Kumar Pachauri said Thursday the upcoming report will focus on the urgency of implementation.  He said climate change will create conditions for greater conflict as people fight over water scarcity or food shortages from less productive farmland.  Pachauri says massive problems will result from sea level rise and the risks for human health will increase.  He said the prospects of climate change on marine life are not good.“On the other side, I think we have a lot more detail on actions that can be taken.  Adaptation, of course, but on the mitigation side, I think we have some very clear pathways by which we might be able to manage the problem.  So, to that extent, I would say that the 5th assessment report in general and certainly the synthesis report, would be a document that gives you some practical insights into what should be done,” stated Pachauri. Pachauri said no part of the world will be untouched by the impacts of climate change.  Therefore, everyone has a stake in doing what needs to be done to ward off the worst.  He said time is of the essence and action cannot be delayed.He disagreed with those who say the development of renewable energy, as substitutes for fossil fuel will cripple the world economy.  He tolds VOA the economic impact would amount to very little.  Pachauri said the cost of the mitigation of greenhouse gases in 2030 would be less than two percent of the total global consumption.“That amounts to about .06% of the global GDP per year.  Now, clearly, that is not a high price to pay, particularly since this would eliminate some of the worst impacts of climate change.  And, what is more, you would also be able to realize a whole range of co-benefits,” he said.The co-benefits, he said, would include much higher levels of energy security, lower levels of air pollution, some relief for eco-systems, higher levels of agricultural production and, possibly greater employment.   Pachauri noted the U.S. state of California, which has been implementing energy efficient policies during the past few years, has had higher growth than the rest of the country and is benefiting from declining energy consumption.  The 5th Assessment report, which will be launched November 2, will be the last one of the IPCC reports before a global deal on climate change is to be signed by countries next year at a Paris Conference.  
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/11/14/fbi-opening-office-in-north-dakota-oil-patch/20994083/	FBI opening office in North Dakota oil patch	WILLISTON, N.D. (AP) -- The FBI is opening a permanent office in western North Dakota's oil patch to help the area deal with rising crime that has followed the state's oil boom. A few things to know about the office and why it's being established:WHY DOES WESTERN NORTH DAKOTA NEED AN FBI OFFICE?The North Dakota oil patch was once a sleepy and remote corner of America. But the oil boom in recent years - brought on by advances in oil extraction technologies - has brought tens of thousands of new arrivals to the area and given western North Dakota the nation's fastest-growing communities. With the growth has come more crime - and more sophisticated kinds of crime.Police have found themselves dealing with human and drug trafficking, organized crime and homicides.The FBI currently has satellite offices in Fargo, Grand Forks, Bismarck and Minot. But in expansive North Dakota, those are all long drives. Agents cycle into the oil patch, but local law enforcement officials have said that's not enough and have pushed their representatives to secure more federal help.The FBI doesn't open new satellite offices often: The last was in New London, Connecticut, in 2006, FBI spokesman Christopher Allen said.---WHEN IS IT OPENING? HOW WILL IT BE STAFFED?Staff for Sen. John Hoeven, who along with Sen. Heidi Heitkamp pushed for the office, said there is no firm timeline for the office to open. The FBI is looking for places to lease at the moment.Hoeven said he anticipates that the office will have four FBI agents, an analyst and clerical staff.---WHAT ARE OFFICIALS SAYING?"We aren't expecting them to come and save us from anything," said Williams County Sherriff Scott Busching. "We don't need saving; we need help."And that help needs to be longer-term than the agents who have rotated in up until now, he said."You send somebody over here for two weeks and we just learn their name and then they're gone," said Busching. "We got to the point where we saw no point in filling in some of these new guys because we knew they were going to be gone."Williams County Commissioner Dan Kalil welcomed the FBI office but said he wishes for the area to return to the way it was before the boom."We look forward to the day when we no longer need them, when the problems are gone and we can go back to the community that we were," he said.Williston Mayor Howard Klug called the area's local law enforcement agencies "the best" but said "they do need help."

https://www.yahoo.com/tech/s/real-reason-won-t-able-apple-pay-walmart-115042152.html	This is the real reason you won’t be able to use Apple Pay in Walmart stores	Most of MCX retailers, including Walmart and many other big names in the retail business, are not taking Apple Pay payments from iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus owners interested in using the functionality because they’re working on their own mobile payments app called CurrentC, which should be an exclusive wireless payment option for them, at least initially.FROM EARLIER: MCX retailers might cry uncle on Apple Pay sooner than you expectHowever, the Apple Pay vs. CurrentC debate revealed various details, including the fact that retailers might one day support both Apple Pay and Current C — one such retailer is already looking forward to do so. Re/code says that Walmart will not be ready to take Apple Pay payments anytime soon, and might never support the feature, as the retailer is actively fighting credit cards companies.The publication reveals that at the recent Money2020 payments conference, Walmart’s assistant treasurer Mike Cook, who’s apparently one of the “masterminds” of MCX, grilled Visa exec Jim McCarthy about credit card fees, noting the differences between card fees retailers have to pay depending on Apple Pay transactions, and revealing in the process the real reason Walmart is pushing for CurrentC payments.In-store Apple Pay payments have a “card-present” rate — the same fee retailers pay for actual credit card swipes, as there’s a lower chance of fraud. However, for online on in-app Apple Pay payments, retailers are charged a higher “card-not-present” fee. McCarty said the difference in fees comes from a difference in payment standards though the answer was not good enough for Cook.Walmart has figured out what to do with all those Christmas gift cards you don’t want“This exchange is noteworthy because it epitomizes the mistrust and disdain between Walmart and the credit card networks,” Re/code said, adding that it learned from Visa and MasterCard execs that such cards won’t be compatible with CurrentC anytime soon, even though MCX wants to include credit card support in its payment solution, and concluding that Walmart will never accept Apple Pay in its stores in order to avoid these credit card fees.A video showing the aforementioned confrontation follows below.More from BGR: These awesome free iOS 8 tweaks will make you want to jailbreak your phone right now
https://www.yahoo.com/beauty/the-only-three-skin-care-ingredients-you-need-104853983543.html	The Only Three Skin Care Ingredients You Need	Photo: Henry LeutwylerSnail slime. . Bee venom. These are just a few of the many, many confusing things touted on the ingredient labels of serums, moisturizers, and eye creams. If you’ve spent any time in Sephora lately, you know it can be completely overwhelming trying to shop for effective skin care. To cut through the noise, I talked to two top NYC dermatologists, Dr. Elizabeth Hale and Dr. Amy Wechsler, to get their recommendations on universal ingredients and products and find out exactly what should be in your skin care arsenal. Related: Can These Magic Light Treatments Save Your Skin?Obviously everyone has individualized skin care needs, but let’s go ahead and generalize anyway. Basic skin care should include protection, preventing and treating signs of aging, and hydration.  I knew sunscreen would be number one on both doctors’ list (it was, and they both reminded me how important it is), so I asked them for their top three products/ingredients after sunscreen. Both dermatologists agreed on the same three must-haves:Anti-oxidants: Anti-oxidants are both protective and preventive when it comes to aging. “Antioxidants are ideal for packing a super-sized punch against free-radicals to help protect your skin,” Dr. Wechsler said. “Look for these in your skincare products, and try to include them naturally in your diet, through treats like green tea or antioxidant-rich berries.”  According to Dr. Hale, free radicals from pollution and UV radiation can get into your skin and cause genetic mutations which can lead to skin cancer and the development of the signs of aging.There are multiple effective anti-oxidants: “Vitamin C is a popular one, because in addition to having antioxidant properties, it’s also a natural skin brightener,” Dr. Hale says. “It’s probably one of the most common ones, too. Truthfully I like formulas that have multiple antioxidants.” She’s a fan of Cindy Crawford’s Meaningful Beauty Crème de Serum and SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic. Related: Do You Need to Use Toner?Retinoids: Retinoids—like tretinoin and retinol—are skin care’s powerhouse ingredient, and one that has lots of research behind it. Retinoids just work. Dr. Wechsler recommends prescription retinol because, “[It] is a great anti-ager that can transform your skin, smoothing wrinkles, unclogging pores, lightening sun spots or discoloration, and improving the texture of the skin.” But it can also be a bit expensive and cause drying in people with sensitive skin, so there are effective over-the-counter options out there, too. Dr. Hale likes RoC’s retinol product line  and SkinMedica Tri-Retinol Complex. Moisture: Hydrated skin just looks and feels healthy. In addition to drinking enough water everyday, use a good moisturizer. “This is one of the easiest and most affordable anti-agers available, since a moisturizer can immediately reduce the appearance of dry or dull skin, minimizing fine lines and dull spots,” Dr. Wechsler pointed out.As far as specific ingredients, “I like ceramide a lot because it’s a kind of mortar that keeps our skin cells together. It’s a fatty acid,” Dr. Hale said. “It’s a really good moisturizer that best mimics our body’s natural properties.” You definitely don’t need to spend a lot on moisturizer. Dr. Hale swears by CeraVe lotion, a popular drugstore option.
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/10/25/cream-vocalist-and-bassist-jack-bruce-dies-at-71/20983983/	Cream vocalist and bassist Jack Bruce dies at 71	LONDON (AP) - Jack Bruce was part Mississippi Delta and part Carnaby Street. In his glorious heyday as bassist and lead vocalist of 1960s power trio Cream he helped create a sound that combined American blues and psychedelia to thrill audiences throughout the world.Bruce, who died Saturday of liver disease at age 71, enjoyed a long, respected solo career after the band's acrimonious breakup, but will be best remembered for his stint with Cream and for classics like "Sunshine of Your Love" and "I Feel Free."Much of the attention was focused on guitar wizard Eric Clapton, but Bruce wrote many of the band's signature tunes and served as lead vocalist. He also provided the intense bass guitar that, with Ginger Baker's explosive drums, underpinned Cream's rhythmic, driving sound.They had it all - commercial and critical success - until individual egos intervened and they disbanded, entering rock and roll mythology as the original supergroup: super-talented, and super-troubled.Bruce was an important member of the British blues movement, which saw bands like the Animals and Rolling Stones first imitate and then expand on the American blues tradition as exemplified by Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker and other stalwarts.Cream, inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993, played a mix of traditional blues songs, with long, often improvised instrumental breaks, and their own tunes. They enchanted critics and fans alike at first, but after two years some found their extended jams to be self-indulgent, with band members seeming to show off their musical virtuosity rather than trying to complement each other.Songs like "Spoonful" often lasted 20 minutes or longer, with each member playing extended solos that sometimes seemed repetitive.Bruce enjoyed a long career after Cream's acrimonious breakup, and in 2005 he reunited with former Cream bandmates for critically acclaimed concerts in London and New York City.Five years later, however, Bruce said Cream was "over" - an indication of ongoing tensions between the band members. Clapton had said the familiar problems were just beneath the surface during the band's reunion performances.Publicists LD Communications said Saturday Bruce died of liver disease at his home in Suffolk, England. He had received a liver transplant some years ago and continued to suffer a variety of health problems.A statement released by his family said "the world of music will be a poorer place without him but he lives on in his music and forever in our hearts.""It is with great sadness that we, Jack's family, announce the passing of our beloved Jack: husband, father, granddad, and all round legend," the statement said.Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi said on Twitter that Bruce had been his favorite bass player and greatest influence."He was a hero to so many," Iommi said.In its heyday, Cream sold 35 million albums in just over two years and the band was awarded the world's first ever platinum disc for their double album "Wheels of Fire."The band started out playing traditional blues tunes, but quickly added a psychedelic flavor that brought still more popularity at the height of the flower power era.But they broke up with little warning, in the midst of their commercial success. Clapton wrote in his 2007 autobiography that the band lost its direction musically and that "any sense of unity" had disappeared."We were also suffering from an inability to get along," he said. "We would just run away from one another. We never socialized together and never really shared ideas anymore."He also felt they were eclipsed by the arrival on the scene of guitarist Jimi Hendrix, whose trio seemed to break new ground with each album.Bruce went on to record the first of his solo albums, "Songs For a Tailor." He also fronted many of his own bands.He was known for mixing rock, jazz and classical sounds, and his songs were covered by many artists including Hendrix, David Bowie and Ella Fitzgerald.Bruce returned to the studio around 2000 to record his solo album "Shadows in the Air," which hit number five on the British jazz and blues chart.He was born to musical parents in Glasgow, Scotland on 14 May 1943. His parents travelled extensively in Canada and the U.S., and the young Bruce attended 14 different schools. He finished his formal education at Bellahouston Academy and the Royal Scottish Academy of Music, to which he won a scholarship for cello and composition.He left Scotland at the age of 16 and in 1962 joined his first important band, the influential Alexis Korner's Blues Inc., in London. The band featured drummer Charlie Watts, who later joined the Rolling Stones.Bruce was playing and touring with his Big Blues Band until recently. In 2012 he played in Cuba, and performed in London at the famed bar Ronnie Scott's. His 14th solo album, "Silver Rails," was released earlier this year.He is survived by his wife, Margrit, four children and a granddaughter. Funeral arrangements were not immediately announced.
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/11/26/black-friday-gun-buys-test-background-check-system/20999297/	Black Friday gun buys test background check system	BRIDGEPORT, W.Va. (AP) - Black Friday isn't just when shoppers rush to stores for holiday sales. It's also one of the busiest days of the year for gun purchases.In the U.S., there are nine guns for every 10 people. Someone is killed with a firearm every 16 minutes. And every minute, gun shops make about 40 new requests for criminal background checks on people wanting weapons.On Black Friday, the rush accelerates to nearly two checks a second, testing the limits of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System."We have a perfect storm coming," says Kimberly Del Greco, a manager in the FBI division that helps run the system, known as NICS.Much of the responsibility for preventing criminals and the mentally ill from buying guns is shouldered by about 500 men and women who run the system from inside the FBI's criminal justice center, a gray office building with concrete walls and mirrored windows just outside Bridgeport, West Virginia.Granted a rare glimpse into the inner workings of the NICS, The Associated Press was able to see first-hand why 512 gun sales a day effectively beat the system last year.By federal law, NICS researchers must race against the clock: They have until the end of the third business day following an attempted firearm purchase to determine whether or not a buyer is eligible. After that, buyers can legally get their guns, whether or not the check was completed.This clock ran out more than 186,000 times last year.The problem is the data.States voluntarily submit records, which are often missing information about mental health rulings or criminal convictions, and aren't always rapidly updated to reflect restraining orders or other urgent reasons to deny a sale. It's a particular problem on Black Friday, when so many background checks are done at once.There are more than 48,000 gun retailers in the U.S., from Wal-Mart stores to local pawn shops. Store clerks can use the FBI's online E-Check System, which federal officials say is more efficient. But nearly half the checks are phoned in. Three call centers - in Kentucky, Texas, and Wheeling, W.Va. - take these calls from 8 a.m. to 1 a.m. every day but Christmas.NICS did about 58,000 checks on a typical day last year. That surged to 145,000 on Black Friday 2013. They're bringing in 100 more workers than usual for the post-Thanksgiving rush this year.The call centers have no access to privileged information about buyers' backgrounds, and make no decisions. They just type in their name, address, birthdate, Social Security Number and other information into the system. On Black Fridays, the work can be grueling: One woman took a call that lasted four hours when a dealer phoned in the maximum 99 checks."Rules had to be stretched," recalled Sam Demarco, her supervisor. "We can't transfer calls. Someone had to sit in her seat for her while she went to the bathroom."In the years since these background checks were required, about 71 percent have found no red flags and produced instant approvals.But ten factors can disqualify gun purchasers: a felony conviction, an arrest warrant, a documented drug problem or mental illness, undocumented immigration status, a dishonorable military discharge, a renunciation of U.S. citizenship, a restraining order, a history of domestic violence, or an indictment for any crime punishable by longer than one year of prison time.Any sign that one of these factors could be in a buyer's background produces a red-flag. FBI researchers then investigate, scouring state records in the federal database and calling state and local authorities for more information."It takes a lot of effort ... for an examiner to go out and look at court reports, look at judges' documents, try to find a final disposition so we can get back to a gun dealer on whether they can sell that gun or not," Del Greco says. "And we don't always get back to them."The researchers must use their skill and judgment, striking a balance between the rights of gun owners and the need to keep would-be killers from getting firearms.Researcher Valerie Sargo says outstanding warrants often come up when they examine a red flag, and that can help police make arrests."It makes you feel good that this person is not supposed to have a firearm and you kept it out of their hands," she says.It also weighs on them when red flags aren't resolved within three days, which happens about two percent of the time, or 512 checks each day on average. Tacked to a cubicle wall, a sign reads: "Our policy is to ALWAYS blame the computer."These workers have considerable responsibility, but little independent authority."They won't proceed or deny a transaction unless they are ABSOLUTELY certain the information they have is correct and sufficient to sustain that decision," FBI spokesman Stephen G. Fischer told the AP.FBI contractors and employees oversaw more than 9 million checks in the first full year after the system was established as part of Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act in 1998. By last year, they oversaw more than 21 million. In all, only 1.25 percent of attempted purchases are denied. Denials can be appealed.People can get guns without background checks in many states by buying weapons at gun shows or from individuals, a loophole the National Rifle Association does not want closed. But even the NRA agrees that the NICS system needs better data."Any database is only going to function as well as the information contained within," NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam says.Del Greco doesn't see the states' data improving soon, which only adds to the immense challenge of getting through huge numbers of requisite checks on Black Friday."It's really critical that we have accurate information," Del Greco says. "Sometimes we just don't."

http://www.voanews.com/content/ukrine-voting-for-new-parliament/2496783.html	Exit Polls: Pro-Europe Forces Ahead in Ukraine Election	President Petro Poroshenko's political bloc, along with other pro-Europe forces, are decively leading in Sunday’s parliamentary election in Ukraine, exit polls showed.National Exit Poll numbers put the pro-Western Petro Poroshenko bloc at 23 percent of votes cast on party lists, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk's People's Front at 21.3 percent and a like-minded party, Self-Help, at 13.2 percent. The results mostly coincided with those of two other exit polls, conducted separately. The Opposition Bloc, made up mostly of members of the now defunct Party of Regions of ousted president Viktor Yanukovych garnered 7.6 percent, poll numbers showed. Right-wing parties, including the Radical Party and Svoboda, took about 6 percent each, while the party of former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko barely won enough votes to pass the five percent threshold needed for representation in parliament. The Communist Party, which had been a fixture in Ukraine’s legislature since independence in 1991, will for the first time not be represented. According to the poll, it garnered less than three percent of votes. Turn-out was estimated at 51 percent.The numbers should be enough to give Poroshenko a strong mandate to pursue a plan to end a separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine and carry out democratic and economic reforms.Speaking after exit poll results were announced, Poroshenko thanked voters for backing what he called "a democratic, reformist pro-Ukrainian and pro-European majority." Coalition talks are set to begin Monday.Although some 36 million Ukrainian citizens were registered to vote, millions in rebel-held areas in the east, and the Russia-annexed Crimean peninsula, were unable to cast ballots.Poll numbers, indicating strong popular support for democratic and economic reforms, are likely to further strain Ukraine's relations with Russia, which sees Kyiv's pro-Western course as clashing with its own interest. More than 3,700 people have been killed as a result of the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine, widely seen as having been instigated and supported by Russia as part of efforts to destabilize Ukraine. Moscow denies the charge. Daniel Schearf contributed to this report from Moscow.

I think it was more, her going, 'Hey, this is my life and these are my kids and my priorities. So if you want to come and kind of join our crazy clan, this is what I already have kind of built.' Which I find so amazing and respectful… It's one of the things that I admire most about my [parents], is that they set such an incredible example for kind of putting their children first and keeping a family together, no matter what."PHOTOS: Who Am I? The Celebrity Offspring EditionOn her continued friendship with Ashton : "I reached out to him when he [and Mila Kunis] had the baby, which is so awesome. I saw photos of her. She's very cute… I realized the other day, he was a year younger than me when he and my mom started going out. It would be like me meeting someone who already had three teenage kids, kind of going into that situation was crazy."On dad Bruce and wife Emma Heming's kids : "He's shifted into this goofy, fun, kind of demeanor. He has two little babies now, which is crazy to me! They're so awesome and so fun."On sister Scout's recent topless protest : "I had no idea [she was doing it]. She told me it was just one of those things where she was just walking down the street and she just kind of decided to do it… I fully support it."PHOTOS: Celebrity SiblingsOn sister Tallulah coming forward about seeking treatment : "When you grow up the way that we have and you have such attention focused on you… if you hide things… it does no good. So you have the power to help anybody, no matter what it is, from dealing with any kind of addiction or any sort of body issues or feminist issues. If you have the power to kind of talk to people and make people not feel alone, then you should be able to speak out about it."-- Jesse SperoCopyright 2014 by NBC Universal, Inc. All rights reserved.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/03/dwayne-johnson-journey-2-wrestlemania-interview_n_1260489.html?ref=entertainment	The Rock Talks Osama Bin Laden, 'Journey 2,' WrestleMania And His Political Future	2012 is going to be a very big year for Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. His summer blockbuster, "G.I. Joe: Retaliation," just dropped a new trailer during the Super Bowl. His 3D family adventure, "Journey 2: The Mysterious Island," hits theaters this Friday. And when he's not tweeting, looking like a living, breathing comic book character, or getting ready to team-up with Michael Bay, he's training to step back into wrestling ring -- where he'll main event that pop culture circus known as WrestleMania 28 (in his hometown of Miami, Florida).How does he manage to do it all? Moviefone spoke to The Rock about his upcoming projects, got him to trash talk both "Star Wars" and his wrestling rival, John Cena, offer some R-rated advice to his co-star, Josh Hutcherson, and hint that we may one day be calling him President Rock.Plus, he finally explained how he knew about the death of Osama bin Laden before anyone else.Dwayne Johnson: What's funny is they were like, "You got 5 minutes," and I said "Bullshit, it's Moviefone, we got ten minutes."That makes it all worth it, coming from this old-school Rocky Maivia fan. Wow, that's a lot of love. And I'm going to reciprocate that, because for you to be a fan when I was running around with a haircut that looked like a pineapple and a blue outfit with strings and shit hanging off it, wow.Well you can reciprocate by telling me how you found out about Bin Laden's demise before anyone else? If I tell you that, I won't have to "kill" you, but I'll have to behead you -- no, I got my sources. I got friends in high places and low places. It was a very interesting day; I'm proud of our country and proud to be American. The individuals who were there were proud to let me know. I knew the President was going to give his speech; I thought he was going to give it at a certain time and so I thought, "I think it's appropriate that I tweet 'I'm damn proud to be an American'" and keep it in that space without giving away too much information. And then I got a call saying, "Now the President will give his speech in a couple of hours." So we had about two hours of Rock tweets out there [Laughs].Between that, and playing Obama on "SNL," what will it take to get you to move into the political field? Right now the best way that I can impact the world is through entertainment. One day, and that day will come, I can impact the world through politics. The great news is that I am American, therefore I can become President. But don't forget: I am G.I. Joe.Man, that was a smooth transition. I can't wait for it. Paramount came to me with the idea of rebooting the franchise and bringing "Roadblock" to life. It is one of the coolest roles I've ever done, I was a big fan growing up. Bruce [Willis] is a legit iconic action movie star. We always talked about doing something together, so the fact that we could come together, kick ass on this movie -- every day was great to work with him.But looking to the immediate future, you've got "Journey 2" opening up against "The Phantom Menace 3D." How are you going to fare in that cinematic battle? "Star Wars" is a tough opponent; the only thing you can do is lace up your boots, dig in deep and say "bring it." Either way the audience is going to be entertained, but at the end of the day what would you rather have: Jar Jar Binks or The Rock in 3D?Well you know how to talk the talk, but what kind of action hero advice did you impart onto Josh Hutcherson? He's poised and he's ready, he's going to have a massive year between "Journey" and a little movie called "The Hunger Games," which I'm not sure if anyone is going to see. Nonetheless, the advice I gave him is this: [clears throat] Whatever you do, do it full speed, remember speed kills -- and go fuck some shit up.Then to go in a more sensitive direction, do you have a favorite "High School Musical" song from Vanessa Hudgens? Uh, what songs does she sing?"We're All In This Together" is something I've actually heard of. OK, then my favorite song is "We're All In This Together." Because as sexy as Vanessa is, it doesn't even matter because we'll be in it together ... That doesn't even make sense but as long as you say it confidence and bravado, I think it works.You're not even giving yourself a break after "Journey" and "Joe"; your next two projects, "Snitch" and Michael Bay's"Pain and Gain," seem a bit more serious. We just wrapped "Snitch," that was a hell of a schedule and we shot six day weeks, for six weeks in a row. That was a very intense role, but I loved playing it and it was an honor to become that man. Those are real events and real stakes between the U.S. government and drug cartels and a family.["Pain and Gain,"] again, unbelievably a true story. We're in pre-production, and we're all -- meaning my team and Paramount and Michael Bay -- crossing "t"s and dotting "i"s. I've known Michael for some time, this has been a passion project of his, he gave me the script to read years ago, I loved it and wanted to make it then. Unfortunately, we have a very small window of time to shoot it before I go off and film "Fast Six."Now with this incredibly busy slate of action movies, how are you finding time to train for a WrestleMania main event? You fit it in, that's what you do. I make sure there's a ring on location with me, anywhere that I shoot. I had a ring down in New Orleans, when I was preparing for the Madison Square Garden event. I have a ring down in Florida, a ring down in Louisiana; there's always a ring close by. In order to prep for WrestleMania, it's a lengthy training camp that requires daily work inside the ring because you can't simulate the physicality of professional wrestling.But is your opponent John Cena really going to be that much trouble? The only trouble he's going to have is removing my size 15 boot from his ladyparts.I think that's what a lot of people wanted to hear. That's right -- I'm excited about all the projects you just mentioned. I'm excited about WrestleMania; to be able to go back, team up with Vince [McMahon] and make a big vision like that come to life and create the biggest match-up of all time is very special to me. There's countless matches that have moved me and inspired me, and we're going to do something very special down in Miami, my hometown, sold-out Sun Life Stadium. Boots to John Cena's ass.Finally, playing a round of word association, if you were a movie producer, what kind of character would you cast these wrestling stars as, in their Hollywood debut: "Macho Man" Randy Savage? A great villain.Heir to the WWE Empire, Triple H? The small pipsqueak of a body, what do you call it?A henchman? No, because henchmen are big and bad. [Laughs] I'm kidding, guy's an animal.Soulman Rocky Jonhson? A pioneer.John Cena? The female lead.

http://www.aol.com/article/2014/08/11/vandalism-looting-after-vigil-for-missouri-man/20944705/	Vandalism, looting after vigil for Missouri man	FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) -- A candlelight vigil for an unarmed black man who was fatally shot by a suburban St. Louis police officer was followed by unrest as crowds looted and burned stores, vandalized vehicles and taunted officers who tried to block access to parts of the city.Streets in Ferguson upended on Sunday night were relatively quiet early Monday. Some debris littered the area but crowds had dispersed. Police did not respond to calls by The Associated Press asking for details of arrests, law enforcement and violence in the unrest.The tensions erupted after a candlelight vigil Sunday night for 18-year-old Michael Brown, who police said was shot multiple times Saturday in a scuffle with an officer. The investigation into what led to the shooting was ongoing.Several businesses were looted, including a check-cashing store, a boutique and a small grocery store. People took items from a sporting goods store and a cellphone retailer, and carted rims away from a tire store. Some climbed atop police cars as the officers with riot shields and batons stood stoic nearby, trying to restrict access to the most seriously affected areas.Deanel Trout, a 14-year resident of Ferguson, said he was convinced the troublemakers were largely from outside Ferguson and that they had used Brown's death and the vigil as an opportunity to steal."Most came here for a peaceful protest but it takes one bad apple to spoil the bunch. ... I can understand the anger and unrest but I can't understand the violence and looting," Trout, 53, said.St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley said there were no reports of injuries as of about 11 p.m. But there were scattered reports of assaults into the very early morning. Pat Washington, a spokeswoman for Dooley, said tear gas had been used. Authorities would not immediately confirm media reports of gunfire."The small group of people are creating a huge mess," Mayor James Knowles said. "Contributing to the unrest that is going on is not going to help. ... We're only hurting ourselves, only hurting our community, hurting our neighbors."County Police Chief Jon Belmar said that on Saturday, an officer encountered Brown and another man outside an apartment complex in Ferguson. One of the men pushed the officer into his squad car and they struggled. Belmar said at least one shot was fired from the officer's gun inside the police car. Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said authorities were still sorting out what happened inside the police car. It was not clear if Brown was the man who fought with the officer.The struggle spilled out into the street, where Brown was shot multiple times. Belmar said the exact number of shots wasn't known and that all shell casings at the scene matched the officer's gun. Police were investigating why the officer shot Brown, who police have confirmed was unarmed.Jackson said the second person has not been arrested or charged and it wasn't clear if he was armed.Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson told KSDK-TV there's no video footage of the shooting from the apartment complex, or from any police cruiser dashboard cameras or body-worn cameras that the department recently bought but hasn't yet put to use.Jackson said blood samples were taken from Brown and the officer who shot him. Toxicology tests can take weeks to complete.Earlier Sunday, a few hundred protesters gathered outside Ferguson Police headquarters. Some marched into an adjacent police building chanting "Don't shoot me" while holding their hands in the air. Officers stood at the top of a staircase, but didn't use force; the crowd eventually left.Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, said she didn't understand why police didn't subdue her high school graduate son with a club or stun gun, and that the officer involved should be fired and prosecuted."I would like to see him go to jail with the death penalty," she said, fighting back tears.The killing drew criticism from some civil rights leaders, who referred to the 2012 racially charged shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer who was acquitted of murder charges."We're outraged because yet again a young African-American man has been killed by law enforcement," said John Gaskin, who serves on both the St. Louis County and national boards of directors for the NAACP.Ferguson's population of about 21,000 people is almost 70 percent black. The race of the officer has not been disclosed. He has been placed on paid administrative leave.St. Louis County Police Department is in charge of the investigation, and Dooley said he will request an FBI investigation. The U.S. Justice Department said Attorney General Eric Holder instructed staff to monitor developments.

http://www.vox.com/2015/8/17/9165189/best-painkiller-tylenol-aspirin-advil	Should you take Tylenol, Advil, or aspirin for pain? Here's what the evidence says.	Welcome to Dear Julia, a weekly column where readers can submit everyday health questions on anything from the science of hangovers to the mysteries of back pain. Julia Belluz will sift through the research and consult with experts in the field to figure out how science can help us live happier and healthier lives.Have a question? Use our submission form or ask @juliaoftoronto on Twitter.What's the difference between Tylenol, Advil, and aspirin? Which is the best to take for pain?I used to take acetaminophen (usually referred to by its brand name, Tylenol) for the occasional headache or sore muscle, mostly because that's what we used in my house growing up. I didn't think much about whether it was more or less effective than any other type of over-the-counter pain reliever, and I suspect the same is true for many folks. Acetaminophen, after all, is the most popular over-the-counter painkiller worldwide.So I was surprised when I found out there's a huge gap between how pain researchers think about this drug and how the public does. More specifically, every researcher I contacted for this piece said some variation of what Andrew Moore, a pain researcher at Oxford University, told me: Tylenol doesn't actually work that well for pain. To be more exact, "I can't imagine why anybody would take acetaminophen," he said.Moore has done a number of systematic reviews on over-the-counter pain medications, looking at all the available evidence to figure out which ones work best for various problems. I asked him to describe the overall success rates for the most common three: acetaminophen (like Tylenol), ibuprofen (like Advil), and aspirin.Like all good evidence-based medicine thinkers, he was able to provide a very practical answer: "If you’re talking about aspirin in doses of 500 to 1,000 mg or two tablets, 30 percent of people get relief from acute pain. For acetaminophen at doses of 500 to 1,000 mg, about 40 percent have a success. For ibuprofen, in its normal formulation at something around 400 mg or two tablets, about 50 percent have success."Now, Moore was referring here to acute pain that strikes after a specific event, like a surgery, a cut, or a burn, but his message was simple: Ibuprofen seems to work best, followed by acetaminophen, and then aspirin.(Maridav/Shutterstock)For ongoing (or chronic) pain — a sore lower back, say, or the kind of degenerative arthritis that typically develops with age — ibuprofen still outperforms acetaminophen. In fact, study after study has shown that acetaminophen on its own just doesn't work that well for most people to treat this kind of pain, either."We found that [Tylenol] is ineffective on both pain and disability outcomes for low back pain"A 2015 systematic review of high-quality evidence, published in the BMJ, found that acetaminophen didn't seem to help most sufferers of chronic low back pain, and that it barely alleviates pain in people with osteoarthritis. As the researchers wrote, "We found that [acetaminophen] is ineffective on both pain and disability outcomes for low back pain in the immediate and short term and is not clinically superior to placebo on both pain and disability outcomes for osteoarthritis."They also noted that patients on acetaminophen "are nearly four times more likely to have abnormal results on liver function tests compared with those taking oral placebo."Other studies, like this well-designed randomized control trial of people with knee pain, have similar conclusions: Acetaminophen doesn't perform as well as ibuprofen, and it's linked to higher rates of liver problems.So what about the occasional headache? What works best for that?It turns out this is another fascinating problem area for pain researchers. Moore has looked at all the evidence for what he calls "infrequent tension headaches" and found "it is surprising how poor [the research] is and how little it tells us." Either the outcomes in studies are badly defined, the studies have too few participants to say anything concrete, or many people in the studies actually seem to have chronic headaches as opposed to the ordinary ones they're allegedly studying."Most people would say, if you look at the data, take an ibuprofen tablet," Moore said. "Acetaminophen is just not a very good analgesic [pain reliever], yet it’s the go-to drug because it’s thought to be safe."And that's where things get even more interesting: Acetaminophen isn't actually that safe."We always thought [acetaminophen] was safe, but there are increasing signals of accidental overdose in people who are regularly using it for chronic pain, and some liver toxicity," explained the University of Leeds's Philip Conaghan, who has studied adverse events data related to this popular drug.Between 1998 and 2003, acetaminophen was the leading cause of acute liver failure in the US. There are also hundreds of related deaths every year — though keep in mind that millions of people take drugs with acetaminophen, so these more extreme side effects are rare (especially if you're only taking them in small doses occasionally). Still, for the drug's minimal pain-killing benefits, the risks may not be worth it. "Don't believe that just because something is over-the-counter, it’s safe," Conaghan added. (He advised people to see their doctor if they're taking any of these painkillers for more than a few days — particularly if they're on other drugs already.)"[Tylenol] is an old drug, obsolete, and should be avoided altogether"Kay Brune, a professor of pharmacology and toxicology at Germany's Friedrich-Alexander University who has also studied the toxicity of painkillers, was even more direct in his thoughts on acetaminophen: "It's an old drug, obsolete, and should be avoided altogether."Aspirin is safer than acetaminophen, he said, though to be used as a pain reliever it requires much higher doses — which can have side effects like stomach upset. Aspirin also interferes with blood coagulation for days after taking it. "If you take one gram of aspirin," Brune explained, "you're at risk of bleeding for another four days." This is why aspirin has its place as a protective agent against strokes and heart attacks for people at a higher risk.Ibuprofen doesn't have these two problems — it's less toxic than the others in the doses that give people pain relief. But it has other side effects. "Ibuprofen puts people at risk of bleeds in the gastrointestinal tract and kidney damage — so it's not free of risk," said Brune. Using it in high doses also seems to raise blood pressure, and increase the risk of heart attack and stroke — one reason the Food and Drug Administration recently warned people should only use ibuprofen (and other "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs" or "NSAIDS" like naproxen) for short periods of time and in small amounts. I asked Brune about what he'd suggest for the occasional headache or sore muscle. "Taking 400 mg of ibuprofen won't cause measurable harm," he answered. "Of all drugs we have available, for most indications, it's also the most effective one." If the research community seems to have sided with ibuprofen for pain, is acetaminophen good for anything? Patients with kidney and cardiovascular problems may need to avoid NSAIDS like ibuprofen, so doctors could suggest Tylenol here even though it probably won't provide as much pain relief. There's also some evidence that NSAIDS may increase the risk of psychosis and cognitive impairment in the elderly, so doctors may avoid prescribing them for older patients. Fever is another area where acetaminophen can help, said Moore. According to one systematic review, acetaminophen seems to be safe for treating very young kids with fever, and you can give children as young as 3 months old acetaminophen, whereas you need to wait until kids are at least 6 months old to safely treat them with ibuprofen. (Aspirin is not recommended for anyone under 18 years old since it can cause a potentially fatal condition called Reye syndrome.) This may help to explain the popularity of drugs like Tylenol for kids.But a final caveat here: If your child is older than 6 months, it's not all that clear that acetaminophen outperforms ibuprofen for reducing fevers, and the same is true for adults. So keep that in mind when you're rethinking your medicine cabinet.Send your questions to Julia via the submission form or @juliaoftoronto on Twitter. Read more about Dear Julia here.
https://homes.yahoo.com/news/7-reasons-why-may-tired-110000235.html	7 reasons why you may be so tired	“If I’m so healthy, why am I tired all of the time?” asked my patient, a 47-year-old mother. I had examined her, reviewed her lab tests, and assured her that all was well. But her complaint is one I hear every day.Surveys of primary care medical practices in the U.S. show that patients mention moderate to severe fatigue in about a third of all office visits. A study reported in the Archives of Internal Medicine screened 1,000 patients with complaints of severe fatigue. About two-thirds of the cases were associated with identifiable diseases (anemia, diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, or rheumatoid arthritis); a third of them, however, had no definable cause.Take notes on tirednessIf you notice a similar problem, these questions might lead your doctor to an accurate diagnosis:1. Was the onset of fatigue sudden? If it was, the cause is usually physical. A gradual onset may have an emotional component.2. Do you feel better after a good night’s sleep? Sleep deprivation is rampant today. In a landmark 2006 report, the Institute of Medicine recommended 7 to 8 hours of sleep as optimal for adults. But in 2011, a survey in the journal Preventive Medicine found that more than one in three adults failed to get that amount (that number doubled for adolescents).Even if one gets sufficient sleep, the quality might not be top-notch. REM sleep, characterized by rapid eye movement, is the most beneficial type, and its absence can contribute to fatigue. A clue to non-REM sleep is the lack of dreaming, but to be certain, a sleep study is necessary. Apnea, in which the sleeper’s breathing stops and starts repeatedly, is a common disorder that disrupts sleep. (It’s often accompanied by severe snoring.)Take our sleep habits quiz and find out the best sleeping pills to treat insomnia.3. Are you confusing muscle weakness with fatigue? Sometimes the loss of strength (trouble lifting a suitcase, for example) can be mistaken for tiredness. Early symptoms of neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease or multiple sclerosis may seem like fatigue.4. Are you experiencing menstrual irregularities? Fatigue is common in early pregnancy, and the flushes and nocturnal sweating associated with menopause deprive many women of sleep.5. Do you have other symptoms? They can indicate a specific condition, for example, weight loss (cancer, an overactive thyroid), decreased libido (hormone-deficiency disease), changes in bowel habits (celiac disease, colitis), and shortness of breath (anemia, heart failure, lung problems).6. Do you have an infection that’s not apparent? Your doctor might suspect an underlying problem, such as toxoplasmosis if you touched cat litter, brucellosis if you’ve done farmwork, or a tick-borne illness such as Lyme disease if you spent time in the woods.7. Do you take drugs that might cause fatigue? Almost all of them can, but some prime of­fenders are beta-blockers (atenolol, metoprolol), diu­ret­­ics (furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide), pain­killers (ga­b­apentin, opioids), antihistamines (chlor­­­­phen­ira­mine, diphenhydramine), antidepressants (citalopram, sertraline), and anti-anxiety drugs (diaze­pam, lorazepam). If you’re utterly exhausted, your doctor might lower your dosage or change the medication altogether.As my patient pondered those questions, the cause of her fatigue became apparent. In addition to running a household and coping with two rebellious teenagers, she was hosting holiday parties and shopping for gifts. That stress was on top of holding down a part-time job as a paralegal. She had been making mistakes at work, and her relationships with her husband and children were in turmoil. After talking things over with her husband, she got household help and began seeing a therapist. A month later she was no longer tired and was actually able to enjoy the holiday season.Use our free app to explore your health insurance optionsNot sure where to begin with getting health insurance?

Theirs is a one-income household—like most families in India. Except, Arundhati, who works with the Life Insurance Corporation of India, is the family’s sole breadwinner, while the husband runs the house.Stay-at-home dads now account for more than 16% of at-home caretakers in the US, a number that has more than doubled over the past decade. But they are still very unusual in India, making them a subject of inquisitiveness, and sometimes disdain.Following is an edited excerpt from what Atul Agnihotri told Quartz about his life as a stay-at-home father:Share Tap image to zoom Aamir Khan (third from left) with the Agnihotri family.In August last year, the Satyamev Jayate team came over to our home, and shot a clip. A year passed, and we forgot all about it.Then, they called me two months ago, and they told me that my family’s lifestyle matched the theme they wanted to discuss on the talk show. Within a few days, we were at the Yash Raj Studios in Mumbai to shoot the episode on masculinity.As it turned out, the team could not find any stay-at-home fathers like me—at least no one who has been taking care of the household for over 15 years. I am at least sure there is none in my city, Pune.I finished my bachelor’s dgree in production engineering from Pune University in 1988. Soon after, I started work and continued for five years. In 1993, I was married to Arundhati, my wife, who hails from Ahmednagar, a small town 60 miles from Pune. The following year, we had our daughter, Mrunmayee.At the time, my father was bedridden. All of us lived in a small house, and being the eldest son, I started feeling very pressured. Nobody had forced me, but I knew I needed to arrange the money for his treatment, give my wife a better life by moving to a bigger house, and so forth.I was all of 23.My father’s health deteriorated. Matters went from bad to worse, and I started feeling helpless but found hope in alcohol. I started drinking sometimes. As my obligations increased over the next two years, I started drinking round-the-clock. I was out of control.One of the darkest periods of my life was the day my father died. It was in 1996, and I wasn’t in my senses to perform the last rites. Somebody held my hand, somebody else supported me to stand on my feet, so that I could light the pyre. That day should have never come. I have no memory of seeing him for the last time.My wife, though, was not easy to defeat. She—and she alone—took the step of taking her addicted husband to Muktangan, a residential rehabilitation center in Pune. I had troubled her deeply, but she stood by me.As the procedure is, I was admitted for 35 days to break the cycle of alcohol and overcome addiction. The recovery rate of alcoholism is very low. Out of 100, only five people manage to stay away from alcohol. The remaining 95% go back.My wife was familiar with the recovery program. She wanted to be careful that there was no chances of a relapse. So, she offered me a solution: I could look after the house, while she supported the family with her income.I readily accepted her offer and today, I haven’t touched alcohol in 17 years. This inspired me to become an active social worker at the rehabilitation center. In fact, it was through Muktangan, and a few media publications where I have been interviewed earlier, that Satyamev Jayate came across my name.At the time, my daughter was very young. I gave her all my time. I would cook for her; drop her to school, the playground, tuitions, everything. And I think the upbringing has had a very positive impact on her. Today, she wants to be a social worker, and I am very happy with her decision.Growing up, I had seen my mother toiling hard. I used to help her a lot—with cooking and cleaning—but I also knew her contribution to our family wasn’t ever acknowledged. Every day, she would make a rangoli at the doorstep of our small house. Nobody would ever see it or appreciate it. But her kindness, her selflessness, deeply impacted me.In India, we correlate how much we work with the income the person earns. So if I don’t bring a paycheck home, then I am not doing anything.People will say I am lazy, or that my wife dominates me.Yes, I am dependent on her for money. Till date, I haven’t been able to buy her a gift in the materialistic sense of the word, though our biggest gift to each other is our contented life together. She manages the finances of our home, and she saves for the family.But neither my wife nor my daughter pay any heed to what people say or think. We are not doing anything wrong. We have small expectations in life. We don’t want too much. And we get joy from little things in life.This article is a part of Quartz India. For more, follow this link.
http://news.yahoo.com/eight-indian-women-die-dozens-critical-mass-sterilisation-091950583.html	Ten Indian women die, dozens sick after mass sterilisation	Ten women have died in India and dozens more are in hospital, some in a critical condition, after a state-run programme that pays women to undergo sterilisation went badly wrong, officials said Tuesday.Sterilisation is one of the most popular methods of family planning in India, where the government provides cash and other incentives to try to control the country's billion-plus population, but rights groups say the system is often abused.More than 60 women fell ill after undergoing the surgery over the weekend in the central state of Chhattisgarh, and 10 have now died, local official Sonmani Borah told AFP."With two more deaths reported today (Tuesday), the death toll in the family planning operation-related case has gone up to 10,″ Borah told AFP by phone.Around 80 women had the procedure at the local government-run sterilisation camp.The women suffered vomiting and a dramatic fall in blood pressure, said Borah, the commissioner for Bilaspur district, where the camp was held.It was not immediately clear what caused the deaths, but doctors in the state told AFP the women's symptoms suggest the drugs they were given after the relatively simple procedure may have been the cause.View gallery The women were each paid 1,400 rupees ($23) to undergo laparoscopic sterilisation as part of a gover …State governments in India frequently organise mass sterilisation camps under a national programme whereby women are given 1,400 rupees ($23) as an incentive to have the operation.Under pressure to meet targets, some local governments also offer other incentives such as cars and electrical goods to couples volunteering for sterilisation.Although the surgery is voluntary, rights groups say the target-driven nature of the programme has led to women being coerced into being sterilised, often in inadequate medical facilities.Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh suspended four top health officials over the deaths, while a police complaint was lodged against the surgeon who performed the operations.Singh also announced compensation of 400,000 rupees ($6,500) for each of the families of those women who died.- Focus on women -View gallery Indian women are dying after state-backed sterilisation operations (AFP Photo/Strdel)Angry residents took to the streets of Bilaspur where many of the women have been hospitalised demanding action against those responsible.The women had undergone laparoscopic sterilisation, a process in which the fallopian tubes are blocked, usually under general anaesthesia.The Indian Express daily said the surgeries were carried out by one doctor and his assistant in around five hours."There was no negligence. He is a senior doctor. We will probe (the incident)," the chief medical officer of Bilaspur R.K. Bhange told the newspaper.Last year, authorities in eastern India came under fire after a news channel unearthed footage showing scores of women dumped unconscious in a field following a mass sterilisation.The women had all undergone the procedure at a hospital that local officials said was not equipped to accommodate such a large number of patients.In 2011, the government issued guidelines outlining the standard operating procedures for sterilisation services in camps.But a 2012 report by Human Rights Watch urged the government to set up an independent grievance redress system to allow people to report coercion and poor quality services at sterilisation centres.It also said the government should prioritise training for male government workers to provide men with information and counselling about contraceptive choices.But despite the recommendations to the national government, problems persist on the ground.India's family planning programme has traditionally focused on women, and experts say that male sterilisation is still not accepted socially.Government figures from 2008 show that around one third of the 54 percent of the population that reported using any form of family planning opted for female sterilisation.
http://www.jewishworldreview.com/0815/hanson082015.php3	Victor Davis Hanson - Big government as the new Terminator	Social observers from Aristotle and Juvenal to James Madison and George Orwell have all warned of the dangers of out-of-control government. Lately, we have seen plenty of proof that they were frighteningly correct.The Environmental Protection Agency spilled 3 million gallons of toxic sludge into a tributary of the Animas River in Colorado. The stinky yellow flume of old mine waste -- rife with cancer-causing mercury and arsenic -- threatens to pollute the drinking and recreational water of three states.Had a private oil company acted so incompetently and negligently, it would have been fined billions of dollars by the same EPA. The company's top executives might have been subject to criminal prosecutions. The business's reputation would have been tarnished for years. Just ask BP officials what the Obama administration did to the corporation after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico.But who will police the green police at the EPA?When EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy promises that the agency will take "full responsibility," what does that tired banality mean? Will she resign? Will bureaucrats responsible for the toxic spill face fines and jail sentences? Will residents be able to sue McCarthy and her subordinates for diminishing their quality of life? Will the Sierra Club and the Environmental Defense Fund rush to federal court to file briefs?Consider the vast bureaucracy of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Is it culpable for knowingly not enforcing immigration law and thus allowing some undocumented immigrants to commit violent crimes?In cases where innocent Americans are killed by undocumented immigrants with long histories of felonies and deportations -- such as the recent killing of Kate Steinle in San Francisco -- can the victims' families sue ICE or sanctuary cities for either releasing or hosting criminals who were residing in the U.S. illegally?In our litigious society in which plaintiffs sue fast-food franchises for serving excessively hot coffee, why do government bureaucrats escape culpability when the innocent die or are injured as a result of bureaucratic negligence?When the IRS hounds citizens about their taxes, can Americans inform the agency that they are invoking the Fifth Amendment and refusing to answer out of fear of self-incrimination -- and expect to face no criminal consequences?No? Why, then, was high-ranking IRS official Lois Lerner able to sign off on the excessive scrutiny of some conservative nonprofit groups, lie about it and then invoke the Fifth -- without any legal consequences?Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton likely broke a number of federal laws while secretary of state in using a private email server at her home to conduct both private and public business. One, she kept documents containing classified information at an unauthorized location. Two, she either destroyed or removed official communications entrusted to her as a public servant. Three, she was legally responsible for the loss of information involving national defense. Four, she likely destroyed documents to block federal agencies' examination of them.So far, Clinton had escaped any consequences.What is the common denominator in these government scandals -- as well as the recent scandals involving the needless deaths of veterans waiting for care at Veterans Health Administration facilities, the sex and booze escapades of Secret Service agents, the Las Vegas junketing at the General Services Administration, the snooping at the National Security Agency and the lack of cyber-security at Office of Personnel Management?The bigger that government gets, the more employees who are hired, and the more unaccountable power that accrues to bureaucracies, the more government takes on a life of its own. Public grandees resemble Hollywood's out-of-control androids or Frankenstein monsters that turn on their creators -- in these cases, us, the taxpayers.Secure, high-level government administrative jobs -- where dismissal is rare and automatic promotion common -- promote mediocrity. Institutionalized incompetence explains why NASA can no longer launch its own astronauts into space without help from Russia, or why the cost of the California high-speed rail project soars before an inch of track is laid.Clearly, Clinton and Lerner apparently assumed that as federal officials, they were not subject to the same laws imposed on other Americans. They reckoned that others in the fraternity of big government would protect them from legal jeopardy. And they are probably right.Under the Obama administration, there is also a more disturbing trend: the equation of big government with social justice and hostility to private enterprise. If the EPA and other federal agencies are felt to be on the "right side" of fairness and equality, then why object when their means to supposedly noble ends violate or neglect the law?Big government has become the new Terminator, at war with those who created it, who fund it -- and who must obey it.Comment by clicking here.Victor Davis Hanson, a classicist and military historian, is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and a recipient of the 2007 National Humanities Medal.
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/11/17/obama-calls-is-beheadings-pure-evil/20994556/	Obama calls IS beheadings 'pure evil'	BEIRUT (AP) -- The Islamic State group has beheaded Peter Kassig, releasing a video Sunday showing a masked militant standing over the severed head of a man it said was the former U.S. Army Ranger-turned-aid worker, who was seized while delivering relief supplies in Syria last year.President Barack Obama confirmed Kassig's slaying after a U.S. review of the video, which also showed the mass beheadings of a dozen Syrian soldiers.The 26-year-old Kassig, who founded an aid group to help Syrians caught in their country's brutal civil war, "was taken from us in an act of pure evil by a terrorist group that the world rightly associates with inhumanity," Obama said in a statement.He denounced the extremist group, which he said "revels in the slaughter of innocents, including Muslims, and is bent only on sowing death and destruction."The slain hostage's parents, Ed and Paula Kassig, said they were "heartbroken" by their son's killing, but "incredibly proud" of his humanitarian work.Kassig "lost his life as a result of his love for the Syrian people and his desire to ease their suffering," the parents said in a statement from Indianapolis, where a vigil was held Sunday for the slain American. His parents attended the vigil.With Kassig's death, the Islamic State group has killed five Westerners it was holding. American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff were beheaded, as were British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning.Unlike previous videos of slain Western hostages, the footage released Sunday did not show the decapitation of Kassig or the moments leading up to his death."This is Peter Edward Kassig, a U.S. citizen ... who fought against the Muslims in Iraq," said the black-clad militant, who spoke with a British accent that was distorted in the video, apparently to disguise his identity. Previous videos featured a militant with a British accent that the FBI says it has identified, though it hasn't named him publicly.The footage released Sunday identifies the militants' location as Dabiq, a town in northern Syria that the Islamic State group uses as the title of its English-language propaganda magazine and where they believe an apocalyptic battle between Muslims and their enemies will occur.The high-definition video also showed the beheadings of about a dozen men identified as Syrian military officers and pilots, all dressed in blue jumpsuits. The black-clad militant warns that U.S. soldiers will meet a similar fate."We say to you, Obama: You claim to have withdrawn from Iraq four years ago," the militant said. "Here you are: You have not withdrawn. Rather, you hid some of your forces behind your proxies." A U.S.-led coalition is targeting the Islamic State group in airstrikes, supporting Western-backed Syrian rebels, Kurdish fighters and the Iraqi military.Kassig, who served in the U.S. Army's 75th Ranger Regiment, a special operations unit, deployed to Iraq in 2007. After being medically discharged, he returned to the Middle East in 2012 and formed a relief group, Special Emergency Response and Assistance, to aid Syrian refugees.A certified EMT, Kassig had delivered food and medical supplies and provided trauma care to wounded Syrians before being captured in eastern Syria on Oct. 1, 2013. Friends say he converted to Islam in captivity and took the first name Abdul-Rahman.In a statement issued as he flew back to Washington from the Asia-Pacific region, Obama said Kassig "was a humanitarian who worked to save the lives of Syrians injured and dispossessed" by war. The president offered prayers and condolences to Kassig's family."We cannot begin to imagine their anguish at this painful time," he said.Burhan Agha, a Syrian who worked with Kassig in Lebanon, wept when recounting his friend's humanitarian work."If I could apologize to each American, one by one, I would, because Peter died in Syria, while he was helping the Syrian people," Agha told The Associated Press by telephone from Switzerland, where he is seeking asylum. "Those who killed him claimed to have done it in the name of Islam. I am a Muslim and am from Syria. ... (His killers) are not Muslims."British Prime Minister David Cameron said he was "horrified by the cold-blooded murder," saying that the Islamic State group had "again shown their depravity."In previous videos showing the beheadings of the two American journalists and two British aid workers, the hostages were shown kneeling in orange jumpsuits as they were forced to make speeches before their killer lifted a knife to their throats.The latest video did not show Kassig being beheaded. And unlike previous videos, it did not show other Western captives or directly threaten to behead anyone else. It also had lingering close-ups on some militants' exposed faces, a few of whom appeared to be foreigners.The video appeared on websites used in the past by the Islamic State group, which now controls a third of Syria and Iraq.The terror group still holds other captives, including British photojournalist John Cantlie, who has appeared in several videos delivering statements for the IS, likely under duress, and a 26-year-old American woman captured last year in Syria while working for aid groups. U.S. officials have asked that the woman not be identified out of fears for her safety.The video appeared to be part of continuous efforts to strike at the U.S., which is leading an aerial campaign against the group that began in August in Iraq and spread to Syria the following month.The video came two days after a recording by the group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was uploaded to the Internet. The militant leader warned that the U.S.-led coalition's campaign had failed and it would eventually have to send ground troops into battle.The group has declared a self-styled Islamic caliphate in areas under its control, which it governs according to its violent interpretation of Shariah law, including massacring rebellious tribes and selling women and children of religious minorities into slavery.The group's militants have also beheaded and shot dead hundreds of captives, mostly Syrian and Iraqi soldiers, during its sweep across the two countries, and has celebrated its mass killings in extremely graphic videos.The Islamic State group has its roots in al-Qaida's Iraqi affiliate but was expelled from the global terror network over its brutal tactics and refusal to obey orders to confine its activities to Iraq. It became even more extreme amid the bloody civil war in neighboring Syria and grew strong enough to launch a lightning offensive across Iraq.Syria's war began as an uprising against President Bashar Assad. Activists say that conflict has killed more than 200,000 people.More from AOL.com: Friends mourn apparent beheading of US aid worker Iraq's forces drive IS militants from key town US military chief says battle with ISIS starting to turn Obama: Troop deployments depend on circumstances

"My parents loved us, they fed us whatever we wanted." She shared an anecdote about her crush telling her, "You'd be like real hot if you were 10 pounds lighter." Trainor says her reaction was to cry and "not eat for the rest of the day."Then, Trainor said the following:"I wasn't strong enough to have an eating disorder. I tried to go anorexic for a good three hours. I ate ice and celery, but that’s not even anorexic. And I quit. I was like, 'Ma, can you make me a sandwich? Like, immediately.'"Lovato, who has been very vocal about her struggles with eating disorders, was not happy with the implication that it takes "strength" to have an one. She responded in a series of tweets: Having an eating disorder doesn't show "strength." Strength is when are able to overcome your demons after being sick and tired for so long. — Demi Lovato (@ddlovato) November 12, 2014   There's a wide misconception that anorexia and/or bulimia is a choice and you often hear people say things like "why doesn't she just start — Demi Lovato (@ddlovato) November 12, 2014   eating?"

He had been scheduled to call the Vikings-Buffalo Bills game in Week 7, but that assignment now will go to veteran Tim Brando. Brendan Ayanbadejo, who, to be fair, was far from perfect in his call last week, as well, will remain on that call with Brando.Goldberg is most famous for being a UFC announcer, and he also previously has called the NHL's Minnesota Wild games, some college football and — most notably, of course — the Lingerie Football League's championship game.But his NFL days very well might be in the one-and-done category. You'd have to think that Fox executives were more upset at his social-media rantings than his struggles in the booth, although neither helped his cause. You can't say that Golden Tate is a Vikings receiver and that Norv Turner coaches for the Lions; that doesn't fly on this level.Let this be the launching pad for the "Free Gus Johnson" folks out there. Start the campaign now. Johnson might be the lead college football announcer for Fox, but you just know there is a strong contingent of his supporters who would love to see him return to calling NFL games in his own inimitable and epic style.- - - - - - -Eric Edholm is a writer for Shutdown Corner on Yahoo Sports.

http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2014/09/16/slash-conspirators-world-on-fire-album-premiere/15692315/	Album premiere: Slash's 'World On Fire'	Two albums in, the members of Slash's band have settled into their groove."We had a certain kind of chemistry, right from the get-go," say Slash, whose World On Fire album featuring Myles Kennedy and The Conspirators, out today, is streaming at USA TODAY. "From all the touring and the constant playing and writing together, everybody has hit their comfort zone as a unit."The follow-up to 2012's Apocalyptic Love, World On Fire features the guitarist, Alter Bridge vocalist Kennedy and a rhythm section consisting of drummer Brent Fitz and bassist Todd Kerns. The title track, No. 6 on USA TODAY's active rock airplay chart, sets the tone for the album."There's a heaviness to the record that is similar to World On Fire," Slash says. "It's a very diverse record. It's all rock 'n' roll, but it covers different feels and rhythms. Across the board, though, it has a certain aggressive quality."Fans of the classic Slash guitar sound from his days with Guns N' Roses and Velvet Revolver will hear that quality in the riffs that form the foundation of songs such as Wicked Stone, Too Far Gone and The Dissident."I'm a riff guy," Slash says. "Even as a kid, way before I started playing guitar, I always gravitated toward songs that had a cool guitar or piano riff, some sort of instrumental melody. I remember it especially with Stevie Wonder, where his songs had a certain kind of groove, a single-note pattern that set up the bed for the rest of the song."Slash often started the album's songs with a riff, perhaps adding the musical basis for verses and a bridge or a chorus, before bringing them to the rest of the band for input and lyrics from Kennedy.World On Fire includes one instrumental, Safari Inn, that grew out of a riff that never got lyrics. "I just started playing guitar solos over it; it seemed to be the nature of that piece," Slash says. "It was open to Myles' interpretation. He never really came up with anything for it, so I just shortened it and turned it into an instrumental."Slash and The Conspirators played the single World On Fire this summer on the Let Rock Rule world tour with Aerosmith. During headlining shows between those dates, they'd usually add Stone Blind and 30 Years to Life."I knew 30 Years to Life would end up being a single at some point," Slash says. "It's an easy song to play, but it's a fun song. It seemed like something we could get together, because we didn't have a lot of time to rehearse."Stone Blind, again, was a simple song with a good groove that the crowd would probably get without having ever heard the record."Now that the album's out, they'll start adding more songs, especially on the European tour that begins in November."By the end of next summer, we'll have played every song on the record once or twice," Slash says. "You just keep snapping them off and sticking them in the set."Slash also has written the theme music for Universal Studio Hollywood's annual Halloween Horror Nights maze, which is set in a dilapidated roadside attraction called Sweet Licks Frozen Clown Pops Family Amusement Center that is run by a family of psychotic clowns."Clown music has a certain rhythm to it, a ¾-timing, and a certain sway that you recognize," Slash says. "I took that and came up with a cool melodic riff that fit that and some other little melodies to go with it. It's a theme that runs through the whole thing, but it has different dynamics as you go through different sections of the maze. I'm very proud of it."&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;!--iframe--&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1tZvCD5

Printed with a mysterious name "Tjipetir." What are these and where are they coming from?To find out, let's take a journey 100 years into the past and go halfway around the world to Java, Indonesia, in the early 1900s. We land at the gutta-percha plantation called Tjipetir.Before plastic was commonly used, this substance was used to make teddy bear noses, golf balls, firemen's hoses and much more. The plaques floating around are blocks of this substance.According to the BBC, for a time there was some excitement that the plaques were from the Titanic, as they were listed on the ship's manifest. But, now it seems more likely they're coming from a sunken Japanese ship off the coast of Sicily, the Miyazaki Maru, sunk by a German U-boat in WWI.Recent salvage work on the ship may have released the rubber-like plates into the sea, and now they're washing up on shores near and far.

http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/eye-on-college-football/24793064	Jameis Winston: 'I'm hurting this team'	Jameis Winston has thrown 11 interceptions so far this season. (USATSI)Florida State is 9-0 and ranked No. 2 in both major polls. When the College Football Playoff rankings come out Tuesday, the Seminoles will be ranked No. 2 at worst. The last time the Noles lost a game was nearly two full years ago on Nov. 24, 2012.So on the football field, things are going pretty well, but apparently Jameis Winston thinks things can be going even better, and he places the blame for that on himself."I'm hurting this team, I really am," Winston said after Saturday's 34-20 win over Virginia.Winston is referring to a recent spate of turnovers. On the season, the reigning Heisman Trophy winner has thrown 11 interceptions after throwing 10 during the entire 2013 campaign. Five of Winston's last six interceptions have led to touchdowns for Florida State opponents and have put the Seminoles in early holes like the 21-0 deficit it faced against Louisville that they had to battle back from."It's not the offense starting slow now," Winston said. "It's just me starting slow, throwing interceptions, and that has to change."I've got to stop turning the ball over, and we've got to start making some noise in the first half. ... My job as the leader of the team and as the quarterback of this team, I have to put both sides of the ball in good position to win the game."Thus far Florida State has been able to overcome the turnovers, but turning the ball over as often as Winston has is playing with fire. Sooner or later, you're going to get burned. With an ACC title in the balance as well as a berth in the CFP, the first turnover that burns Florida State could prove to be extremely costly.
https://www.yahoo.com/tech/s/sprint-just-made-huge-move-steal-away-t-163524438.html	Sprint just made a huge move to steal you away from AT&T and Verizon	Sprint is showing signs of life at just the right timeAlthough Sprint has been the wireless world’s whipping boy for years, the carrier has been showing some signs of competitiveness in recent months and this week it’s announcing its boldest move yet. Per Re/code, Sprint this week will start offering a new pricing scheme “that it claims will halve the bills of customers who defect from AT&T and Verizon in the latest salvo of an increasingly bitter price war.”RELATED: Consumer Reports says Sprint is still America’s worst wireless carrier and it’s not even closeStarting this Friday, Verizon and AT&T customers can bring in a copy of their monthly bills to Sprint stores and representatives will come up with a plan that will see them paying half of what they’re now paying for voice, SMS and data. This is particularly cool because if you’re the type of person who regularly gets hit with overage charges on AT&T or Verizon, it won’t count against you when Sprint tallies up how much your new plan should cost.As with all such deals, there are some catches here. First, Re/code writes that anyone who wants to take advantage of this deal will “have to buy an unsubsidized device either upfront or through installments or use one of Sprint’s new leasing plans.” The other big catch is that you’ll have to use Sprint’s mobile data network, which has consistently been ranked the slowest among all major carriers.That said, Sprint really is doing its best to make this offer tempting, as it will also pay off $350 worth of your early termination fees if you switch.

http://www.salon.com/2014/12/23/sean_hannity_named_worst_of_fox_by_colleagues_has_twitter_temper_tantrum/	Sean Hannity has epic Twitter meltdown after his colleagues name him ‘Worst of Fox’	In the spirit of the season (the spirit is harsh, blanket judgement), the website Mediaite conducted a survey of cable news hosts from CNN, Fox News and MSNBC which asked respondents to rank their colleagues from best to worst. Unsurprisingly (or, perhaps, surprisingly since Bill O’Reilly was nominated in the same category), Sean Hannity was voted Worst Host on Fox News.Hannity was really sad and mad about it and had to stomp around Twitter to cool off.
https://www.yahoo.com/tech/s/one-more-iphone-6-problem-aware-175412811.html	Here’s one more iPhone 6 problem you should be aware of	How Apple plans to make sure future iOS releases aren’t disasters like iOS 8.0.1The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are selling like hot cakes in stores, but that doesn’t mean Apple’s hot new iPhones are flawless. In fact, many different issues have affected iPhone 6 buyers, including bending problems, memory issues, screen scratch issues, rear-facing camera problems, with a front-facing camera issue being the last one to have been discovered.FROM EARLIER: The iPhone 6 might be low-res, but Apple’s highest-resolution device ever is coming soonAccording to Business Insider, which is mentioning threads on the matter on Reddit, MacRumors and iFixit, some iPhone 6 owners have noticed that the front-facing camera of their device is prone to slight movement, causing it to be misaligned. The good news, though, is that this flaw doesn’t seem to be affecting its performance.The camera shifts slightly to the left, showing a grey crescent shape on the right side of it. Apple does not know what it causing the problem, but the company does replace affected iPhones on the spot, a Reddit user said.“Apple Store employee here, we don’t know why they shift and if you choose we can replace the display which will replace the front facing camera or just swap the device all together,” Reddit user spykeman1528 wrote. “I usually just offer the full unit swap since customers feel the entire device is defective at that point. I only recommend display repairs if a customers data is not backed up and that poses less of a risk for data loss than obvious full data loss of a whole unit swap if the customer is not backs up.”It’s not clear how widespread this “Crescentgate” issue is at this point.

A one-year-old elephant under attack by a pride of vicious lions refused to give in, Inside Edition reports.After straying from its herd, the baby elephant found itself surrounded by 14 hungry lionesses and their cubs. New York Post's video shows the creatures climbing on the elephant's back and digging into its hide with their teeth and claws to force him down.The attack was captured on video by tourists on safari in Zambia. The tourists can be heard rooting for the elephant.At one point, three lions climb on the elephant's back, but he never gave up, swinging his body around as he tried to shake off the predators.Next, he made a smart move and charged into the water. Lions avoid water if they can, so they were quick to abort their mission. Then, the elephant actually turned on the lions and they fled in fear.The video ends as the back and forth continues, but the baby elephant is said to have survived and made his way back to his herd.The tourists who shot the video gave the little elephant a nickname: Hercules.Check out the full video here:

http://www.voanews.com/content/treasury-chief-us-will-run-out-of-money-in-february/1831700.html	Treasury Chief: US Will Run Out of Money in February	The U.S. government says it will run out of money to pay its bills in late February, a bit sooner than first thought.In December, Treasury chief Jacob Lew wrote to congressional leaders that the borrowing limit would be reached in late February or early March. But on Thursday, he urged Congress to raise the country's borrowing limit again by the end of February, to make sure the country does not default on its debts.The U.S. has accumulated $17.3 trillion in debt over the years and the figure grows by the day. The government suspended limits on the debt ceiling in October, but is reinstating it on February 7. At that point, Treasury officials can use what they call "extraordinary measures" to keep paying the country's bills even as it edges closer to running out of cash.In recent years, raising the country's borrowing limit has led to contentious political debates in Washington. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, is seeking an increase in the ceiling without conditions, saying that new borrowing authority is needed to pay debts that have already been incurred by the country. His Republican opponents in Congress want more spending cuts before approving another increase in the borrowing limit.The leader of the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, Speaker John Boehner, said he does not know how any negotiations over the debt limit will play out, but that under no circumstances should the U.S. default."All I know is that we should not default on our debt. We shouldn't even get close to it," he said.U.S. spending and debt issues have proved contentious during Obama's five years in the White House, but Congress is on the verge of approving a compromise $1.1 trillion government spending plan for 2014 that he supports.
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/11/21/snow-ending-but-rain-possible-for-buffalo/20997111/	Snow ends, but roof collapses and flooding are major concerns	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- A snowfall that brought huge drifts and closed roads in the Buffalo area finally ended Friday as the looming threat of rain and higher temperatures through the weekend and beyond raised the possibility of floods and more roofs collapsing under the heavy loads.More than 30 major roof collapses, most involving farm and flat-roof buildings, were reported overnight, officials said Friday, after snow Thursday brought the Buffalo area's three-day total to an epic 7 feet or more. Little or no snow was expected on Friday, and the forecast called for a chance of rain on Saturday and more through Monday, along with temperatures of about 60 degrees.As towns and villages began preparing for potential flooding, homeowners and store employees around the region climbed onto roofs to shovel off the snow and reduce the danger of collapse."Five hours yesterday and that's just the beginning," John Normile said Friday of the effort to clear snow from the roof of his Lake View ranch-style home. He, along with his daughter and her boyfriend, had knocked about 6 feet off the back of the house and planned to be back at it for a second day."We're getting really concerned about the weight of it," Normile said. "We've got to do it before the rain comes."The storms were blamed for at least 13 deaths in western New York, mostly from heart attacks and exposure. The latest was a 50-year-old man was found Friday morning in his car, which was buried in snow in Cheektowaga, police said. The cause of death wasn't immediately known.Two elderly residents of a nursing home died after it was evacuated amid concerns of a roof collapse, Deputy Erie County Executive Richard Tobe said."We know that relocating people from nursing homes is a very tough thing to do," Tobe said.More than 50 people were evacuated from several mobile home parks in suburban Cheektowaga and West Seneca on Thursday because roofs were buckling. Tobe said at least 90 small roof collapses involving carports and other structures had been reported by Friday morning, in addition to damage to a pharmacy and a metal warehouse operated by a Christmas decorations company, where damage was estimated in the millions.Some farm animals had been injured in damaged barns, he said.With roads impassable, driving bans in effect and the Buffalo Bills' stadium buried in snow, the NFL decided to move the Bills' Sunday home game against the New York Jets to Monday night in Detroit.National Guardsmen drove nurses to their hospital shifts. State troopers helped elderly residents trapped in their homes. State officials assembled 463 plows, 129 loaders and 40 dump trucks from across the state for a massive cleanup effort.Some Buffalo-area schools were closed for the fourth day, burning through snow days with winter still a month away.Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Friday that a 132-mile stretch of the Thruway, closed since Tuesday, will reopen at 3 p.m., with some restrictions.Exit ramps will remain closed along the westernmost 75 miles, so, "Assume if you get on headed west you can't get off until Pennsylvania," Cuomo said, noting that roads remain "very dangerous."With deliveries interrupted, some grocery stores reported running low on staples like bread and milk."No matter how you cut it, this event will end up in the top five for the Lake Erie area," said National Weather Service Director Louis Uccellini.Cities and towns were positioning pumps and other equipment in anticipation of widespread flooding. The worst is expected Monday when, with temperatures at or above 60, snow is expected to melt faster than it can be absorbed by the ground or snowpack."There's roughly the equivalent of six inches of rain in the snowpack that will essentially be released over two days," Tobe said. "If it was released as rain it would be a monumental storm."But flooding will likely affect mostly basements and creeks, he said. "It's not going to be this giant flooding like you see in hurricanes," he said.Even for the Buffalo area - one of the snowiest and hardiest places in America - this was one for the history books. The three-day total is close to the nearly 8 feet that the region typically gets over an entire year.Because the Buffalo area is so snowy, building codes require homes and businesses to be able to handle up to 50 pounds per square foot on their roofs, which would be about as heavy as a slab of concrete 4 inches thick, according to Mark Bajorek, a structural engineer.As anyone who has ever shoveled snow knows, its weight depends in part on how wet or fluffy it is, not just on how deep it is. But Bajorek said some buildings may be close to that limit now, with more precipitation on the way.Engineers were expected to be out Friday trying to determine how much water was in the snowpack.---Associated Press writers Michael Hill and Mary Esch contributed from Albany.More news: Blue pear-shaped diamond sets auction record 5 family members killed on 'dream trip' to Disney Police question Indian guru after standoff arrest

Fans have even called her "Cinderella" because she gets passed over by her family. But the "wait" might be worth it — if her dad can get what he wants.According to Radar Online, patriarch Jim Bob Duggar wants to set up his oldest daughter, Jana, with former NFL star and current sports broadcaster Tim Tebow. The family is friendly with Tebow's mom, Pam. They posted a photo together in November, at a benefit for a crisis pregnancy center, and fans posted comments like, "So, I'm thinking you should introduce Jana to Tim."It would make sense if Jim Bob is lobbying for Tebow as a son-in-law. Tim and Jana would be a cute couple. Both are devout Christians, and Tebow, 27, has famously said he wants to save sex for marriage. He'd fit right in with the ultra-conservative Duggar family, and also understands what it's like to be famous and religious at the same time. Tebow has had a few girlfriends in the past, and briefly dated Camilla Belle.Plus, Jana has had a pretty rough go of it lately. 19 Kids and Counting fans couldn't help but get mad seeing her being forced to play seamstress for her two younger sisters' weddings. She was shown hemming bridesmaid and flower girl dresses while the rest of the family sat down for tea.Nothing has been confirmed yet, but still: For Jana, marrying someone as famous as Tim Tebow would be a pretty great way to have the last laugh.Follow Megan on Twitter.
http://www.voanews.com/content/reu-polls-close-in-tunisian-election/2568782.html	Political Veteran Essebsi Elected Tunisia's New President	Veteran politician and staunch anti-Islamist Beji Caid Essebsi has been elected Tunisia's next president.Official results give 88-year-old Beji Caid Essebsi nearly 56 percent of the vote in Sunday's runoff election - compared to 44 percent for incumbent interim President Moncef Marzouki. Secularist Essebsi was expected to win the vote - and declared early victory as polls closed on Sunday.In remarks broadcast by French TV, Essebsi said his election marked the start of Tunisia's future. He said he wanted the nation to move forward united. He also saluted those who voted for his opponent.The vote closes Tunisia's somewhat rocky transition to democracy, nearly three years after a January revolution ousted long-term dictator Zine el Abidine Ben Ali. The revolt triggered the wider Arab uprisings, that have been marked by chaos, bloodshed and setbacks in many countries.   But Tunisia has moved ahead. This year, it completed a new constitution. It held legislative elections in October that saw Essebsi's secular Nidaa Tounes party emerge with the most votes. It beat the moderate Islamist Ennahda that has been in power for much of this post-revolution transition.In voting for Essebsi, analyst Anthony Dworkin, of the European Council on Foreign Relations says Tunisians cast a vote for stability."I think they went for a figure - after three years of chaos and turmoil in the country, little economic progress, some security problems - I think the attraction for Essebsi and his party is he was someone who could get the ship ... back on course. And that he was a tried and tested hand, and someone who would be able to move things forward," he said.Essebsi served under both former President Ben-Ali and Tunisia's first post-independence president, Habib Bourguiba. As president, he is responsible for security, defense and foreign affairs. But his party will also command parliament, although it must first seek political alliances to do so.Looking ahead, analyst Dwokin believed Tunisia needed major reforms of key institutions to consolidate its revolution."It's not clear the people around Essebsi and Essebsi himself have that kind of vision. Certainly what we've hear is much more to do with consolidating the state - which perhaps is necessary, but it needs to be consolidated and reformed. And that's the challenge," said Dwokin.Tunisia also has to heal its division. The presidential campaign was marked by mudslinging on both sides. And the vote was split in ideology - pro- versus anti-Islamists - and geographically. The northern, coastal areas tended to vote for Essebsi, while the south went for Marzouki.The future of Ennahda, the country's second biggest political party, will also be key in moving forward. It is unlikely Nidaa Tounes will pick Ennahda as a coalition partner. What was essential, analyst Dworkin said, was that the Islamist party retained a legitimate role in the opposition.
http://www.foodandwine.com/blogs/2015/1/1/the-problem-with-stoned-diners-in-denver	The Problem with Stoned Diners in Denver	Photo © vasa / AlamyThe city’s restaurateurs face a new problem: the random customer who is way too stoned.A few months ago I got into a cab in Denver, and my driver asked where I was from. When I told him New York City, he asked if I wanted to go to a marijuana dispensary. Apparently, I was the first out-of-towner he’d met in a while who wasn’t looking for a good place to buy pot brownies and THC-laced gummy bears.I’d come to Denver to check out the restaurant scene—where the effects of marijuana legalization are having an unexpected side effect. It’s not that chefs are ruining their short ribs by adding too much vanilla kush (that would be illegal unless the restaurant was licensed) or creating menus specifically for the munchies (though surely an enterprising place will do that soon). It’s that some guests pass out in the middle of dinner because they ingested too much THC beforehand. Chef Jennifer Jasinski, who just opened the seafood spot Stoic & Genuine in Union Station, has seen it happen at her flagship restaurant, Rioja. “Out of nowhere, someone’s head will go down on the table,” she says.So what does Jasinski do? Kick customers out? Nudge them until they lift their heads out of their plates? It turns out she and her staff do what common sense tells them to: Give the person lots of liquids and try to make everyone else at the table feel less embarrassed; worst-case scenario, call an ambulance. “One time,” says Jasinski, “we asked if there was a doctor in the house. And there was.”Related: Denver Restaurants Boulder, Colorado's Pearl Street

The company's experience handling the multitude of existing payments industry standards will also be valuable.SAN FRANCISCO — MasterCard is joining the FIDO Alliance, signaling that the payment network is getting interested in using fingerprints and other biometric data to identify people for online payments.MasterCard will be the first major payment network to join FIDO. The Alliance is developing an open industry standard for biometric data such as fingerprints to be used for identification online. The goal is to replace clunky passwords and take friction out of logging on and purchasing using mobile devices.Apple's new iPhone 5s smartphone has a fingerprint sensor, but the tech giant is not part of FIDO. However, Google is part of the Alliance, and devices running Google's Android operating system will have fingerprint sensors by next year.The addition of MasterCard will help FIDO expand its standard to more types of transactions. The company's experience handling the multitude of existing payments-industry standards will also be valuable."Our involvement with the FIDO Alliance, as well as other activities across the industry, will help deliver strong security for consumers, merchants and issuers, as well as a great consumer experience," said Ed McLaughlin, chief emerging payments officer at MasterCard.Joining FIDO will give MasterCard different ways of identifying people and help it decide when to use those techniques, depending on the situation.FIDO is trying to standardize lots of different ways of identifying people online, not just through biometric methods.Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1fJzVQ0

Greene challenged the commission's request for documents.The commission on Wednesday rejected her objection to a subpoena, the Alaska Dispatch News (http://ow.ly/EZQhr) reported. That gives the agency the authority to continue the investigation to determine whether money that was spent would trigger reporting requirements.Greene, whose legal name is Charlene Egbe, said the order should be worrisome to those who take a stand on any issue. "If you publish your personal stance on any issue, then this government agency believes they have the authority to ask for emails, bank-account information, all of your records," she said. "That's scary."The commission is unfairly targeting her, she added.During a live newscast in September, she revealed herself to be the owner of a medical marijuana business and quit her job with a four-letter tirade. Soon after quitting, she launched an IndieGoGo online fundraising campaign to continue her fight for marijuana legalization. The effort raised more than $8,400.The commission notes that she hasn't been found in violation of the law. "But without a reasonable investigation, no determination can be reached," the commission wrote in a three-page order.Greene said the campaign should not be subject to reporting requirements because it was fundraising for her organization, the Alaska Cannabis Club, not for passing Ballot Measure 2. The agency cited examples where they believed her campaign was advocating for the initiative.Alaska and Oregon this month joined Washington and Colorado as states approving legal pot.___Information from: Alaska Dispatch News, http://www.adn.com
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/11/13/vatican-rep-2015-ideal-time-for-pope-ny-visit/20993504/	Vatican rep: 2015 'ideal time' for pope NY visit	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Vatican's envoy to the United Nations strongly hinted that Pope Francis would visit New York next year to address world leaders at the General Assembly, saying Thursday that the coming 70th anniversary of the world body would be "the ideal time."Archbishop Bernardito Auza, the permanent observer of the Holy See, also told The Associated Press that "if he comes to Philadelphia, he will come to New York."Pope Francis in August confirmed that he wants to visit the United States in 2015 and that he'd like to go to Philadelphia for a family rally. The pope added that he's also been invited by President Barack Obama and Congress and by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.Auza spoke Thursday about a coming exhibition of centuries-old manuscripts related to St. Francis of Assisi that will be on display later this month at the United Nations and then in Brooklyn. Pope Francis, a Jesuit from Argentina, was the first to name himself after the 13th-century friar who gave up his wealth to minister to the poor."Everybody hopes that this exhibition of St. Francis would be a kind of an announcement" of a papal visit, Auza said.Then he dropped another hint, comparing the rare exhibition to the Vatican's loaning of the Michelangelo masterpiece "Pieta" for a popular World's Fair exhibit in New York in 1964 - which was followed months later by the first visit by a reigning pope to the U.S.Pope Paul VI addressed the U.N. on that historic visit."We hope this same sense of celebration will take place this time," Auza said of the new exhibition. He added it's likely that only the pope himself will make an official announcement of his travel plans.The fragile manuscripts from the 13th and 14th centuries feature the first writings related to St. Francis, including the famous Canticle of the Creatures, a poetic celebration of nature and "our sister Mother Earth, who feeds us and rules us."The work is seen as the beginning of Italian literature.The manuscripts, on display in the United States for the first time, are set to arrive Friday and will be on display at the U.N. from Nov. 17-28."We think the exhibition could be a good presentation of the message the pope will give us in September 2015," when the annual U.N. General Assembly of world leaders meets, said Natalia Quintavalle, the consul general of Italy in New York.

http://www.vox.com/2015/8/1/9081337/antibiotics-meat	Excessive use of antibiotics in livestock is creating huge problems. Here’s how to fix it.	Originally published on Grist.You’ve probably heard some controversy about antibiotics being used on farm animals — what’s the deal?First, it’s important to clarify what we’re actually worried about. If you’re grossed out by the idea of antibiotics in your meat, don’t worry, that isn’t really the issue. Since some people are allergic to antibiotics, the USDA already inspects meat to ensure it doesn’t contain any antibiotic residues, and animals have a required withdrawal period before slaughter so that the drugs can fully leave their system (1). Same with milk and eggs. Phew.Overusing antibiotics makes them work less well — including for peopleWhen he was 15, Sam Spits, now 22, contracted a drug-resistant strain of campylobacter that left him weakened and unable to play high school sports again. More people are questioning use of antibiotics in livestock saying it can increase the creation of drug-resistant pathogens. (Stacey Westcott/Chicago Tribune/MCT via Getty Images)What might keep you up at night, though, is the growing problem of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. About 23,000 people in the US, and 700,000 people globally, die each year of antibiotic-resistant infections. These infections are hardest to treat in vulnerable groups like cancer patients and in poor countries that don’t have the technologies and medicines to combat more complex infections. Bacteria evolve resistance as part of an inevitable biological process — we’ll never stop it. But we can accelerate it by making bad choices. Human medicine creates the most direct threat of bacteria evolving antibiotic resistance, but livestock are also a major reservoir for resistant bacteria."When it comes to bacteria, human and animal environments are inextricably linked," said Lance Price, a professor of public health at George Washington University. Drug-resistant bacteria that develop in animals don’t necessarily stay there. But how do they get into humans? Hang on now, because it’s going to get a little gross: Bacteria in a cow’s gut can end up in manure that runs off into the water supply or taint meat when the animal is slaughtered. Even if we wash our hands and cook the meat, bacteria can still get onto surfaces and into our gastrointestinal tracts.The key, according to the doctors and vets I talked to, is to give bacteria the least number of opportunities to develop resistance. As long as we still use antibiotics, we won’t eliminate resistance entirely; it’s a problem we work on, not solve. That means using antibiotics as minimally as needed to fight bacterial infections and keep animals healthy. (The same is true for human medicine, by the way, so stop asking for antibiotics when you have a cold!)Using antibiotics to promote growth is on the way outPiglets born at the Orange County Fair huddle under a heat lamp in 2012. (Photo by Mark Boster/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)Taking antibiotics out of feeds has little effect in developed countriesIn the past, antibiotics were used fairly liberally in livestock feed to promote faster growth (Maureen Ogle has a great brief history on this). This practice is on the way out in the US, however, thanks to new FDA regulations and, frankly, because it doesn’t really work that well anymore. It turns out antibiotics only help animals grow better when other things like good nutrition and hygiene are lacking. Recent studies have shown that taking antibiotics out of feeds has little effect in developed countries, but may have a bigger impact in developing countries that don’t have advanced livestock sectors.This fits with what I heard from Larry Sailer, a commercial hog farmer in north central Iowa. He explained that today, he uses antibiotics only on pigs that are showing symptoms of illness, and after consulting with a vet. But he says this wasn’t the case 50 years ago, when they kept their pigs outdoors and they were more exposed to weather and pests. "I can’t say that I ever used antibiotics for growth promotion back then, but I was worried more," he told me, and explained that they used to use antibiotics more regularly than they do now.Banning all antibiotics in livestock isn't the solutionCow licks its lips after eating at John Fiscalini's Dairy and Cheese factory, where manure waste is turned into methane gas. (Bob Chamberlin/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)Gail Hansen of the Pew Antibiotic Resistance Project said she welcomes the new FDA regulations that will ban growth promotion. However, she warned that the regulations, which limit antibiotics to uses "necessary for assuring animal health," could leave the door open for antibiotics to still be used routinely for disease prevention, rather than treatment. "Preventive use isn’t always bad," says Hansen. If you have 6,000 chickens in a barn and some of them are sick, you may have to treat the whole flock preventively. However, the regulations should be tightened so that preventive use doesn’t become scheduled, routine use.The doctors, vets, and farmers I talked to all agreed that antibiotics should be used carefully under the supervision of a vet and not as a substitute for good animal nutrition and hygiene. They also agreed that banning them entirely would be bad for animal welfare. As livestock veterinarian Jen Trout puts it, "Just as I don’t forgo medical attention for my children when they’re sick, I don’t forgo prescribing antibiotic treatment to an animal when it’s necessary."Another area of agreement was around ionophores, a class of antibiotics that are used in animals, but not humans. These drugs make up about 40 percent of the antibiotics given to animals in the US. When it comes to the resistance problem, the experts I talked to said ionophores are a low priority issue because they have never been used in humans. As we focus on reducing the use of medically important antibiotics, ionophores are a good option for the industry.Bacteria don't care about national bordersA seller sleeping next to a cage in a poultry market in southwest China's Guizhou province. (STR/AFP/Getty Images)Although the US may be turning the corner on antibiotics use in animals, we aren’t the only ones using these drugs. China is already the largest consumer of antibiotics for livestock, and Brazil and India are in the top five. Global use of antibiotics in animals is expected to grow by two-thirds by 2030, and much of that growth will be in developing countries. Since bacteria don’t have borders, the US and Europe need to encourage the right kind of antibiotics use in these burgeoning livestock industries abroad. Antibiotics use in livestock will increase as developing countries adopt more advanced practices, so the key is to minimize the resistance pressure and ensure they are used prudently for health reasons, not growth promotion or unspecified "prevention."We also need better monitoring of how and when antibiotics are administered (to humans and animals) so we can better fight antibiotic resistance. If we can track when and how doctors and vets prescribe antibiotics, and where resistant infections develop, our public health will be safer.Antibiotics are a crucial tool in both human and animal medicine, and overusing them threatens their effectiveness. But a lot of the attention on the livestock issue has been around a move towards "antibiotic-free" meat, which misses the point. After all, animals raised in an "antibiotic-free" program still have to be treated with antibiotics if they get sick; they will just wind up in the conventional market if they do. As with so many hot-button issues, the answer lies in the middle: responsible antibiotics use, not a blanket ban. That way we can keep our animals healthy, while also making sure our "miracle drugs" keep working in the future.Marian Swain is a Conservation Analyst at the Breakthrough Institute in Oakland, California, where she researches global land use, food, and agriculture issues.

http://www.examiner.com/article/statue-of-an-elongated-head-identified-by-nasa-mars-rover-photo	Statue of an elongated head identified by NASA in Mars Rover photo	Statue of elongated head found on Mars with blue, white and red arrows inserted by NASA. Yellow arrow with magnification of elongated head inserted by author. NASA/JPL/Michael SallaOne of Mars rovers photographed what appears to be a stone statue of an elongated head on the Martian surface which, surprisingly, NASA had identified as an anomaly of interest. In a post released today on UFO Sightings Daily, Scott Waring described the stone anomaly as a “Face on Mars.” NASA had pointed out the apparent head statue along with other stone anomalies with different color arrows. This helped bring it to Waring’s attention, who claims that the head was likely part of a larger statue that was broken apart during some past cataclysmic event. The clarity of the head and face is stunning. This makes it difficult to dismiss Waring’s conclusion that the photo is powerful evidence of a past civilization on Mars.The photo was taken during the Mars Pathfinder Mission and the original is available on the photojournal of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) website. Here is JPL's explanation for what the different current arrows in the photo mean.The top image is a view to the northeast of the lander and is annotated to show the variety of rocks in this landing site and what they tell us. The red arrows point to rounded boulders and rocks, thought to have been shaped by the forces of water in flood (rough edges knocked off by the tumbling action of the water). The blue arrows indicate rocks with sharp edges and points, most probably ejected from nearby impact craters and/or ancient volcanic activity. The white areas (of which Scooby Doo is one) are believed to be deposits left behind by evaporating water, or aggregates of materials fused together by the action of water.NASA JPL photo analysts had concluded that the apparent statue of a head was likely a rock that had been created either from a meteor impact or ancient volcanic activity. Another possible explanation, not mentioned by NASA JPL, is that the stone anomaly was part of a larger statue that had been carved during a past Martian civilization, and subsequently destroyed during cataclysmic events.Curiously, the apparent stone head photographed by the Pathfinder Mission appears to be elongated. In a photo taken by the Curiosity Rover Mission on September 14, 2014, an apparent elongated human skull was found on Mars. Was the ancient civilization on Mars populated by people with elongated skulls? If so, there may be a connection with elongated human skull artifacts found in ancient Egypt and South America.It’s surprising that NASA’s JPL website would bring attention to the stone anomaly with an arrow. This certainly brought it to Waring’s attention. Perhaps someone in NASA’s JPL wanted to alert the public to the anomaly, whose clarity is very suggestive that it was artificially created by an ancient race of Martians with elongated skulls.

AirAsia Flight 8501 vanished in airspace possibly thick with dense storm clouds, strong winds and lightning on its way from Surabaya, Indonesia, to Singapore. Searchers had to fight against heavy rain. The Malaysia-based carrier&#39;s loss comes on top of the still-unexplained disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in March and the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in July over Ukraine. At the Surabaya airport, shocked family members pored over the plane&#39;s manifest, crying and embracing when they learned the news.

On the heels of that comes an announcement from Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx today, underscoring the importance of progress in safety-technology features. Foxx revealed that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration plans to add both crash-imminent braking and dynamic brake support to its list of ‘recommended’ advanced safety features. Both are part of what the federal agency terms automatic emergency braking systems, systems that can intevene and automatically apply the brakes or add to braking effort in order to anticipate an imminent collision and either lessen its severity or avoid it entirely.0:36WochitOne of Renee Zellweger&#39;s most recent pictures features one of America&#39;s favorite leading ladies having coffee with a friend in Santa Monica.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/archive/2005/05/why-i-support-j.html	Why I Support John Bolton	I know this may not sound politically correct, but as someone who has abused and tormented employees and underlings for years, I am dismayed by all of this yammering directed at John Bolton. Let's face it, the people who are screaming the loudest at Bolton have never been a boss and have no idea what it's like to deal with nitwits as dumb as themselves all day long. Why, even this morning my moronic assistant handed me a cup of coffee with way too much milk in it. I was incensed. "You stupid ignoramus," I screamed, doing all I could to restrain myself from tossing the luke-warm liquid in her face. "There's too much freaking (I didn't say freaking) milk in here! What the freak is wrong with you?!" "I'm sorry, sir," she stammered. Like sorry's going to fix everything. I'm not interested in sorry. Sorry doesn't cut it with me. "Look, you idiot," I continued, "I wouldn't mind so much if you gave me too little milk. Little can be fixed. We can add to little." "Shall I get you another cup?" "No, I'll suck on my thumb. Yes, get me another cup, you douche bag! And chew on this -- it's going to cost you a dollar!" This, of course, brought on the requisite tears. At which point I'd had enough and began chasing her down the hall where she took refuge in the bathroom. Boo-hoo. Poor thing! Meanwhile, I'm the one who had to go into the kitchen and make my own coffee! And guess what? I missed a very important phone call from this masseuse whom I'd been trying to get an appointment with forever!! (Sorry about all the exclamation points, but you can see how worked up I get over this Bolton business!) There is one thing, though, I'll guarantee: that will be the last time she puts in too much milk. So get to work, Bolton. Show these other countries who's the boss.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jordan-schultz/why-the-dallas-cowboys-are-not-for-real_b_5976694.html	Why The Dallas Cowboys Are Not For Real	On the heels of the most impressive win of the Jason Garrett era and of this NFL season, the 5-1 Dallas Cowboys sit tied atop the NFC East after out-Seahawking the Seattle Seahawks 30-23 Sunday. For a franchise that has been mired in mediocrity, coming out only four games over .500 during the last 16 seasons, the win was as much a statement to itself as it was to the rest of the league.The win came after Dallas fell behind 10-0 to the defending Super Bowl champs, who had won 17 of their previous 18 home games. That's the good. But with the good comes the bad: Not all is perfect with Dallas -- far from it, actually.The win in Seattle had nearly as much to do with Seahawks offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell's ineptitude as it did with anything else. Bevell gave his stud running back Marshawn Lynch the ball a mere 10 times, including just once on back-to-back plays. The dominant Seahawks defense of last season is long gone, most notably in the secondary, where Byron Maxwell and Kam Chancellor have been unable to repeat their stellar play. To its credit, Dallas exposed this, just as San Diego did several weeks ago. And Tony Romo, despite coming off a second severe back surgery, has been terrific even at 34 years old, ranking third in completion percentage to go along with his 11 touchdown passes.But the most glaring flaw with the Cowboys is a subpar rushing defense that ranks 17th in yards allowed and didn't shut down Lynch as much as Bevell did. While players and coaches preach a more physical approach, the statistics tell us that teams are continually able to run the ball when they stay committed to it. Houston's Arian Foster ripped Dallas for 157 yards and two touchdowns on 23 carries; New Orleans totaled over 100 yards on the ground in limited work; and St. Louis went well over the 100-yard mark, as did San Francisco. When the Dallas front lost DeMarcus Ware to Denver in free agency, along with its best linebacker, Sean Lee, to a season-ending knee injury in the preseason, it was fair to expect the NFL's worst defense from 2013 would once again struggle. A marked improvement has taken place, but this is not a special defense by any metric.Part of what makes a great defense is a ball-controlled offense. The thought process is simple, yet can be highly effective: Keep the defense rested, control the clock with tempo, and force the opposing offense to do things differently because it's not on the field. Through six games, that has been Garrett's philosophy, and it has worked seamlessly. Murray (pictured above) is on a near-record pace for both yards and carries, and his sixth consecutive 100-yard rushing game makes him the only player other than Jim Brown ever to open a season with those numbers. Against Seattle, the Cowboys doubled their time of possession, limiting Wilson and the Seahawks offense to play almost a form of "catch-up" in terms of play differential.When we think of the Cowboys, we think of Jerry Jones' ludicrous statements, overpriced contracts and the classic Tony Romo blowup. We think of a team with a comedy of errors that finds ways to lose games when it shouldn't, and a team that has needed a win to close each of the last three seasons, only to lose and miss the playoffs every time. Sunday's win in Seattle may very well have signaled a changing of the guard -- Jones even tabbed it Garrett's "best day as a Cowboy" -- but it shouldn't overshadow the team's flaws either, most notably a below-average rushing defense that surely will disappoint down the road.Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com or ask me questions about anything sports-related at @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram @Schultz_Report.

https://www.yahoo.com/beauty/9-tips-for-women-with-thinning-hair-103583691378.html	9 Tips for Women With Thinning Hair	Photo: Pol Baril/Trunk ArchiveThere’s a life-changing beauty moment in the lives of many women that’s bigger than finding your first gray hair or fine line: the moment you discover your hair is thinning. While it’s often the only cosmetic problem men talk about as they lean toward middle age, it’s rarely considered a female problem—even though a Harvard Medical School report says that one-third of women will experience hair loss in their lifetime. So let’s talk about it. First of all, what causes women to lose their hair? “Certain medications can cause hair loss: vitamin A, anticoagulants, hormones, and even antidepressants,” says Dr. Gervaise Gerstner, L’Oréal Paris Consulting Dermatologist. “Additionally, environmental and artificial stressors like hair straightening and coloring can cause hair loss, as well as health issues such as thyroid problems, anemia and hormonal changes. But the issue is mostly hereditary. We call it androgenetic alopecia.” Dr. Gerstner says a series of tests can be conducted to get to the root of the problem, and that’s when you can start searching for a solution. Medical Solutions“We have plenty of options at our disposal to help women who are dealing with thinning hair and hair loss: Biotin, Viviscal and Aviva hair supplements work very well, as do steroid scalp injections,” says Dr. Gerstner. “There are also hair transplants, which can take many hours and are very costly. Some of the plugs take, some don’t.” She recommends seeking a top physician if you decide on this route. Related: Everything You Need to Know About At-Home ColorTopical ProductsTopical products can be very effective. Women’s Rogaine now comes in a foam formula that can be applied once daily for fast and easy hair growth stimulation. Other products, like the Redken Cerafill Retaliate line, include a minoxidil topical hair regrowth treatment along with daily hair care products that stimulate the scalp and support regrowth. If your hair loss is temporary—due to anything from stress to pregnancy—products like Phyto Phytocane Revitalizing Serum ($65) can help stimulate your scalp.Get a HaircutThe transformative powers of a good hairstyle can’t be denied, but the word “cut” can be scary. “Most women don’t want to sacrifice any hair, but a chic, stylish cut can change your look and minimize the appearance of hair loss,” explains says Jill Crosby, celebrity stylist and spokesperson for Women’s Rogaine. “Hanging onto to uneven hair can make the problem look worse. The right cut can create weight lines as a visual indicator of weight and volume, which is exactly what you need: the illusion of depth.”Change Your ColorAlso, don’t be afraid of color. “Color offers a really welcome aesthetic and emotional change. It also adds dimension to a cut and volume since color expands the cuticle of the hair,” says Crosby. “Go to someone who really understands chemical processes so they can take care of your hair while they’re processing.” She adds that this isn’t the time to experiment at home. “I don’t recommend just grabbing a box of color. The wrong hair color can make the thinning problem appear worse. Women often go dark with home color, which is a no-no if you have fair skin; it makes the hair loss stand out. You want to enhance your skin tone so that the thinning is less noticeable.”

By the end of October, GM had sold less than 19,000 of its Chevy Volts, down almost 3% from last year. Ford sells fewer than 200 Ford Focus Electric vehicles each month. Both companies offer steep discounts to lure in buyers.Would Tesla be a good fit for GM as Harris suggested? The luxury electric vehicle maker currently has a market capitalization of more than $18 billion, after shares rose more than 5% on Tuesday on news that its Model S had kept its five-star safety rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. A few reported engine fires in the Model S had spooked investors. The share price fell more than 20% from its peak back in September.Tesla reported a record 5,500 Model S deliveries in its third quarter, as well as record production, a rising gross margin and expansion of its stores, service centers and charging stations. Per-share earnings have been better than consensus estimates in the past three quarters. But share trades at a hefty 100-plus times forward earnings.Still, as Harris said, there would be no reason for GM to reinvent the wheel when it comes to electric vehicle technology. The Model S is critically acclaimed, while the Chevy Volt has had its own issues with car fires. But it all may come down to the valuation of Tesla — and whether CEO Elon Musk is ready to part with it and move on to his next project.Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1c94bvR
http://www.voanews.com/content/obama-fights-ebola-political-fallout/2487679.html	Obama Battles Political Fallout of Ebola	President Barack Obama is working not only to stop the spread of Ebola in the United States, but to contain the political damage that fear of the disease could inflict on his Democratic Party.Fears of Ebola have become a factor as Americans prepare to go to the polls next month in Congressional elections that could see Democrats losing control of the Senate.   One person has died of Ebola on U.S. soil, a Liberian visitor. Two nurses who came in contact with him are sick. The number is miniscule when compared to the more than 4,000 people who have died of the disease in West Africa.The three cases have triggered a wave of criticism against the administration by some Americans, however,  who accuse the leadership of not doing enough to protect them.Damage controlThe president who has been criticized in the past for golfing and fundraising during major crises, recently cancelled some domestic trips and instead stayed at the White House to  meet with members of his Ebola response team. After one of those meetings, the president invited cameras into the Oval Office and offered the American people words of reassurance.“I understand that people are scared. But what I want to emphasize once again is that right now we’ve got one individual who came in with the disease.”In his remarks, Obama sought to contain the political damage that could result from Americans’ anxiety over Ebola.“It’s important for all of us to keep perspective in terms of how we handle this. We are taking this very seriously at the highest levels -- starting with me,” said the president.Obama’s approval ratings have already suffered; polls last month showed many Americans are not happy with his handling of foreign policy issues including the threat posed by Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.Upcoming electionsPolitical analysts say the Ebola issue could make Democrats vulnerable going into next month’s elections.Julian Zelizer, a politics professor at Princeton University and fellow at the New America Foundation, speaking via Skype, says Ebola could end up being this year’s so-called “October Surprise,” a jargon term used to describe news that is deliberately released in time to influence the outcome of November elections.“It is a surprise. It’s not a surprise that anyone constructed, but it is a surprise that the president needs to deal with and that the Democrats need to deal with," said Zelizer. "It’s creating a sense of crisis. It’s raising questions about government and that will all point to problems, I think, for the Democratic Party. So, I think, fairly or not fairly, it’s something that’s going to be part of the campaign now.”Republicans have accused the Democratic administration of not taking adequate measures. They call for a travel ban, which the administration says would do more harm than good.Democrats, in a series of campaign ads, have accused Republicans of undermining efforts to fight Ebola by supporting cuts to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention.Ebloa 'czar' namedMeanwhile, the president on Friday named a former White House official as Ebola "czar" to coordinate U.S. efforts to fight the virus. The White House said Ron Klain, a former aide to two vice presidents, will take the role.Obama had mentioned the possibility of an Ebola czar on Thursday, when he authorized additional military forces to help with containment efforts in West Africa. He also authorized National Guard and reservist troops as part of the U.S. commitment to deploy 4,000 American soldiers to fight Ebola at its source in West Africa.The president plans to resume fundraising activities in the coming days, which some see as an indication that he believes the uproar over Ebola could soon start to fade.Analysts say Obama and his party are hoping the number of cases in the U.S. does not rise significantly before next month’s elections.

(AP) — A 71-year-old woman who went to get help for her husband after he fell getting out of their vehicle has been found dead near their home, state police said.The couple was returning from a shopping trip Monday night when Stewart Little fell and wasn't able to stand up, police said. His wife, Patricia, decided to walk to a neighbor's house for help.After some time, Stewart Little managed to crawl into the living room of their Irasburg home but couldn't reach a phone to call 911, police said. A family member who stopped by the home Wednesday discovered that Stewart Little was suffering from an undisclosed medical problem and that Patricia Little was missing, police said.After troopers and a canine unit arrived, a dog found Patricia Little dead in a field between her home and the neighbors'.

J.P. Sinclair told WCAX-TV."It's obviously tragic — very, very sad. We certainly wish it could've ended differently," Sinclair said.Stewart Little was taken to a hospital and is expected to recover.

http://www.businessinsider.com/european-parliament-voted-to-break-up-google-2014-11	The European Parliament Just Voted To Break Up Google	GOOGLE-GLASS/ REUTERS/Stephen LamGoogle Inc co-founder Sergey Brin arrives on the red carpet during the 2nd Annual Breakthrough Prize Awards at the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California, November 9, 2014.The European Parliament has passed a historic vote to break up US tech giant Google.The EU doesn't actually have the power to break up the company, but it does send a message to Google that the EU is unhappy with its business practises. Legislators in Strasbourg voted 458 to 173 in favour of the proposal.The European Parliament has never voted to break up a company before, making this a historic decision. The antitrust commission is concentrating on four areas of investigation:The way Google displays its search services compared to its competitors. How Google uses content from other websites. Google's dominance over advertising on search terms. Restrictions that surround how advertisers can move their campaigns to other search engines.There's no specific mention of Google in the vote, but the decision makes it clear that the EU is unhappy with its search engine's dominance. Google has been the subject of a four-year anti-trust investigation in Europe, which still hasn't reached a conclusion.It's unlikely that Europe will try and separate Google's search business from its other products, but the strong message could lead to a resolution in the anti-trust dispute. Google has suggested a series of concessions, but all have been rejected. If the dispute continues, Google could face a fine of up to $5 billion.In a statement released to the media, the draft bill's authors explained the reasoning behind their decision:In case the proceedings against Google carry on without any satisfying decisions and the current anti-competitive behaviour continues to exist, a regulation of the dominant online web search should be envisaged.Google dominates the European search engine market, with 90% of web searches passing through Google Search. That's a far bigger share of the market than the US, where Google accounts for 68% of searches.Twitter/Andreas SchwabAndreas Schwab is one of the authors of the billThe US company has already tried to work with European companies to try and ease their worries about its service.In October, Google removed thumbnail images and snippets of text from news results belonging to a group of German newspapers. The publisher, Axel Springer, was angry that Google was reposting its content to enhance search results. But the German publishing group later scrapped its plan to reduce its Google results to headlines after traffic plummeted.A letter published by Axel Springer chief executive Mathias Döpfner claimed that German publishers are "afraid of Google" because of its dominance.
http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/can-we-please-stop-flippantly-dismissing-the-athleticism-of-white-guys-that-play-pro-basketball-195458743.html	Stop dismissing the athleticism of white guys who play NBA ball	By now you’ve already read Dan Devine’s terrific re-telling of the night when Dirk Nowitzki passed Hakeem Olajuwon on the NBA’s all-time scoring list, making him the most prolific internationally born scorer in the league’s history. Nowitzki’s accomplishments are lengthy, moving well beyond the tangible marks like the 2011 championship ring or 2007 NBA MVP; remember, Dirk entered the league in 1999 with a skill set that nobody seemed sure of what to do with, up and to and at times even including forward-thinking Dallas Mavericks coach and personnel chief Don Nelson.Two years after Nowitzki’s debut, and a few months after Dirk helped lead the Mavs to their first playoff berth in 11 years, the stage was set for Memphis Grizzlies rookie Pau Gasol to dominate. Gasol wasn’t as focused on the perimeter as Nowitzki; he in many ways was the classic low post banger that the league was and still is lacking, but the acceptance of the foreign-born big man that Nowitzki helped encourage did influence the Grizzlies franchise to send orthodox, old school-styled 20-point scorer in Shareef Abdur-Rahim to Atlanta for a 20-year old that averaged only around 12 points and six rebounds for his Spanish League team the year before.Two rings and endless amounts of plaudits later, Gasol is still going strong in Chicago. Nowitzki, meanwhile, is still the lead dog on a Mavericks squad that is looking to make yet another lengthy playoff run.And yet, on Monday night, this is what we got:“I came up with a shot where I just have to basically lean back, don’t be athletic at all and just hoist it up,” said Nowitzki.“I came up with my own ‘Dream Shake’ I guess — the white version.”Kobe on AD: "He's an athletic Pau Gasol. That's the best way I can put it. He can be one of the greatest power forwards who has ever played"— Bill Oram (@billoram) November 12, 2014Now, make no mistake – these are two flip statements made by smart guys that were just goofing around.Dirk, even dating back to his introductory news conference/barbeque (seriously) with the Mavericks in 1998 (his first game wouldn’t come until after the NBA settled its labor dispute in 1999) has always been the master of the self-deprecating quip. Also, the dude is white – he’s allowed to say whatever he wants about white dudes.Secondly, with the possible exception of the white dude writing this column and maybe the great Chelsea Peretti, absolutely nobody on this planet respects Pau Gasol more than Kobe Bean Bryant. Bryant would give up just about every one of his Italian-made supercars for another chance at playing alongside Gasol, who turned down more money from the Lakers to go play for a potential championship contender in Chicago last July.These are jokes, we get it.Still … Dirk Nowitzki and Pau Gasol are super freaking athletic, guys.You don’t run up and down the court with the greatest athletes in the world for a decade and a half or longer without being “athletic.” You’re not going to be able to shoot a 25-foot shot at a 10-foot goal after stopping on a dime while lunging backward and into the air without being “athletic.” You’re not going to be able to back down 7-footers in the paint or hit a cutter with a no-look pass without utilizing a whole hell of a lot of athleticism.Can Anthony Davis jump higher than Pau Gasol ever could? Yep. Was Hakeem Olajuwon’s spin cycle “Dream Shake” run with the tachometer in the red? No doubt.What we’re also doing here, however, is denying both Davis and Hakeem’s brilliance in a way. Again, Dirk and Kobe were just having fun, but Hakeem’s high and low post intelligence was way ahead of its time. And while Davis still has his 21-and-under struggles sometimes, his ability to do just about everything expertly on the basketball court reminds of a Pau Gasol-type. That can jump higher.This screed isn’t aimed at Dirk or Kobe, two legends that have forgotten more about basketball than we’ll ever know. This is aimed at the writers, radio hosts, cable guys and fans that take this too-easy route too often. Larry Bird was never in the Dunk Contest, but he was a 6-foot-9 guy that could run for days and do amazing things with the basketball with those hands of his. Nick Collison can’t touch the shot clock after jumping off of one foot, but after Oklahoma City Thunder's practice today this non-shooter will hit trick shots that the best shooter on your high school team couldn’t make after a 100 tries. Ryan Anderson is more athletic than anyone you’ve ever met, unless you’ve met Dirk Nowitzki.Dirk Nowitzki (obviously) and Pau Gasol (as was relayed on Tuesday) absolutely do not care about being referred to in these terms, but can’t we do better?I dunno. I’m probably just cranky because I can’t get rim.- - - - - - -Kelly Dwyer is an editor for Ball Don't Lie on Yahoo Sports. Have a tip? Email him at KDonhoops@yahoo.com or follow him on Twitter!

It’s all real this year. Everything is true – I actually love her!”Unfortunately that was not enough for ABC as ABC News took over The View from the entertainment division on October 30th and Rosie does not have the dominance over them that she once enjoyed with ABC Entertainment.The new bosses tested the waters recently and had Behar come on to promote her new one-woman off-Broadway show ‘Me, My Mouth and I’ to see how viewers would respond. The feedback was tremendous.Now ABC News brass has approached the two about returning in a more permanent capacity as they are losing viewers in the all important 18-34 age group, recently beaten by both The Wendy Williams Show and The Real in the critical demographic.This article was written for Business 2 Community by Andrew Lopata.

Wouldn't it be good to know where to really concentrate our efforts so we can give our marriages the best chance at survival?Here are six marriage mistakes that can easily lead to divorce:1. You talk to friends about the rotten thing you think your husband did to you. Research suggests that friends are often more upset when they think their bestie is being mistreated than when they're experiencing the same mistreatment themselves. Besides, most of us don't really understand how our conditioning and wiring as women differs from our husbands' conditioning and wiring as men. That's why conversations about men with female friends often lead to husband-bashing, which helps nobody. The solution is to limit talking about your marital problems to just two people: For example, a trusted friend along with a coach or therapist. (See what a coach at The Relationship Place has to offer here.)2. You think that talking about these problems with your husband is the answer. All too often, women think that talking to our husbands is the way to make them see how their behavior affects us. If the behavior doesn't change when we first bring it up, we want to talk more, longer, or louder because we think maybe they didn't get it the first time. One of the biggest pet peeves for men is that feeling of being nagged or badgered, especially if they don't know what the problem really is. Also, the rules of polite, kind, nice conversation that women try to follow often come off as indirect, manipulative and mysterious to men. Women often conclude that their husbands don't care because they haven't changed after a particular conversation. The solution: learn communication skills designed specifically to talk with men and spend more time doing fun activities.3. You believe that your happiness depends on your husband changing. Research has shown that happiness does increase when your husband changes for the better, but that change originates with you. Paradoxically, the women who focused on becoming the person they want to be, rather than on how to get their husband to change, were happier down the road. The solution: focus on being the best you. To understand more about the art and science of being happy, check out my class here.4. You live parallel lives. Living parallel lives with your husband is the slippery slope to disconnecting completely. The bonds of marriage thrive on having interest in one another, working toward common goals and spending time with one another. Couples who are trying to reconnect after their children have left home often come to realize that they don't know each other anymore. The solution: take the time to know what's important to your husband and let him know what's important to you.5. You focus on what's wrong. One of the most difficult scenarios I come across is a couple in which one or both people are stuck viewing each other through a negative lens, expecting the worst. Our brains do a wonderful job of seeing what we expect to see, and we are much more likely to view our husbands as doing everything wrong when we have developed a negative view of them. A relationship coach can help you regain a balanced view. The solution: balance your concerns with a positive view. A relationship thrives when we see our partner through rose-colored glasses.6. You utter these deadly words: "I deserve ... " These words need to be banned from your vocabulary. The mentality that goes along with using these words includes a form of entitlement that kills the softness needed for a couple to cherish one another. Saying "I deserve" is inherently a demand. It's very different from knowing internally that you are worth more, and having the communication skills necessary to ask for more. Knowing what you're worth helps you inspire your husband to cherish you. The solution: focus on knowing your own worth. Get clear about what's important to you in a relationship, and learn how to ask for it.More Stories On YourTango: Women Should Be 'Submissive' To Their Husband, Says Which Celeb?

http://news.yahoo.com/details-shed-light-canada-killings-230632533.html	Canadian who killed eight spared two infants	Montreal (AFP) - A Canadian who murdered eight people including his wife spared two infants during his deadly rampage, police said, while reports emerged that he had previously threatened his family.Police are still investigating the motive behind the killing spree last week in Edmonton by 53-year-old Phu Lam, a man of Vietnamese origin.But the new details shed some light into what may have prompted the killings that shocked the northern capital of the oil-rich province of Alberta at the end of December.Last Sunday, Lam killed his wife Tien Truong, 35, her eight-year-old son, her parents, her sister, her three-year-old niece and an acquaintance of Truong's.At a different location the next day, Lam killed a 37-year-old woman who police say was a friend of the family and likely was not Lam's intended target.Lam, who was believed to be depressed, later took his own life at a Vietnamese restaurant where he worked.Two years ago, Lam had threatened to kill his family, according to a legal complaint filed by his wife.Truong accused Lam of repeated violence over the years, according to court documents reported by the local press.Lam threatened to kill the whole family after learning through a biological test that he was not the father of Elvis Lam, the eight-year-old victim, the complaint said.Teachers described Elvis as "quiet and kind" who would be missed greatly by his peers.Lam also had a record of sexual assault and drug use with Edmonton police.During a press conference Friday, police said there were two young children that Lam spared during his spree, leaving them at a relative's house before killing again.The children were aged one and the other was eight months old. They may have been related to Lam, local media reported."There's a very good possibility that those two young children were in the house, in the north end, when the homicides took place," Deputy Police Chief Mark Neufeld said."For whatever reason, the two children were spared."

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/royal-caribbeans-newest-ship-built-110003531.html	Royal Caribbean's newest ship was built to lure people who hate cruising	Step aboard the newest ship in Royal Caribbean Cruises’ fleet and you’ll find muted earth tone carpets, glass elevator doors, dark woods. Remove the gangways—and the need for a passport—and this area on Quantum of the Seas could be easily be a tony residential tower in Frankfurt or Manhattan.“We decided early on that it would have a different look … we created a more sophisticated design,” says Richard Fain, Royal Caribbean’s chairman and chief executive officer.The subdued design is just one element the cruise line has deployed on the new ship, which carries 4,180 passengers and 1,500 crew members. Quantum of the Seas is, in many respects, the first cruise ship designed for people who hate cruising. After a two-year period marked by intense media focus on cruise fires, fatal groundings, and virus outbreaks, the cruise industry is keen to mount a full-scale assault on the stereotypes that keep millions of people from considering a vacation at sea.Royal Caribbean has two more Quantum-class ships on order for its fleet, with Anthem of the Seas arriving next fall, and a third, dubbed Ovation, in late 2016. All three are much smaller than the line’s two Oasis-class behemoths, which each carry more than 6,000 people per sailing. Quantum of the Seas will spend the winter sailing from New Jersey before relocating in the spring to Shanghai, the first brand new ship from a U.S. line to enter the market in China.The Quantum employs some technologies that are relatively new to the industry, such as bag tagging that lets passengers use smartphones to track the location of luggage from drop-off at the pier until it reaches their cabins. Reservations for dinner and further activities are made on tablets around the ship, and waiters are expected to record a diner’s preferences via that technology so that other dining venues will know how you take your coffee or whether you prefer red or white wine, Fain says. The satellite-based Wi-Fi onboard is fairly speedy for sea-based system.There also are activities aimed at younger cruisers, who often might prefer a land vacation where they can hike, surf, or golf. At the rear of Quantum‘s  Deck 16, 11 decks above that chic boarding area, an attraction using high-speed jets of water allows passengers to surf or water board. Cruisers can “skydive” in a vertical wind tunnel that simulates the sensation of free falling. And a glass capsule extends 300 feet into the air, allowing 360-degree views. A rock climbing wall—beside a 30-foot pink bear—is right around the aft corner, one deck below. Also on Deck 15 are some other Royal Caribbean trademark activities, including the bumper car arcade, the full-sized basketball court, the roller skating rink, and the circus school.Pretending to jump from an airplane while cruising the Caribbean “conveys in a very dramatic way, and it’s something that busts old stereotypes about what a cruise is,” Fain, a 35-year company veteran, said on Wednesday afternoon while slurping a vanilla milkshake from Johnny Rockets, the fast-food diner found in 30 states and on a dozen RCL ships. “Obviously, this isn’t a sedentary vacation. It helps to raise that awareness, particularly in non-cruisers.”The prospect of a sedentary vacation at sea, surrounded by all-you-can-eat food, overpriced drinks, smoky casinos, and crowded pools repels millions of people the industry calls “cruise resisters.” This image of the typical cruise has been shaped over years among many people in North America and Europe. Recruiting that category represents the largest single opportunity for industry growth.With its many physically active on-board pursuits aimed at a younger crowd—some have described the Quantum-class ships as a bid for millennials—Quantum of the Seas was designed to overcome the negative perceptions.Ditching the traditional dining room is an additional tactic: A variety of 18 restaurants, booked by iPad or in one’s stateroom, serve different foods at night, furthering the notion that cruisers will try most of them over a seven or 10-night cruise.Royal Caribbean has also redesigned its traditional buffet area, where most cruisers congregate for breakfast and lunch. The Quantum‘s buffet, on Deck 14, is called the Windjammer Marketplace; the offerings assigned to various stations are sorted by cuisine, such as pan-Asian, antipasti, American favorites, and sandwiches.

It felt like progress to Dalbesio, who told Elle: "I'm in the middle. I'm not skinny enough to be with the skinny girls and I'm not large enough to be with the large girls and I haven't been able to find my place. This [campaign] was such a great feeling."But the campaign courted online rage yesterday when Dalbesio was described as a plus-size model by outlets like Entertainment Tonight. Tweets to Calvin Klein read: "WTF @CalvinKlein --this is your "plus-size model"?" and "That's not a plus size! You guys need to rethink what a plus-size is."
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/09/fidel-castro-dead-rumors-_n_6443268.html	Rumors Of Fidel Castro's Death Circulate After Prolonged Absence From Public Life	Once again rumors of the death of former Cuban leader Fidel Castro have spread across the exile community and across social media.El Diario de las Américas, a Florida-based publication read mostly by Cuban exiles, reported Thursday that the Cuban government had called a press conference amid speculation about Castro’s health. The Cuban government later disputed the report, saying no such press event had been planned, according to AFP’s correspondent in Havana.The Cuban government’s lack of transparency and the lack of an independent mass media on the island have long provided fertile ground for rumor’s of 88-year-old Castro’s death since he fell ill in 2006.Since the reports on Thursday Twitter has been abuzz with rumors of his death, though they have not yet been confirmed.As Univision news anchor Jorge Ramos warned, this is not the first time Fidel Castro’s alleged death has taken over the internet. In 2012 rumors of his death began circulating after news that Venezuelan doctor, Jose Rafael Marquina, said the former leader had suffered cardiac arrest and was in a vegetative state.“Careful. Remember that here in Miami, almost like a ritual, Fidel Castro is killed several times a year” Ramos wrote on Twitter.Thursday marked one year since Castro’s last public appearance, according to Fox News Latino. His absence at major events like the 56th anniversary this week of Castro’s entry into Havana after the victory of the Cuban Revolution or the return last month of three Cubans convicted of spying in the U.S. have led some to believe that his health has worsened. Castro has yet to comment on the historic resumption of diplomatic relations with the United States for the first time since 1961, announced by both governments last month. The most recent "Reflection," as Fidel Castro's columns are called, appeared in October 2014.Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was the last head of state to meet with Castro in August 2014 and published photos of their meeting. Maduro stated that he found Castro had an “impressive lucidity, an impressive train of thought and exceptional wisdom.”Adding to the confusion, Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga’s son, Fidel Castro Odinga, was found dead in his home in Nairobi on Jan. 4.Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that Fidel Castro's last column was published in August 2013. It was actually published in October 2014.

Why are they ok to print? — Judd Apatow (@JuddApatow) diciembre 11, 2014There’s a valid comparison to be made here, and Apatow certainly isn’t the first to make it. Both cases involve invasions of privacy and high-profile figures enduring some degree of public shaming as a result—and in both cases, it would be a more ethical choice for the public to politely look away from the illegally obtained documents, no matter how juicy their contents may be, to discourage future attacks of a similar nature.But there’s a crucial difference between having your damaging jokes about someone else’s race exposed online without your permission and having your naked body exposed online without your permission, and it goes without saying which one is a graver threat to a person’s dignity. Not to mention that getting publicly shamed for an act that’s generally considered hurtful and offensive isn’t the same as getting publicly shamed for what’s frequently a consensual act of affection.

http://news.yahoo.com/pro-hezbollah-singer-detained-lebanon-over-song-122631654.html	Pro-Hezbollah singer detained in Lebanon over song	BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanese authorities have detained a pro-Hezbollah singer over some of his songs, including one that calls Saudi Arabia a "terrorist," judicial officials and his father said Tuesday.Ali Barakat became known last year after releasing songs related to Syria's civil war, including one about the opposition stronghold of Yabroud that was captured earlier this year by Syrian troops and Hezbollah fighters.Barakat was detained Monday when he went to collect his passport from the General Directorate of General Security in the southern town of Nabatiyeh, his father Mohammed Barakhat said."This move violates democracy," Barakat said.In April, authorities issued a summons for Barakat over releasing sectarian songs that "harm Lebanon's relations" with Arab countries.An official close to Hezbollah said Barakat is not a member with the group."When we heard some of his songs that we found not suitable we objected," said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to journalists. "Still, he went on with them."Judicial officials said if charged and convicted, Barakat could get six months to three years in prisons for inciting sectarian sentiments and attacking a friendly country. They spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.Saudi Arabia is one of the main backers of Syrian rebels. Hezbollah has sent its fighters to back Syrian President Bashar Assad.Also Tuesday, Hezbollah announced that the group exchanged two members of Syria's al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front it held for Hezbollah fighter Imad Ayad, who was recently captured in Syria. The group did not identify the Nusra Front members it released.Ayad was the first Hezbollah member taken prisoner since the group openly joined Assad's forces.
http://news.yahoo.com/judge-boy-14-shouldnt-executed-sc-180633984.html	Judge: Boy, 14, shouldn't have been executed in SC	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — More than 70 years after South Carolina sent a 14-year-old black boy to the electric chair in the killings of two white girls in a segregated mill town, a judge threw out the conviction, saying the state committed a great injustice.George Stinney was arrested, convicted of murder in a one-day trial and executed in 1944 — all in the span of about three months and without an appeal. The speed in which the state meted out justice against the youngest person executed in the United States in the 20th century was shocking and extremely unfair, Circuit Judge Carmen Mullen wrote in her ruling Wednesday."I can think of no greater injustice," Mullen wrote.The girls, ages 7 and 11, were beaten badly in the head with an iron railroad spike in the town of Alcolu in Clarendon County, about 45 miles southeast of Columbia, authorities said. A search by dozens of people found their bodies several hours later.Investigators arrested Stinney, saying witnesses saw him with the girls as they picked flowers. He was kept away from his parents, and authorities later said he confessed.His supporters said he was a small, frail boy so scared that he said whatever he thought would make the authorities happy. They said there was no physical evidence linking him to the deaths. His executioners noted the electric chair straps didn't fit him, and an electrode was too big for his leg.During a two-day hearing in January, Mullen heard from Stinney's surviving brother and sisters, someone involved in the search and experts who questioned the autopsy findings and Stinney's confession. Most of the evidence from the original trial was gone and almost all the witnesses were dead.It took Mullen nearly four times as long to issue her ruling as it took in 1944 to go from arrest to execution.Stinney's case has long been whispered in civil rights circles in South Carolina as an example of how a black person could be railroaded by a justice system during the Jim Crow era where the investigators, prosecutors and juries were all white.The case received renewed attention because of a crusade by textile inspector and school board member George Frierson. Armed with a binder full of newspaper articles and other evidence, he and a law firm believed the teen represented everything that was wrong with South Carolina during the era of segregation.Frierson said he heard about the judge's decision from a co-worker. He had to attend a school board meeting later in the day, so the news hadn't sunk in yet."When I get home, I'm going to get on my knees and thank the Lord Almighty for being so good and making sure justice prevailed," Frierson said.Attorneys argued that Stinney should get a new trial, but Mullen went a step further by vacating Stinney's conviction. Her 29-page order included references to the 1931 Scottsboro Boys case in Alabama, where nine black teens were convicted of raping two white women. Eight of them were sentenced to death.The convictions were eventually overturned before the teens went to the death chamber and the charges were dropped. Mullen noted Stinney did not even get the consideration of an appeal.The judge was careful to say her ruling doesn't apply to other families who felt their relatives were discriminated against."The extraordinary circumstances discussed herein simply do not apply in most cases," Mullen wrote.___Follow Jeffrey Collins on Twitter at http://twitter.com/JSCollinsAP

He thought it was a bit strange since the night crew is apparently made up of kiss-asses who leave it nice and tidy for him.Thinking that someone had broken into the bar after his staff left for the night, Bevon decided to review the security footage, and that's when shit got real:According to legend, two children were playing in the pub's basement hundreds of years ago, but they died when it flooded sometime after their mother "went out."Maybe it's just us, but if all of those smashed glasses are a result of those two brats, then maybe it's safe to say they were drowned on purpose.Some nerd ghost refuses to leave his or her school: Is This The Ghost Of A Person Killed At Pocatello High School Roaming Its Halls?

The kindness of strangers. A building with Donald Trump's name on it. Good pizza. We like to think that somewhere, in each state, there's a truly sublime pie, and to prove that point, we've crunched the numbers (and the crusts) and come up with a definitive list of the best pizzerias in every corner of this great nation.We've already told you where you can find some truly superlative pies in the ol' US of A, but let's be honest: certain regions get a little more attention than others (we're looking at you, North Dakota). So now, we're opening up the playing field (to South Dakota... and everyone else). These are the best pizzerias in every state in America.More: Every State In The USA, Ranked By Its Food/DrinkALABAMAPost Office Pies (address and info) Birmingham When John Hall moved back to his hometown of Birmingham, he brought with him experience on the line at Manhattan's Gramercy Tavern, Per Se, and Momofuku, and, most importantly, the cred of operating an illegal pizza pop-up out of his NYC apartment. With two handmade brick ovens, crusts that took six months to perfect, and a bevy of house-made toppings, like sausage -- plus a brewery next door supplying the booze, Hall's spot is revolutionizing pizza in Bama's largest city.ALASKAMoose's Tooth Pizza and Pub (address and info) Anchorage Stunt pizzas can be a red flag, and Moose's Tooth has them in spades. And shrimp. And salmon. And bratwurst. But here's the thing: the stunts are as good as the mainstays, served up on a choice of thick or thin crust (get thick: it's cold outside) and paired up with house-made beer and sarsaparilla. The pies would make even Bill Seward's harshest critics reconsider the wealth of the Alaska Purchase.Credit: Pizza Bianco/Jennifer BuiARIZONAPizzeria Bianco (address and info) Phoenix This wasn't even close. Chris Bianco's legendary place, which arguably started the artisanal pizza trend, is the best pizza in AZ by several miles and has been for 25 years. ARKANSASZAZA (address and info) Little Rock, Conway A traditional American pizzeria this place is not: ZAZA specializes in Neapolitan stylings, and has some surprising toppings on their crispy wood-fired pies. They only use the finest Italian ingredients (like San Marzano tomatoes and doppio zero flour) to make specialty pizzas like the 3 Little Pigs with bacon, ham, and pepperoni. Also Italian and delicious: their gelato. CALIFORNIAPizzaiolo (address and info) Oakland California is tough. Not so much in the Southern part of the state, where Mozza reigns supreme, but in the SF area, there are a lot of contenders. So with respect to Una Pizza, Ragazza, Tony's, and Delfina, we're going with Pizzaiolo in Oakland. For nearly 10 years, Charlie Hallowell's East Bay joint has consistently put out fantastic Neapolitan/NorCal-style pizzas. Many have come close, and the argument could be made that some places have individual pies that are better, but no one has mastered that unique California style at such a high level for as long.COLORADOOsteria Marco (address and info) Denver One of Denver's premiere restaurateurs opened up this pizza place, and it's a passion project. Mozzarella is made in-house, and pizzas don't conform to any particular style -- it's all his own. CONNECTICUTFrank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana (address and info) Multiple locations We've pretty extensively explored Connecticut's pizza scene in the past, and it is unequivocally one of the best in the country. The best and most hotly debated places are located in New Haven, where warring coal-fired spots have duked it out for generations. But while Sally's is one of the premier pizzerias in the country, we still have to give the title to the OG New Haven apizza-slinger: Pepe's. Their white clam pie, served without tomato sauce, is a national treasure, simple as that. DELAWAREGrotto Pizza (address and info) Multiple locations The legend started in 1960, when Dominick Pulieri and his brother-in-law and sister came to Delaware to open a pizzeria. And despite the fact that people in Delaware in the '60s were like "wait, what's pizza again?", they've prospered and expanded, thanks to their now-signature swirl of sauce above the cheese. Some fancier folk may oppose this choice, as it is certainly not gourmet, but this pick was ALL ABOUT NOSTALGIA, FRIENDS, especially when you order the Baker's Choice with pepperoni, mushrooms, sweet peppers, sausage, onion, garlic, and even more cheese below that sauce swirl, then act like a true Delawarean (?) and go down to the beach and eat it. FLORIDASteve's Pizza (address and info) Miami Miami's got more than a few good pizzerias, and the popularity of the NY-style slice there is undeniable. That being said, if you so much as suggest that Lucali is their best pizzeria, they'll pelt you with oranges or whatever. Besides, Steve's is the local favorite for home-grown thin-crust pies, and it's open until midnight every night, so hard-partying types can get their fix, too.Credit: Antico/Jennifer BuiGEORGIAAntico Pizza Napoletana (address and info) Atlanta Antico just turned 5, but with respect to newer spots, like Fritti, the first spot to bring Neapolitan style to Georgia gets our nod, as it continues to churn out crisp, thin pies that take a perfectly timed two-minute stint in the oven and consistently keep lines out the door. HAWAIIInferno's Wood Fire Pizza (address and info) Honolulu, Waikiki Though local legends like Boston Pizza and JJ Dolan's were in the running, we had to go with the newer kid on the block, Inferno's, which spits out thin, Neapolitan pizzas from an 800-degree Kiawe wood-fired oven that they call "The Beast". Get the Guava Smoked Pork with fresh mozzarella, Maui onions, local Kilauea BBQ sauce, and their Shinsato pork. It's very for real. IDAHOFlying Pie (address and info) Multiple locations Sometimes, the best pizza is just an old-fashioned, hand-tossed pie. Flying Pie does just that, with a salty, garlicky dough topped with bicep-straining toppings. Unless you're from New York or named Corleone, this is what you think of when you think of good pizza. ILLINOISVito and Nick's Pizzeria (address and info) Chicago This pick might be a bit controversial, what with Chicago's myriad of awesome deep-dishes... and "stuffed" pizzas, which are basically the same thing but even more like casseroles. However, well-behaved pizza writers seldom make history. So, after some intense debate, we decided to go with (GASP) a thin-crust joint. Vito and Nick's crunchy-edged game is incredibly strong, they've been doing it since 1932, and their square-cut slices contain hidden treasures that even the deep-dish guys could learn a thing or two from.Head over to Thrillist.com for the full story and see if your favorite pizzeria in your state made it on the list!More from Thrillist:The 33 Best Burgers In the CountryTesting The Secret Menus At 8 Chains, From Chipotle To Shake ShackFollow Thrillist on Twitter: www.twitter.com/Thrillist
http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/yahoo-sports-fantasy-minute/heading-to-the-fantasy-football-playoffs---here-are-some-steals-from-down-the-depth-charts-220241980.html	Heading to the fantasy football playoffs? Here are some steals from down the depth charts!	With the fantasy postseason around the corner, it's time for owners to start thinking about getting their rosters in playoff shape. With that in mind, we turn your attention to two backup running backs that need to be rostered in advance of the holiday season. In Kansas City, Jamaal Charles backup Knile Davis has already proven to be a more than capable replacement should injury befall Charles, as he averaged over 20 fantasy points in two games against the tough run defenses of Denver and Miami in Weeks 2-3 when Charles was sidelined with an ankle ailment. Kansas City is the most productive fantasy backfield this season, and Davis would be an RB1 level fantasy option if the injury bug hit Charles again down the stretch. At the very least, Charles' owners should buy the insurance on Davis, who is still available in more than half of Yahoo leagues. The Dallas backfield, thanks to the talents of DeMarco Murray but also because of one of the best run blocking offensive lines in the NFL, is also among the most lucrative in fantasy. Murray currently rates as the highest scoring RB in fantasy this season, but he's also well ahead of the running back field in workload, averaging 28 touches per game. That's at least a bit concerning when you consider that Murray entered the season having averaged 3.7 DNPs per season. For Murray owners, the right move is to make sure backup running back Joseph Randle, who scored on a 40-yard TD run in Week 10, is also sitting in a backup position to Murray on fantasy rosters. Dallas has one of the easiest schedules for running backs over the rest of the season. If Murray's workload is diminished in any way, Randle would immediately become a hot fantasy commodity. He's a lottery ticket (owned in 4 percent of Yahoo leagues) that has the potential for a huge playoff payoff.
http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/572171/20141110/batman-superman-dawn-justice-jena-malone-role.htm	‘Batman V Superman’: Leaked Set Photo Reveals New Character, Hints Jena Malone’s Role—Report	The cast and crew of "Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice" recently headed to Chicago to continue filming. While in the Windy City, a photo leaked online revealed another character has been added to the existing cast.While filming continues in Chicago, someone managed to take a photo of what appears to be a cast member's trailer parked at the production base. The photo was posted online by Movieweb courtesy of Twitter user Filming in Chicago. The image was captioned "All is quiet at base camp." What's intriguing about the photo, according to Movieweb, is the name posted on the trailer door that says "Kahina Double." In the DC Comics, Kahina is believed to be a seer since she is gifted with the ability to see the future. She is reportedly also a member of the group called The Others. This group is said to be hunters of the Aquaman villain called Black Manta.Kahina's involvement in "Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice" has yet to be announced. However, according to the site, actress Jena Malone could be playing the character. She was reportedly recently added to the cast with an unconfirmed role. It's supposedly possible that she has landed the role of the seer. Likewise, the character's presence in the movie reportedly also opens up questions about Aquaman's involvement in "BVS." However, it's still uncertain how Kahina's presence could be linked to the aquatic superhero's story in the sequel.Jena Malone was previously also rumoured to be playing the female Robin character, Carrie Kelly. According to Screenrant, the actress was first reported to have a role in the film when she was spotted on set with director Zack Snyder. Then Jena herself hinted her character in the movie when she posted a somewhat cryptic photo on Instagram. According to the site, she hinted that she could be playing female Robin with her selfie where she's seen sporting bright red hair. Screenrant posted the photo, which was captioned, "Drastic times call for drastic measures."However, Jena Malone's involvement in "Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice" has yet to be officially announced. Whether she is playing the role of Kahina or as the female Robin remains unclear.          
http://news.yahoo.com/nine-rookie-port-authority-cops-fired-wild-jersey-233354133.html	Nine rookie Port Authority cops fired after wild New Jersey graduation bash	NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nine rookie officers from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey police department are being fired and three supervisors disciplined after a rowdy graduation party at a New Jersey bar, authorities said on Friday.The raucous behavior during the Aug. 23 bash at a Hoboken bar raised such concern that the Port Authority is reevaluating its candidate-screening process, the agency said in a statement.After a months-long investigation into the recruiting class's celebration, nine probationary police officers were set to be terminated and three other probationary police officers suspended for 30 days without pay, with their probationary status extended for an additional year, the agency said.Disciplinary proceedings will begin for three staff members from the Port Authority Police Academy who attended the out-of-control celebration as well as two additional officers not on the academy staff. Three of those five officers are supervisors, the statement said."This is a sad day for the Port Authority Police Department," Pat Foye, executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which oversees the region's bridges, tunnels, airports and seaports, said in the statement.The police force, which was founded in 1928 and today has 1,700 members, is responsible for protecting all Port Authority facilities and enforcing state and city laws at the sites, according to the agency website."We are extremely disappointed by the conduct of the probationary officers involved and appalled by the poor judgment of the Academy staff members in attendance," Foye said in the statement. "The conduct in question (is) deeply troubling."The department's investigation involved, among other things, interviews with 100 police officers and a review of social media communications and relevant videotapes, the Port Authority said.(Reporting by Barbara Goldberg; Editing by Eric Beech)
http://www.space.com/28128-mars-orbiter-spies-alien-ice-spiders.html	Mars Orbiter Spies Alien Ice 'Spiders'	The Martian surface is covered with a diverse array of landscapes and features, but this is one of the weirdest.Imaged by the High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on board NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) that orbits the planet 150 miles overhead, strange spider-like formations cover this south polar region of Mars. And these are truly alien features that are found nowhere on Earth.PHOTOS: The Psychedelic Landscape of MarsSo what are they? Is Mars infested with arachnids? Or is it some sort of giant mold? Sadly, it's neither, it's actually a fascinating season-driven phenomena that HiRISE scientists call "araneiform" terrain.Araneiform means, perhaps unsurprisingly, "spider-like" and the term applies to other features that have a "spider", "caterpillar" or "starburst"-like shape, according to planetary scientist Candice Hansen who described the same south pole region in an earlier HiRISE image release.The Martian climate is so cold that even carbon dioxide will freeze from the atmosphere and accumulate as ice on the surface during winter. During spring, the carbon dioxide will sublimate back into the atmosphere as it is heated by a strengthening sun.ANALYSIS: Weird Geological Features Spied on MarsCarbon dioxide ice on Mars does not melt into a liquid state; it bypasses the liquid phase and sublimates straight from a solid into a vapor. This seasonal process therefore creates its own type of erosion on the Martian landscape."This particular example shows eroded channels filled with bright ice, in contrast to the muted red of the underlying ground," writes Hansen. "In the summer the ice will disappear into the atmosphere, and we will see just the channels of ghostly spiders carved in the surface." [Amazing Mars Photos by MRO]Earth's atmospheric temperature does not drop as low as Mars', so carbon dioxide ice (or "dry ice") does not form naturally. Therefore, there is no terrestrial analog of these alien spider channels — it is purely a Mars phenomenon.ANALYSIS: On Mars, Dry Ice 'Smoke' Carves Up Sand Dunes"This is truly Martian terrain — this type of erosion does not take place anywhere naturally on earth because our climate is too warm," adds Hansen.Planetary scientists are therefore very interested in understanding these kinds of erosional processes; they provide us with a very privileged view into the changing seasons on the Red Planet and how very different erosional processes on an alien world continue to shape the dynamic Martian terrain.Special thanks to @HiRISEThis story was provided by Discovery News.

Kids ‘In The Dark’ About Where Mommy Is Going	Joe and Teresa Giudice will split up on Monday, but will the Real Housewives of New Jersey stars say goodbye at the gates of federal prison, or will Joe let someone else drive his wife to jail and stay at home with their four daughters?It’s likely Joe will have to call Uber on Monday – his license was recently suspended, leaving him with no way to drive Teresa to prison unless he wants to get arrested again. With only the two oldest Giuduce girls, Gia, 13, and Gabriella, 10, aware that their mother is getting locked up for breaking the law, a family road trip probably would not have happened anyway.According to Radar Online, Teresa’s two youngest daughters, Milania, 8, and Audriana, 4, are in the dark about their mother’s prison sentence. Apparently, they think the RHONJ star is heading to prison to “work on a book about jail.”Why would Milania and Audriana believe that their mother would leave home for more than a year to write a book about prison? She didn’t spend 15 months in a restaurant when she wrote her cookbooks.“Teresa and Joe feel that they are too young to fully comprehend what is going on…[they] are telling the girls that she is going away to work.”Perhaps Teresa really will write about her prison experiences — she will have more than a year to do so and it could be a way for her to make some extra cash to pay off the mountain of debt that won’t go away on its own.Prison life won’t be anything like the posh life the reality star has been living, and her hair extensions will be a thing of the past, at least for the 15 months she is locked up. Giudice’s former crisis consultant, Wendy Feldman, tells the Mail Online that Teresa is “in denial” about her prison stay, and that a recent photo that shows her enjoying a rather “lavish” vacation with friends is a sign of the RHONJ star’s “self-destructive” side.“Trust me, when she lies down on the top bunk of a metal bed at night and think ‘I can’t leave’, it will take a while to sink in… If she continues to be in denial, she won’t even know she’s there, but she could actually be one of those who does hard time — she could make herself miserable the entire time.”NJ.com reports that Teresa Giudice is scheduled to report to the Danbury Federal Correctional Institute on January 5 to do time for for bankruptcy, mail and wire fraud, and falsified loan applications. However, according to a previous report from the Inquisitr, the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) recently posted Teresa’s inmate information online, and will not confirm that she is actually going to FCI Danbury until Monday.Once Teresa is released at some point in 2016, Joe will begin serving a 41-month sentence for his part in the fraud case — where he will be incarcerated is still unknown.Do you think Joe will go with Teresa twhen she turns herself into prison on Monday, or will he wave goodbye from their Montville, New Jersey, mansion and begin his job as Mr. Mom to the couple’s four daughters?[Image: Bravo]
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/10/17/pentagon-readying-for-long-war-in-iraq-syria/20980227/	Pentagon readying for long war in Iraq, Syria	WASHINGTON (AP) - Ten weeks into its war against Islamic State extremists, the Pentagon is settling in for the long haul, short on big early successes but still banking on enlisting Syrians and Iraqis to fight the ground war so that U.S. troops won't have to.The U.S. general overseeing the campaign on Friday predicted that the jihadists will be "much degraded" by airstrikes a year from now, in part because he is focusing attacks on those resources that enable IS to sustain itself and resupply its fighters.On Friday, for example, the U.S. military said one of its six airstrikes overnight in Syria hit several IS petroleum storage tanks and a pumping station - sites that are central to the militants' ability to resupply their forces and generate revenue. Likewise, it said two coalition airstrikes in Iraq damaged or destroyed IS military targets near the contested town of Beiji, home of Iraq's largest oil refinery.In his first public overview of the campaign he leads from the Florida headquarters of U.S. Central Command, Army Gen. Lloyd Austin cautioned against expecting quick progress. He said he cannot predict how long it will take to right a wobbly Iraqi army and build a viable opposition ground force in Syria."The campaign to destroy ISIL will take time, and there will be occasional setbacks along the way," Austin told a Pentagon news conference, "particularly in these early stages of the campaign as we coach and mentor a force (in Iraq) that is actively working to regenerate capability after years of neglect and poor leadership."While hammering the jihadists daily from the air, the U.S. military is talking of a years-long effort - one that will require more than aerial bombardment, will show results only gradually and may eventually call for a more aggressive use of U.S. military advisers in Iraq."This isn't going to get solved through 18 airstrikes around a particular town in a particular place in Syria. It's going to take a long time," the Pentagon press secretary, Rear Adm. John Kirby, said Thursday, referring to a recent concentration of American airstrikes on the Syrian city of Kobani, near the Turkish border.That is one reason why the Pentagon is preparing to set up a more formally organized command structure, known in military parlance as a joint task force, to lead and coordinate the campaign from a forward headquarters, perhaps in Kuwait. On Wednesday it formally named the campaign "Operation Inherent Resolve."As of Thursday the U.S. had launched nearly 300 airstrikes in Iraq and nearly 200 in Syria, and allies had tallied fewer than 100, according to Central Command. Those figures don't capture the full scope of the effort because many airstrikes launch multiple bombs on multiple targets. Central Command said that as of Wednesday, U.S. and partner-nation air forces had dropped nearly 1,400 munitions.Officials say the strikes have squeezed IS and slowed its battlefield momentum. More specifically, they claim they have destroyed an array of Islamic State military targets: command posts, sniper positions, artillery guns, armed trucks, tanks, mortar positions, buildings, mobile oil refineries and more. The Pentagon has shied from providing a body count, but Kirby said several hundred IS fighters have been killed in Kobani alone in recent days.Yet the militants are making gains in some parts of Iraq, particular in Sunni-dominated Anbar province, even as they stall or retrench in other areas. At times they have appeared within reach of taking control of Syria's Kobani. Baghdad is not believed to be in imminent danger of falling but it is "certainly in their sights," Kirby said.Some U.S. analysts call Obama's approach overly cautious, given the comparatively small number of airstrikes launched thus far and the president's refusal to involve U.S. soldiers more directly in the ground war.Calling it an "unserious air war," analysts Mark Gunzinger and John Stillion of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments wrote this week on the center's website, "In the end, no matter the reason, the timorous use of air power against Islamic State fighters in Iraq and Syria is unlikely to reduce the territory under their control, curb the brutal murder of innocent civilians or prevent the creation of a sanctuary for an enemy that has sworn to continue its fight on a more global scale."Others take a more approving view."The air war is really degrading their infrastructure," said Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, who just returned from a trip that included a briefing at the U.S. air operation center at al-Udeid air base in Qatar."At some point in the next several months, they are not going to have tanks, they are not going have (U.S.-made mine-resistant vehicles), they are not going have the stuff that they stole from the Iraqis. They are going to have AK-47s," he said, and at that point Iraqi and U.S.-trained Syrian opposition fighters can make inroads.

Check the timeiPhoneAndroidBoth Android and the iPhone show you the time when you press the lock button. But many Android phones do time keeping better. Motorola, Samsung and HTC have smart covers and sensors that automatically show you the time when you pull the phone out of your pocket. Android also has a super-dim “daydream” clock that stays on when charging on your nightstand.iPhoneAndroidThe iPhone’s active notifications let you respond from within the notification without opening the app – something Android lacks. But Android lets you set which notifications are “priority,” automatically sending them to the top of the list (and minimizing less important messages). It’s also easier to clear Android notifications with a single swipe.iPhoneAndroidAndroid uses Gmail as its main mail app, no matter what email service you use. It’s pretty bare-bones if you don’t use Gmail, but Android’s “material design” lets you browse folders or switch accounts from any screen with a quick swipe to the right. Unlike Android, Apple’s mail app automatically recognizes your Exchange settings, but it takes a lot more taps to navigate.iPhoneAndroidSearch is Google’s bread and butter, but Apple’s Spotlight searches more stuff than Google does: email, podcasts, notes, reminders, calendar events, texts and voice memos. Still, Siri’s “proactive search” is limited: it only surfaces contacts, apps, nearby attractions and news. “Google Now” works like a Vulcan mind meld, eerily searching for flight reservations, sports scores, transit routes and news stories before you think of them.iPhoneAndroidThe iPhone has a physical switch. On Android, you have to log into your phone, press the volume button, and tap the bell to set it to vibrate. Some Android apps, however, let you automatically set your phone to vibrate in certain situations – when you arrive at work, for instance.iPhoneAndroidAndroid’s default Messenger app is pretty and perfectly serviceable, but iMessage lets you send free texts and voice messages to other Apple customers – even from your Mac. Google Hangouts lets you combine texts and Google Hangouts messages in a single app, and send them from your computer if you have a Google Voice account. But it still feels like a work in progress.
http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/02/19/sitting-disease-disability-older-adults/5583941/	Don't just sit there! It could be harmful later in life	Sitting too much increases the risk of disability in people over 60, study finds.Sitting too much, sometimes called sitting disease, may increase the risk of disability in people over age 60, a new study suggests.Adults this age spend an average of two-thirds of their waking time being sedentary -- roughly nine hours a day, the research showed.Every additional hour adults over age 60 spend sitting increases by 50% their risk of being disabled for activities of daily living such as bathing, dressing and walking, says the study's lead author Dorothy Dunlop, a professor of medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Too many people "have very low levels of activity," she says.The health problems associated with sitting disease are mounting. Research has linked too much sitting to increased risk of heart failure, type 2 diabetes and death from cancer, heart disease and stroke. It may affect mood and creativity. One study showed that if most people spent fewer than three hours a day sitting, it would add two years to the average life expectancy in this country.STORY: Sitting disease linked to heart failureSTORY: Retirement is a good time to pump up your exerciseMORE: For related stories, go to retirement.usatoday.comDunlop and colleagues reviewed data on more than 2,200 people, age 60 and older, who participated in the government's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.The participants wore accelerometers (motion sensors) during their waking hours for one week during the three-year survey period. This measured the time they spent being sedentary, doing light physical activity such as pushing a grocery cart, doing moderately vigorous physical activity such as brisk walking, or vigorous physical activity such as running.Among the findings out Tuesday in the Journal of Physical Activity and Health:• 6.2% of participants met the government's physical activity guidelines, which advise adults to get at least 2½ hours of moderate-intensity physical activity each week, such as brisk walking, or 1¼ hours of a vigorous-intensity activity, such as jogging or swimming laps, or a combination of the two types.• 3.6% reported having disabilities in activities of daily living (eating, bathing, dressing, walking).• The odds of a person being disabled were almost 50% greater for each hour spent in sedentary behavior, Dunlop says. This was true after researchers controlled for physical activity, obesity, socioeconomic status and other health factors.So if you take two women who are 65 years old who spend the same amount of time doing exercise and have the same health profile, if one was sedentary for 12 hours a day, her chance of being disabled is about 6%, Dunlop says. If another person with exactly the same health profile spent 13 hours a day being sedentary, her chance of being disabled was 9%.This study doesn't not prove cause and effect, she says. It could be that disabled people are more sedentary, but there are good reasons to believe that being sedentary could lead to disability, Dunlop says."Older adults should be as physically active as possible," she says. "We know that moderate physical activity, such as brisk walking, is good for your health, and being sedentary is bad for your health. People should find opportunities to replace some of their sitting time with light activity. It's a low-cost strategy to good health."This study is "further evidence that simply getting off the couch has great health benefits," says Tim Church, a physician and director of preventive medicine research at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge. "The only known prescription for maximizing quality of life as we age is the prescription of physical activity."This research is "heavy hitting" because it is "telling us that being sedentary is debilitating when one is elderly," says James Levine, co-director of Obesity Solutions at Mayo Clinic in Phoenix and Arizona State University. He did some of the first research on sitting disease but was not involved in this study. "This is the first time that has been well illustrated."Levine says if you've been sitting for an hour, you've been sitting too long. He recommends getting up for 10 minutes of every hour.Dunlop offers these suggestions for replacing some sitting time with light activity:• If you are watching TV, get up and walk around the house when a commercial comes on.• When you are working in front of a computer, get up and walk around every hour.• When you go to grocery store or mall, park in a space that is far away.• When you get up to have glass of water or for a meal, walk around the house or office.• Take the stairs instead of the elevator, if you are able.Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1eShKRE

Khloé Kardashian sent Lamar Odom a big message on his 35th birthday. (PacificCoastNews.com)It wasn't exactly a Hallmark greeting card, but Khloé Kardashian definitely sent her soon-to-be ex-husband, Lamar Odom, a message on his birthday.The sidelined basketball player turned 35 on Thursday and the milestone wasn't overlooked by the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star. She took to Instagram to post a not-so-cryptic message to Odom, whom she filed for divorce from nearly a year ago.It was a poem entitled "Closure," which talked about a "wound unmended" between a couple, who had "no said goodbye." It ended with, "For all my life, I'll wonder why."View gallery. (Instagram)Khloé, who has rekindled her romance with French Montana, has several loose ends to tie up with Odom. Their marriage went off the rails last year, during a period in which he was arrested for DUI and was reportedly battling a drug problem. Speaking about the split on her reality show, Khloé described herself as "really angry and confused and irritated at life."Related: 5 Signs Khloé Kardashian and French Montana Are Back OnThe pair has yet to finalize their divorce with numerous reports stating Odom has been dragging his feet."He needs to sign papers and he won't," a source close to the Kardashians told People magazine. "He disappears here and there, and she can't find him. She just wants to move on."And that's probably why she's taken to social media to try to send him messages - and on his birthday, no less.

http://www.aol.com/article/2014/07/15/researchers-discover-recipe-for-preventing-alzheimers/20931461/	Researchers discover 'recipe' for preventing Alzheimer's	According to a new study, preventing Alzheimer's could be as simple as following a 'recipe.'A team of researchers from the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden and the National Institute for Health and Welfare in Finland found that older people who exercise, eat healthy and participate in brain-training activities are less likely to develop memory loss.The researchers presented their findings Sunday at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference, where they told the audience there isn't just one thing people can do to prevent memory loss.However, a combination of those three healthy lifestyle choices seems to do the trick.WTVA reports: "This is the first time we actually have a recipe, that we can say, 'this recipe works.' You can try to follow this and you should be able to see some results." ​NBC reports that the study looked at 1,260 volunteers between the ages of 60 and 77. Researchers gave the participants a memory test once at the beginning of the study and again two years later.They discovered that those who exercised, changed their diet, made an effort to socialize and participated in memory training did significantly better on that second memory test than those who didn't.Time quotes one of the study's lead researchers in saying: "These findings show that prevention is possible, and that it may be good to start early. With so many negative trials for Alzheimer's drugs reported lately, it's good that we may have something that everyone can do now to lower their risk."Exactly how this healthy recipe prevents memory loss is still unclear, but of course eating healthily and exercising are often designated as choices with good outcomes.The director of science initiatives for the Alzheimer's Association told HealthDay that it might be because people who participate in more mentally stimulating activities have a bigger "cognitive reserve" in their brains to lean on once brain changes related to Alzheimer's set in.Previous research has shown that exercise in midlife appears to be effective at preventing against dementia later on, as can maintaining a healthy diet.Though as a writer for Forbes points out, there are still some big questions here that need answering, like what are the long-term results of this recipe -- and will it work as well, for example, in the U.S. as it did in Sweden?The study's authors say they will continue to follow the participants for seven years to find the answers.

"There weren't so many barricades then, and you could see the whole tree. Tonight, we'll see only half the tree."She went at the last-minute urging of her "significant other," Joseph Matkovich, 74."This is a gift to us," he said, gazing at the 13-ton spruce.The ceremony came just hours after a grand jury decided not to indict a police officer in a man's videotaped chokehold death. Mayor Bill de Blasio canceled his scheduled appearance to meet with elected officials and activists on Staten Island as citywide protests started to gather steam.Police presence was heavy as hundreds of protesters stood behind rows of police barricades and jammed the sidewalks on Fifth Avenue within sight of the holiday revelers.But the annual tradition went on as planned.The tree's former home was outside a century-old farmhouse in Danville, Pennsylvania."It's really cool to be here. It's such a beautiful night, and there's so many people here - the air is just alive - and I look at my magical tree," said swimming coach Rachel Drosdick-Sigafoos, 29, who donated the spruce with her husband, Dan Sigafoos, 39, a lab technician.

http://news.yahoo.com/mom-fetal-death-concealment-case-due-court-105321124.html	Prosecutors say dead babies were found clothed	UXBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) — They were hidden away in closets just a few feet from where their siblings slept: the skeletal remains of three infants found in a squalid, vermin-infested house.On Tuesday, a judge ordered a Massachusetts woman held on $1 million cash bail after prosecutors said at least two of the babies may have been alive for "some period of time" before they were discovered. Prosecutors had asked for $5 million bail and said Erika Murray could face more serious charges in a case that has repulsed residents of the small town of Blackstone.Murray, 31, a resident of the town, had been held without bail since her arraignment last month on charges of fetal death concealment, witness intimidation and permitting substantial injury to a child.The state Department of Children and Families removed four children ranging in age from 5 months to 13 years from Murray's home in August after her 10-year-old son asked a neighbor for help in quieting a crying baby. The neighbor found the youngest child — the 5-month-old girl — and a 3-year-old girl both covered in their own feces, in separate bedrooms.Friends and neighbors have said Murray appeared to hide the existence of the two youngest children. A prosecutor said in court Tuesday that the two children had never been outside.After interviewing the 10-year-old and 13-year-old, police got a search warrant and went back to the house, where they found the skeletal remains of one baby with a full head of hair in a backpack in the closet of an upstairs bedroom.After discovering those remains, police obtained another search warrant. During the second search, they found the remains of two other babies in another bedroom, also inside a closet. The two oldest children slept in the bedrooms.Both bodies were found wearing diapers and one-piece infant outfits, Assistant District Attorney John Bradley said during a bail hearing for Murray in Uxbridge District Court.Bradley said prosecutors still don't know how the babies died or their ages and are awaiting findings from the state medical examiner's office. He said the fact that two of the babies were clothed seems to indicate "at least two of the babies were alive for some period of time" before they died.View gallery Ramon Rivera III, boyfriend of Erika Murray, stands in Uxbridge District Court in Uxbridge, Mass. Tu …Bradley said the charges against Murray could be upgraded, depending on the medical examiner's findings.Raymond Rivera III, identified in court as her live-in boyfriend, has not been charged in connection with the remains found inside the house. A friend of Rivera's told The Boston Globe last month that Rivera was in "complete shock" when he learned he was the father of the two younger children.Bradley said Murray's 13-year-old daughter and 10-year-old son told police that Murray instructed them to lie to their father, Rivera, and say Murray was babysitting for the two younger children.He faces drug charges for allegedly growing marijuana in the basement, and appeared briefly in Uxbridge District Court on Tuesday. A judge told Rivera he needs to hire an attorney. Rivera quickly left the courthouse while reporters were questioning Murray's lawyer.Bradley said Murray told police that Rivera was the father of all four of her children. Bradley did not address whether she said Rivera, who is also known as Ramon Rivera III in some public records, had also fathered the three infants whose remains were found in the closets.Murray's attorney, Keith Halpern, said the fact the babies were clothed is not by itself proof that the infants were alive for a significant amount of time. He suggested the babies may have been stillborn or could have had some kind of medical emergencies.Halpern said he believes investigators are still in the process of "putting together the pieces of what happened in that house.""There are parts of this story that make absolutely no sense," Halpern said.Bradley said a pediatrician who later examined the 5-month-old and 3-year-old girls found they had been "profoundly neglected" and "severely malnourished." The 3-year-old could not walk and could not feed herself. Neither child had ever been outside, Bradley said.Murray initially told police she had the children at a local hospital, but later said she had given birth to them in the bathroom of her home.Murray's lawyer, Halpern, said it "makes no sense" that Rivera could have lived in the house and not realized there were two younger children there. But he also said it doesn't make sense that Rivera knew about the children and did nothing about the alleged neglect.Halpern has said he believes Murray is suffering from a mental illness. He would not elaborate when asked about that Tuesday.Halpern said previously that he believes Murray secretly gave birth to the two younger children because her boyfriend didn't want any more kids.Murray was brought to the courthouse from jail, but waived her right to appear in court and was not present for the bail hearing.

The reality star, who’s been married to crystal king Spencer Pratt for five years, recently dished our what marriage advice she’d give newlywed Lauren.Related: How to Get Though Your First Year of Marriage“I would just say, ‘Love is really selfless,’” Heidi told Celebuzz at a recent Life & Style event. “It’s really important to be selfless and not always have to be right. You should really think about the other person.”She continues:“It’s about prioritizing the other person,” she said. “I think love is just the key and prioritizing that in your life. Spencer and I have sacrificed a lot to be together so I think we definitely prioritize each other. That’s the secret!”While it seemed that Heidi may have been missing a few marbles on The Hills, she does have sweet marriage advice for the fashion designer. (Unless she’s hinting that her sacrifices include giving up Lauren as a best friend to be with her husband, and in that case, that’s a different blog post for a different day.)Related: After the Wedding — Newlywed To-Do ListHeidi also spread the love when Lauren got married on September 13 and tweeted, “Congratulation @LaurenConrad on finding true love and your soul mate! Sending you love and blessings! The best is yet to come! Love you.”Lauren hasn’t commented back yet (and something tells me she probably won’t) but if she did, I’d imagine she’d say something like:More from The Nest: 7 Relationship Mistakes Even the Smartest Couples Make 5 Fun Trips to Take With Couple Friends Real Couple Sex Diaries Revealed 9 Reasons to Heat Up Your Sex Life
http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/04/08/high-tech-home-improvement-kitchens/2043807/	A thinking refrigerator? Smart kitchens are coming	A look at smart appliances and how they can be integrated in a high-tech home.For years, appliances toiled without companionship, just disconnected boxes hidden away in kitchens and basements. That's all about to change. The next appliance to go in your kitchen still won't get out of the house much, but it will at least talk to the outside world.Manufacturers are already building "smart" home appliances that can interact with their owners and with each other, connect to smartphones, call a repairman when something is wrong, and even negotiate rates with the power company.THE STATE OF THE MARKETPLACEA few Samsung refrigerators, like the RF4289HARS, have built-in touch-screens that can keep track of the food in your fridge, and find recipes to match that inventory. And like tablets or smartphones, these fridges can also run apps and hook up to social-media networks.Many of LG's recent appliances include a feature called Smart Diagnosis, which can streamline the process of repairing an appliance. If something happens, owners can find out what's wrong by calling LG customer service and holding the phone up to a tiny speaker that plays an audible diagnostic code. If the problem is minor, like a clogged vent or water filter, owners will get instructions on how to fix it on their own. If something has really gone wrong, the repair team will already know what needs to be fixed when they arrive.In the laundry room, GE washing machines with CleanSpeak can pass information to their companion dryers about how much moisture is left in the clothes, and how long the drying cycle should last.SMART APPLIANCES: Your home, connectedHIGH-TECH: What is a smart appliance, anyway?While manufacturers are working hard to make the kitchen of the future happen as soon as possible, there just isn't much consumer demand yet. Smart appliance sales totaled a modest $613 million in 2012, according to Pike Research. That's a fraction of the worldwide bottom line.The flashiest models are prohibitively expensive. The Samsung RF4289HARS touch-screen fridge costs $3,699 (and based on our lab tests, the performance doesn't match the price).With more affordable and practical smart appliances, buyers might not even be aware that they're getting a connected device. Those products don't do much to raise the profile of new smart technology."I don't think that we have customers coming in and asking for smart appliances," says Bob Baird, vice president of merchandising for The Home Depot. But he's convinced that consumers will inevitably adopt them. "It's going to happen," he says.WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDSPut simply, for smart appliances to succeed, they need to save time and money for their owners. A handful of smart technologies — some already here, some on the way soon — could fit the bill.The path of least resistance for smart appliances to find their way into homes is through self-diagnostics, like what the LG Smart Diagnosis machines offer. It's just a smarter, more efficient way to deal with repairs.The evolution of the smart grid might also drive smart appliances into homes. The smart grid allows for two-way communication between consumers and utility providers about usage and pricing. Appliances can help save energy by shutting off specific functions during peak energy hours, or delaying cycles until the rates drop in price (usually at night). It won't radically reduce consumption, but it'll be enough to save each household a few bucks' worth of energy each month.Another road to widespread smart-appliance adoption is the possibility of greater user control. Most experts agree that devices such as tablets and smartphones will increasingly serve as a remote control for the home."The tablet and the phone … have changed consumers' expectations of how they interact with other devices," said Warwick Stirling, senior director of connectivity and sustainability at Whirlpool. "Ten years ago, people weren't sure why they wanted to be connected. Now, people don't understand why they're not connected; they just assume that they should be. We could see a scenario, more likely within 10 years, where the majority of appliances are connected."RELATED: The business of smart appliancesA LOOK BACK: There were smart appliances in the 1950s?Kurt Jovais, vice president of marketing for home appliances at Samsung Electronics America, suggested that today's smart appliances are just one of many steps toward a more integrated household. The way Jovais sees it, one-way interaction between user and device will transition into a multidirectional interaction between the user and several different nodes — be they appliances, other devices or public utilities.When all devices, and not just appliances, can communicate freely, we may eventually see a single user interface that can manage an entire home. The ultimate smart appliance app would scan receipts to automatically keep an inventory of the food in an owner's fridge and pantry. It could use that information to whip up recipes, keep track of expiration dates and pass a grocery list to a smartphone — or even order it directly from a delivery service. A product like this is still quite a few years from becoming a reality, but rough prototypes (such as the Haier fridge displayed at IFA 2012 trade show) show some promise.Still, there's widespread skepticism toward smart appliances from consumers and industry players alike. Even some manufacturers were quite frank in expressing their dislike for appliances with tablet-like touch-screens."We don't think it makes any sense to take a tablet, which has an innate benefit to being mobile, and glue it to the front of a fridge," says Whirlpool's Stirling.A LOOK AHEAD: In the future your appliances will talk to one anotherGUIDE: How to buy a smart appliance right nowAdditionally, there's the problem of "future-proofing" a device that can't be replaced with the same frequency as phones and computers. Large appliances last about 14 years on average; for perspective, a fridge that's due for a replacement today has, on average, been sitting in its owner's kitchen since Windows 98 was the most popular operating system.Ultimately, the kitchen of future will be connected and integrated in a way that makes the lives of its inhabitants easier. Smart-appliance technology is progressing rapidly, but it'd be smart to wait a few years and see what develops before you try to build a smart kitchen today.BUYING TIPSIf you decide to shop for a smart appliance, you'll run into a handful of seemingly advanced features and options — some worth considering, some not so much. Here's what to look out for:1. Diagnostics — Many appliances can self-diagnose broken parts. But only a few of them can let their owners know what's wrong through a smartphone app. If it's a serious malfunction, the app can even call customer service and schedule a repair. This is a useful feature, and is even available on some affordable models.2. Food management — A few high-end fridges can keep track of their contents, and send reminders about expiration dates. But they're labor-intensive, and don't make life much easier. In time, the process will be more automated, but the tech isn't good enough yet.3. Customizable cycles — Smart washers and dryers let users download settings for additional, specialized laundry cycles. A clever idea, maybe, but doesn't everybody just set it to "Normal" anyway?4. Smart grid — If and when the infrastructure catches up, most new appliances will be compatible with the smart grid. It should help save consumers a few dollars on each utility bill.5. Touch-screens — Anything "smart" is supposed to have a touch-screen these days, apparently. But on the appliances we've seen with them so far, they feel like unnecessary, tacked-on gadgetry.For more product reviews and news, visit Reviewed.com, a division of USA TODAY, and follow @ReviewedDotCom on Twitter.Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/10ATq2T
http://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/advice/a5973/wedding-things-that-make-no-sense/	16 Things That Make Absolutely No Sense About Weddings	Share Tweet Pin1. Everything you have to spend money on for a wedding is a million times more expensive than it should be. For instance, you might be shocked to discover that flooring your tent for a 120-person affair so that your guests don't have to walk on grass in their high heels costs $10,000.2. Weddings make a lot of family members crazy. There's always a sister or mom or step-mom or random relative who should not have a say who is not happy about some insignificant aspect of the wedding — like that she didn't get to invite the woman who lives four houses down from her or her cousin So-and-So who she never sees or speaks to. Never mind that this is a celebration of the official beginning of your new life with another person! Let's just all bicker for no good reason. Good plan. (No, bad plan.)3. There are so many wedding television shows but 94 percent of wedding planning is really boring and actually, like, not worth a whole show. Where's Extreme Contract Wars: WEDDING VENDORS EDITION?4. You get charged by some bridal gown stores if you don't show up to your dress appointment or cancel within 24 hours. Even if you found a dress three hours before your appointment and have no interest in going to your next one, you end up going because they'll charge you $50 for not showing up. So you end up wasting their time and have to once more suffer the indignity of standing there naked in front of another stranger. (Btw, there is no Champagne at this shit, despite myths perpetuated by movies and TV shows.)5. It takes six months to a year (or more!) to plan a wedding that lasts only a few hours. There is no need to spend this long planning a wedding, but the wedding industry is ~*ObSeSseD~* with making you think that, if you don't book ~*EvErYoNe~* as soon as you have a ring on your finger, you will not have a wedding. I'm sorry but it's LIES!6. You have to have a dress fitted four times.N ormally you just get one or two fittings for things but no, for your wedding, you have as many fittings as there are hours in your actual wedding.7. Your friends buy you underwear. Well, lingerie which is still just... underwear.8. You have to open said underwear presents in front of other people. Lingerie showers are less weird since they tend to be thrown by friends of your age as part of a bachelorette party, but bridal showers with your mom and aunt and fiancé's grandma get weird REAL fast.9. Or you have to open kitchen items in front of other people and act excited about it. New blenders are the shiz and all, but it's not exciting the way winning Miley Cyrus tickets from a radio DJ is.10. People expect you to sleep separately from your fiancé the night before the wedding. Even though you've spent every night together for years. Because weddings make otherwise sane people crazy enough to believe superstitions.11. Holding a giant engagement parties when you're inviting the same people who are coming to your wedding. And rehearsal dinner. And bridal shower. And bachelorette party. Basically, weddings become a full year of making your loved ones show up for things in your honor and buy you presents each time.12. How expensive veils are. You pay 25 percent the price of your dress to wear a trail a thin little piece of fabric off the back of your head for an hour or two. And why do they cost so much? Because they hand-cut the tulle with scissors and then glued a comb to it?13. You have to handwrite thank-you notes. Even though all of these things are true: everyone hates paper mail; you can no longer handwrite things in a legible fashion; you could type out a much more thorough and thoughtful note on a computer that would have more of your heart and soul in it than a janky badly penned card; you are going to mess up and tear up a bunch of fine envelopes and stationary.14. People complain about having to go to weddings. Weddings are booze + food + dancing + cake, which = FUN!15. Your fiancé claims not to care about the wedding and then INSISTS on having a certain cake. This age-old phenomenon is the origin of the groom's cake, of this I am sure. Then, despite planning an otherwise elegant wedding, you serve your guests a chocolate cake that looks like a football stadium or poker table.16. Weddings are the only day on which people feel compelled to take photos with their significant others like this:Related: The Stages Of Picking Out Your Wedding Dress, By Age The 35 Most Stunning Celebrity Wedding Dresses Of All TimeFollow Amy on Twitter.Photo Credit: HBO
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/10/24/as-many-as-six-students-shot-in-washington-school-shooting/20983730/	2 dead, including gunman, 3 injured in Washington school shooting	Two students are dead and four more are injured after a school shooting in Washington state.Gunman Jaylen Fryberg is dead, police have confirmed. He committed suicide after opening fire inside the cafeteria around 10:45 a.m. at Marysville-Pilchuck High School, according to the Seattle Times.He is believed to be the only suspect in the shooting and used a Beretta .40-caliber handgun, federal law enforcement sources told KIRO.Fryberg, a Native-American Indian, was first named by KIRO. He was named freshman homecoming prince just weeks ago.He also was recently suspended from school for fighting, according to the station. He reportedly had been bullied for being Native American, but issues with a girlfriend appear to have been the main catalyst behind his shooting rampage.The other dead student, a female, has not been identified.A local hospital has received three patients, one of them shot in the head, according to KIRO. A fourth shooting victim is expected to arrive. At least one student was airlifted from the scene, according to Fox 6."I didn't know him personally, it seemed like he had a lot of friends," said a student named Robert who spoke to KIRO. "He did not seem like that type of person."The shell-shocked student did not see the shooting, but still seemed disturbed by the morning's events."It's crazy to think something like this happened at our school," Robert said from inside the school while on lockdown with about 40 other students.The gunman opened fire during Robert's lunchtime, but he was not in the cafeteria because he decided "to walk around" instead.He recalled diving into a classroom and quickly locking the door when the gunfire erupted.Another student, Dwayne Kadell, told the station he was only feet from the gunman when the incident occurred."I heard four [shots] "gak, gak, gak, gak," I thought someone was kicking the door," Kadell told the station. "Then I heard "gak, gak," people started running and screaming it was a gun.""I never been through anything like this in my life," he continued. "It was so scary, I just ran."Tweets from inside the school, unearthed by the Daily Dot, detail the horrors seen by students. EVERYONE GET INSIDE A SAFE PLACE - Miguel Rocha (@Miguel_Rocha34) October 24, 2014 DONT GO TOWARDS THE CAFETERIA - Miguel Rocha (@Miguel_Rocha34) October 24, 2014 I never wanna see that again ever - Miguel Rocha (@Miguel_Rocha34) October 24, 2014 @Ray_Raaaay21 one of the kids in the lunchroom started shooting and everyone booked it - ƙąɬıɛ (@___katiie) October 24, 2014 So glad I didn't get shot... I was like a table away! Thank god 🙏 - Jaime Hernandez (@Baeme_) October 24, 2014 @Q13FOX kid came into the cafeteria and walked over to a table and pulled out the gun and shot 4-6 shots at students sitting down - Austin (@Awstin_joynaaa) October 24, 2014The condition of the injured students is not known, but law enforcement told the paper the gunman died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.Aerial shots showed dozens of students running out of the school with their hands in the air, a few were brought out in handcuffs before being bizarrely released without incident.SWAT officers could be seen running around the parking lot and school grounds with assault rifles drawn as they swept the suburban Seattle property for suspects.Police also scoured the high school's football stadium, outdoor bathrooms and other buildings as if in a war zone while students gathered in the parking lot.Many students told KIRO they were evacuated to a nearby church."You never think it will be your school in a random shooting," senior student Rigo Perez told KIRO. "It was just a normal day and then a shooting happened."
http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2014/12/07/marshawn-lynch-breaks-silence-in-interview-with-former-teammate/?ocid=Yahoo&partner=ya5nbcs	Marshawn Lynch breaks silence, in interview with former teammate	Getty ImagesSeahawks running back Marshawn Lynch doesn’t have anything to say to the media.  Except when the member of the media is a guy who used to play with Marshawn Lynch.Lynch, who has become notorious for exiting the locker room before talking to reporters and who more recently has responded to media questions with “yeah” and “nope” answers, sat down for a truly exclusive on-camera, one-on-one session with former Seahawks fullback Michael Robinson.“I ain’t got nothing to say,” Lynch said in defense of his style.  “I just wanna play football.”Of course, Lynch had plenty to say to Robinson, despite Lynch’s stated approach.  Among the things Lynch said is that he realizes his relationship with the media could keep him out of the Hall of Fame.“You know who votes for that,” Lynch said, via NFL.com.  “They don’t seem to . . . see eye to eye with me, which is cool. And if I’m not, [expletive], I’ll still live.”While Lynch’s handling of the media won’t help him (then again, it ultimately didn’t hurt Warren Sapp), the bigger problem for Lynch is his career production.  Currently, he’s 39th on the all-time rushing list, with 8,345 yards.  That puts him well behind non-Hall of Famers like Jerome Bettis (13,662), Fred Taylor (11,695), Corey Dillon (11,241), Warrick Dunn (10,967), Ricky Watters (10,643), Jamal Lewis (10,607), Thomas Jones (10,591), Tiki Barber (10,449), Eddie George (10,441), Ottis Anderson (10,273), and Ricky Williams (10,009).So Lynch, who’s now 28, needs several more years of high-level production to even be in the conversation for Cantonization.  For a guy who reportedly is musing privately about retirement every year, the biggest impediment to Marshawn Lynch getting into the Hall of Fame ultimately could be Marshawn Lynch.
http://phys.org/news/2014-09-divers-ancient-shipwreck.html	Divers sure of new finds from 'ancient computer' shipwreck	Enlarge The Antikythera Mechanism—is a 2nd-century BC device known as the world's oldest computer—becsause it could track astronomical phenomena and the cycles of the Solar SystemArchaeologists set out Monday to use a revolutionary new deep sea diving suit to explore the ancient shipwreck where one of the most remarkable scientific objects of antiquity was found.The so-called Antikythera Mechanism, a 2nd-century BC device known as the world's oldest computer, was discovered by sponge divers in 1900 off a remote Greek island in the Aegean.The highly complex mechanism of up to 40 bronze cogs and gears was used by the ancient Greeks to track the cycles of the solar system. It took another 1,500 years for an astrological clock of similar sophistication to be made in Europe.Now archaeologists returning to the wreck will be able to use a new diving suit which will allow them to more than double the depth they can dive at, and stay safely at the bottom for longer.Double the diving depthThe Exosuit, built in Canada by Nuytco Research, will permit divers to reach depths of 150 metres (492 feet) and still perform delicate tasks, says archaeologist Theotokis Theodoulou.The suit, which resembles a puffy space suit, "expands our capabilities", Theodoulou told AFP as the team set off for a month-long expedition to Antikythera, which lies between Crete and the Peloponnese."I'll be able to grasp, pluck, clench and dig... for several hours," he said.Archaeologists believe many other artefacts are yet to be discovered in and around the wreck. Up to now they had only been able to operate at a depth of 60 metres.The mechanism was found with a spectacular bronze statue of a youth in the wreck of a cargo ship apparently carrying booty to Rome, and researchers are certain that other items on board still remain to be discovered."We have good signs that there are other objects present," said Angeliki Simosi, head of Greece's directorate of underwater antiquities, after exploratory dives in the area in 2012 and 2013."There are dozens of items left, this was a ship bearing immense riches from Asia Minor," added Dimitris Kourkoumelis, another archaeologist on the team.The archaeologists also hope to confirm the presence of a second ship, some 250 metres away from the original discovery site.Antikythera, which now has a population of only 44, was on one of antiquity's busiest trade routes, and a base for Cilician pirates, some of whom once captured and held the young Julius Caesar for ransom. He later had them all captured and crucified.Monumental statuesThe Greek team is assisted by Brendan Foley, a marine archaeologist from the renowned Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution at Massachusetts, which was involved in a dive to the wreck of the Titanic.Foley has helped in outings to identify ancient shipwrecks over the last five years."We may find one or more monumental statues that were left behind in 1901, in the mistaken belief that they were rocks," Foley said.As well as the new Exosuit, the Antikythera expedition will also use robot mapping equipment and new advanced closed-circuit "rebreathers", which will allow divers much more time underwater."We will have more bottom time than any previous human visitors to the site, because we dive with mixed gas rebreathers," the expedition's website said."Each diver will have more than 30 minutes of bottom time per day, and will enjoy greater mental acuity and a larger safety margin than that of previous divers at Antikythera."Explore further: Researchers to use exosuit to explore ancient Antikythera wreck

http://www.vox.com/2014/11/12/7206975/ultron-trailer	What we learned from Marvel's new Avengers: Age of Ultron trailer	On  Wednesday, Marvel released an "extended" trailer for its upcoming blockbuster, Avengers: Age of Ultron — the second "extended" spot in a month. Though the trailers are largely similar, Marvel is actually giving viewers some good teases, teases you might miss if you blink.Here are the two biggest scenes of the new trailer, and the main differences from its predecessors:The first new scene: Ultron and Iron Man suits attack(Marvel)"You want to protect the world, but you don't want it to change," Ultron tells the Avengers in this sledgehammer of a scene. "There's only one path to peace — your extinction."This scene is perhaps the biggest reveal that Marvel has shown us in the last three trailers. We see Ultron, we see Ultron say some ominous things, and then we see him use Iron Man suits to attack the Avengers. It shows you what he's capable of, and makes you think about the giant mess that he's going to make at the Avengers' tower.What was here before:(Marvel)In the first extended trailer (released on October 28), we see the Avengers joking around and trying to lift up Thor's hammer. And in the midst of this good time, they're interrupted by Ultron, which looks like its part of the same scene above."How could you be worthy? You're all puppets ... tangled in strings," Ultron says in this trailer before it cuts away to him crushing the skull of an Iron Man suit.(Marvel)With the bits from the new trailer, we presumably have the beginning and the end of that scene and some different words that show Ultron's animosity. But we still don't know what the Avengers are celebrating.The second new scene: Iron Man attacks some peopleThe other noticeably new scene has Iron Man (or possibly one of his suits) attack some people in what looks to be snowy Eastern Europe. The people he attacks look to be in uniform, so they are most likely Hydra agents:(Marvel)What was here before:This scene didn't exist in the previous trailer, but it looks to be the continuation of a scene that involves Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo):(Marvel)And Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner):(Marvel)Since this seems like Eastern Europe and it involves Hydra, there's speculation that this scene also involves Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor Johnson), who are trapped/under the watch of Eastern European Hydra agents in the post-credits scene of Captain America: Winter Soldier.With the release of this trailer, that marks three trailers for a movie that comes out on May 1 (or, in other words, five months and 19 days from now).
http://news.yahoo.com/authorities-man-just-freed-prison-kills-mom-064636260.html	Authorities: Man just freed from prison kills mom	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) — Just two days after a convicted murderer had been released from prison, he was arrested and charged in the beating death of his 64-year-old mother, authorities said.Gwendolyn Pratt was found dead around 6:30 a.m. Sunday at a home in Atlantic City, The Press of Atlantic City (http://bit.ly/1saiKL1 ) reported. An autopsy determined that she died from massive blunt injuries to the head, Atlantic County prosecutor Jim McClain said in a statement.Her 45-year-old son, Steven Pratt, was detained at the scene and charged with murder. He was being held on $1 million bail, and it was not known if he has retained an attorney.A neighbor of the victim told the newspaper that Pratt's family threw him a large welcome-home party after he was released from prison. The neighbor, Ruan Tilghman-Pugh, said Pratt had asked a cousin whether he could stay with him after having a disagreement with an aunt with whom he was staying over the weekend."He said: 'Cuz, I need to live with you. Aunt CeCe, she be on me,'" Tilghman-Pugh told the paper."It's so devastating," Tilghman-Pugh said. "You just never know what people are going through."Pratt was 15 when he shot and killed his next-door neighbor, Michael Anderson, in an Atlantic City apartment building in 1984. He was tried as an adult and convicted of first-degree murder in 1986. He received a 30-year prison sentence and was freed on Friday.According to court records, Pratt and Anderson argued after Pratt and some of his friends refused to leave an apartment hallway where they were noisily hanging out. Pratt came back to Anderson's apartment with a lead pipe, but Anderson took the pipe away from Pratt and bloodied his face, according to the newspaper.Pratt then returned with a borrowed handgun and shot Anderson in the face and shoulder. Anderson, who Pratt said acted like a father to him, died days after the shooting.___Information from: The Press of Atlantic City (N.J.), http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com

Querry doesn't mind the schedule too much, though, especially when she gets to see things like this:Waffle really enjoys her feeding"I love that I get to see it every day!" says Querry, who also shares her home with Petunia the hamster and Rigby the cat. "Whenever I've bottle fed kitties, they wiggle their ears. It never gets old how cute it is."The feeding routine will continue until a couple of weeks from now, when the kittens move on to solid food.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-pope-francis-matters_55d370dee4b07addcb443e0c	Why The Pope Matters	An estimated 1.5 million people are expected to join Pope Francis on September 27 for a celebration of the Mass at the culmination of the World Meeting of Families in Philadelphia. The massive gathering, plus the pope’s participation in the Festival of Families the day before, which is expected to draw close to 750,000 people, has led to the coining of the term “Popeapocalypse”.Universities are closing, pilgrims are staking sleeping plots in the Philadelphia Zoo, the mass transit system is holding a lottery for train tickets and women expecting to give birth in the area are looking at traveling to other cities -- all in anticipation of Pope Francis's visit. There is no other religious, entertainment or political leader alive today who could garner anywhere near the kind of response inspired by the pope -- a fact that leaves some people scratching their heads and wondering: why? Why does the pope matter so much? He's A Transnational Political LeaderAs the head of the Roman Catholic Church, the pope occupies a position that no other religious leader can match. Most major religions do not have a hierarchical structure that clearly acknowledges one leader who embodies the tradition like the pope does for Catholicism. The pope is the head of a cohesive, transnational organization that has been in existence for close to two thousand years. The church has a chain of command from the Vatican all the way to the local parish that is capable of transmitting information, ideology and material goods throughout the world.   Contrast this with other religions that are mostly fragmented among many different sects, and leaders among them. And even among those that do have existing hierarchies, such as the Anglican Communion, the numbers do not compare to the estimated 1.2 billion Roman Catholics. The influence of the Catholic Church is augmented by the status of the Vatican as an independent city-state that maintains diplomatic relations with countries around the world. As the leader of the Vatican, when the pope visits a country, it's not just as a religious leader, it is as a head of state. This sets the pope apart from most leaders, whether religious or political, aside from more ceremonial positions, such as the one held by the Queen of England, who is both titular head of the Anglican Church as well as of the Commonwealth but exerts little influence on either. The pope, on the other hand, is the clear authority behind both of these titles and able to wield influence that comes with it.Not only is the Catholic Church transnational, in many parts of the world it is an influential player in domestic politics and civic life. These domestic churches are led by local bishops, archbishops and cardinals, all of whom are appointed by the pope and who are responsible to him. This means that the kind of priorities and interests of local Catholic Church’s is greatly influenced by kind of people put into the highest places by the pope. He Has International Religous InfluenceAside from political and diplomatic power, the soft inspirational power of the pope is even more impressive. For a large section of humanity, the Catholic Church has for millennia been their conduit to the Divine, and has provided answers to the questions of how to live a moral and meaningful life.As the head of the Roman Catholic Church the pope's authority is linked back to Saint Peter, one of Jesus’s disciples who is considered by the Roman Catholic Church to be the first pope. Papal pronouncements hold serious weight and the pope has great influence on how Catholics understand what is holy -- for instance he plays the central role in the process of declaring saints and shrines. The pope also is the highest representation of the Catholic Church to other faith traditions, whether to other religions, other Christian denominations or the secular world. Not only are papal pronouncements and activities conveyed through Catholic channels, they are also the subject of media interest and are covered closely. When the pope speaks about the Christian Gospel, as he does on Wednesdays and Sundays in St. Peter’s Square, through Encyclicals and in less formal settings, he often relates the religious and spiritual message not only to personal morality and salvation, but also to societal issues and political life. This frequently involves taking positions on controversial debates in countries around the world and within broader world events. Given the immense power of the position it is clear that any pope is going to matter. However, when the role is held by such captivating figure as Pope Francis, the pope matters a lot.From the moment the newly elected pope faced the crowds in St. Peter's Square and his chosen name was announced -- Francis -- the spirit of possibility began to blow through the Roman Catholic Church.Pope Francis's Particular PapacyFrancis has already become one of the most remarkable figures of the 21st century. From the very beginning, when he eschewed the Apostolic Palace for a simple boarding house, traded in the pope’s Mercedes popemobile for a Hyundai, and declared how he wished for a poor church and church for the poor, Francis has made headlines with his -- to some -- surprising words and deeds. Within his first year the new pope observed Maundy Thursday by washing the feet of young inmates, including women and Muslims, said that atheists could be redeemed, opined that the church had been emphasizing gay marriage and abortion too much, accused the bureaucracy of having "spiritual Alzheimer's", stated that global financial markets are “tyrannizing the poor” and, of course, his now iconic response about a gay people: “Who am I to judge?”  He has gone on to use his platform to especially highlight the plight of immigrants, the homeless, the poor, Middle East peace, the persecution of Christians and most recently took on the moral question of the environment his encyclical, "Laudato Si."The pope makes for good headlines but his priorities reverberate within world politics and within societies around the world.  Pope Francis has been credited with helping to broker the rapprochement between the US and Cuba, the country where he will be visiting directly before his arrival in the U.S.  Francis's actions echo the work of John Paul II who was influential in the cracking of the Iron Curtain with his visit to his home country of Poland in 1979, where 2 million people welcomed the first Pope to visit the Communist country. In the United States, Pope Francis's "Who am I to judge" line was referenced by a Catholic State Senator in Illinois who cast the deciding vote in favor of gay marriage in 2013, before the Supreme Court made that it the law of the land. Conversely, Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush was forced to refute Francis’ statement on the environment and economics. "I don’t get economic policy from my bishops or my cardinals or my pope," Bush said.Francis will be the first pope to address the U.S. Congress, which will be sure to pose challenges to political figures on both sides of the aisle. It seems likely that the pope’s visit and his words will be referenced within the presidential primaries and general election.  It has hard to point to another figure who has been as direct about issues such as the environment, economics, and immigration than Pope Francis. He's Helped Reform The Catholic ChurchWithin the Vatican, Francis has been active in trying to reform and  "clean up" the Curia as well as the Vatican Bank, which helps fund the work of the church. His effectiveness in these efforts, as well as the most pressing work on repairing the damage of lives from clergy sexual abuse, have been closely watched. While many are concerned at the slow pace of reform, it appears that, under Francis, the church is setting up appropriate structures and beginning to move in the right direction, most prominently within the bank. As mentioned above, the pope has pretty much absolute power over the hierarchy of the church. Part of his responsibilities are to appoint new Cardinals who will eventually vote for the next pope, as well as appoint and replace bishops and archbishops who provide leadership to Catholics in countries around the world. Francis has used this power to increase the presence and power of the global south by appointing cardinals from some of the poorest regions of the world. He has also shuffled the roles of leading Catholic clergy in the United States and elevated some of the more moderate figures among the Catholic leadership as well as swiftly removing Bishop Tebartz-van Elst (Bishop Bling) in Germany for overly extravagant expenditures. One of the most noticeable transformations under Francis has been in the space of social media. Francis’s predecessor arrived on Twitter with the regrettable handle @Pope2YouVatican, which Jon Stewart mocked on his show. Nobody is making fun now. Under Pope Francis, the Twitter operation has switched into high gear with @Pontifex tweeting in multiple languages (including Latin!) and Francis has been named the most influential tweeter for the last two years.However, it is the pope’s offline presence that really shows how much he really matters.In one-on-one meetings, or in front of three million in Rio, Francis's humble, warm, pastoral spirit has resonated with Catholics and non-Catholics alike. In this world where religious and non-religious alike are hungry for a sense of connection, a desire for the articulation of inequality, and inspiration to work for a more compassionate, peaceful and just world, the Pope's words and deeds matter.  Also on The Huffington Post

Bonnar went off on Ortiz, tossing several disparaging remarks in the former UFC light heavyweight champion’s direction. The announcement devolved into an in-cage scuffle that left most onlookers shaking their heads.SEE ALSO: Tito Ortiz and Stephan Bonnar Scuffle VideoAccording to Tito Ortiz, it was all according to plan. Not that he intended for Bonnar to step in the cage and blast him on a personal level, dragging Ortiz’s family and fans into his trash talk. Ortiz says he did, however, plan to sucker Bonnar into fighting him under the Bellator banner, not in the UFC, as he believes was the original plan.“Well, it really came down to a plan, an idea that I thought would work, worked perfectly,” Ortiz said on a recent edition of Knockout Radio when asked how the fight came together.“When I first signed with Bellator, I guess Dana (White) and Bonnar kind of had an idea that if they called me out, I would come back to the UFC and fight. And this was a year ago that this happened. And I wasn’t going to let that happen.“I wanted to fight in Bellator, so I signed with Bellator and I thought in my mind, ‘How can I get Bonnar to Bellator to finally shut him up and smash him after the things he said?’” he continued.SEE ALSO: Listen to the Full Tito Ortiz Interview Here“And sneakily on my side, I got (fighter manager) Dave Thomas to sign him. Dave Thomas signed him and we had to think of something to make him believe that Dave Thomas doesn’t like me, that Paul Herrera didn’t like me. Paul Herrera was going to coach him. And Stephan Bonnar bit the line, hook and sinker. He thought in his own mind that all of his guys were against me and I fooled him.”Ortiz’s relationship with Herrera goes back a long, long way. Herrera was Ortiz’s high school wrestling coach, and he’s trained with Herrera off and on for years. Ortiz indicates that sending Herrera in to work with Bonnar was his plan all along, that it really had nothing to do with him not wanting to work with Herrera, and that it had everything to do with having an insider in Bonnar’s camp.“And now it’s a week out from the fight. I know how his training camp went. I know the ins and outs. So he just got baited,” Ortiz said. “That’s how bad I want to cave his face in.“I’m the king of trash talk, but at the end of the day, the person who laughs last, laughs loudest and hardest. And that’s me.”Knockout Radio host Randy Harris asked Ortiz outright, “So this was all a setup up by you and not him?”“Come on, how long have I been in this business? Can’t mess with me!” Ortiz declared. “This guy, when he talked trash, with him and Dana talking trash, I was like, ‘How do I get in the cage and fight him and not in the UFC?’ And I just sat back and let the strings be pulled.“I know everything from the wrestling side of it. I know what he can and can’t do through Paul Herrera, who his training partner is. I know how much he’s been working on his takedown defense, what type of striking he’s been doing.”Why would Ortiz do such a thing? Because Bonnar got under his skin, plain and simple.“I don’t like this guy. He’s been talking about my family. He’s been talking about my fans,” Ortiz said. “And for him to talk about them the way he has, I had to come up for a way to get him back and this is the way to do it, and on Nov. 15 I’ll shove my elbow through his face and it’s going to be exciting.”Follow MMAWeekly.com on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

https://www.yahoo.com/parenting/how-mom-dealt-with-stinging-criticism-from-sons-99058065542.html	How Mom Shut Down Teacher's Stinging Criticism	As a former preschool teacher turned stay-at-home-mom, I was selective when it came to choosing a preschool for my two sons.I wanted a classroom that felt like an extension of home. A school that was a community, with warm, caring teachers. The place I chose had an environmentally friendly curriculum I liked. I saw messy, imperfect art on the wall that was child-directed (not teacher instructed.) I watched children play with wooden fire trucks from the 1970’s the teacher had carefully saved, and blueberries being passed out as the snack in correlation to reading Robert McCloskey’s Blueberries for Sal.STORY: How This Pregnant Woman Lives on $20 a DaySo it was to my great surprise two weeks into the school year when I realized I despised my younger son’s teacher. It began quite simply: I was three minutes late, and upon arrival she whisked me aside and said in a strained voice: “He is already crying every morning. Being late only makes his adjustment harder.”Of course I knew she was right, but still, it stung. I felt like a bad mom. The next day, it was different issue: “He needs his sandwich cut in four, not in half. It is too hard for him to hold it otherwise.”Soon, her demands rained over me like a waterfall I was drowning beneath: “Please buy him a proper lunchbox, we don’t tolerate paper bags here.” “Keep quiet in the hallway when you pick up your kids, other children are napping. I noticed you talk loudly sometimes.”STORY: Exposed by My Children for What I Really Look Like"Put away your cell phone."She once whisked my lukewarm coffee cup right out of my hand, chiding me: “We don’t allow coffee in school; you could have burned one of the children.”"But it’s not hot," I muttered pathetically.It went on like this for several weeks. I’d feel my stomach clench every morning while driving, and worsen as we approached the school’s front doors.As a result of my frustration, I found myself snapping at my husband and children. I began calling her “The Dragon” to friends. Ironically, my son, wary of most adults, loved her. Pulling him out of class would mean a great disruption for not only him, but his brother as well.It was time to bring out the big guns. I would kill her with kindness, a tactic I have used in the past to deal with difficult people. Now, instead of getting huffy when she acted demanding, I plastered on a huge grin and said chirpily, “Thank you so much for these suggestions. I really appreciate your advice.” I offered to help her cut out shapes for an art project. I asked if she needed a class mom to help decorate the room, or send weekly updates to the other parents.STORY: Taking Prenatal Iron May Lower Your Child’s Risk of AutismOnly… things didn’t quite turn out the way I wanted. She grew even more pushy, more demanding.It turns out I was going about the whole problem completely wrong."Nice works fine when you’re dealing with nice people," says Dr. Rick Kirschner. Kirschner is the co-author of "Dealing With People You Can’t Stand: How to Bring Out the Best in People at Their Worst."We were “coming from two different styles of interaction,” Dr. Kirschner added. ”Your style is more ‘get along.’ You’re helpful and compliant. She is direct, to the point. She wants things done her way, right away.”So how to handle "The Dragon"?"You need to shift the situation by speaking to [her] the same blunt and quick way she speaks to you," says Dr. Kirschner. "No more ‘dextification,’ which stands for defending, explaining, excusing, and justifying." I also have to stop making myself so available:"When you enter the classroom, try ‘Yes, no, got to go,’" Dr. Kirschner says. Essentially, stop hanging around, stop asking how to help. Stop engaging with her demands. Drop-off should be quick. The hope and intention is that in time she will get the message that I expect the same respect from her that I give myself in her presence. That I’m not a wimp, and I’m self directed."Remember to keep your conversations short and to the point. And if you have difficulty not getting upset, breathe into those feelings, and talk encouragingly to yourself," Dr. Kirschner advises.Deep breaths. I’ll try to remember that at drop-off tomorrow.

http://www.voanews.com/content/activists-us-led-airstrikes-killed-553-syria/2493295.html	Activists: US-led Airstrikes Killed 553 in Syria	Syrian activists said a month of U.S.-led airstrikes in Syria has killed 553 people, mostly militants from the Islamic State group and al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front.The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Thursday the deaths include 464 Islamic State fighters and 32 civilians.The group, which has tracked the violence in Syria throughout the country's civil war, said it believes even more Islamic State militants have actually died but remain unreported because of difficulties in accessing some of the airstrike sites.Also Thursday, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said a deal had been reached to send 200 Iraq Kurdish peshmerga fighters through Turkey to help defend the Syrian border town of Kobani against Islamic State militants.Peshmerga to be deployedA senior official in Iraq's Kurdistan region told Reuters the peshmerga would be equipped with heavier weapons than those being used by Kurdish fighters in Kobani, who say they need armor-piercing weapons to fend off Islamic State fighters.Peshmerga spokesman Halgurd Hikmat told Reuters that preparations to deploy to Kobani were going on, but it would not happen on Thursday.Erdogan spoke after Iraqi Kurdish lawmakers on Wednesday approved sending the fighters. The move marks the semi-autonomous region's first military foray into Syria's war.Late Wednesday, Syrian Kurdish factions signed a deal to share power and set aside rivalries to capitalize on growing international support for their fight against Islamic State militants.The agreement was reached after nine days of talks and coincided with a decision by Iraqi Kurdistan to send its own peshmerga forces to reinforce fellow Kurds in Kobani.Kurds have taken advantage of more than three years of civil war in Syria to carve out their own zone of influence in the north of the country, but have been beset by internal rivalries.Earlier this year, the dominant Democratic Union Party (PYD) established three “cantons” in northern Syria and declared self-rule, but other Kurdish parties rejected the move.Wednesday's deal, which was signed in Iraqi Kurdistan under the auspices of the region's President Masoud Barzani, puts decision-making in the hands of a new body in which all parties will be represented.AirstrikesThe U.S. is continuing its aerial bombardment against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, launching 15 new attacks.The U.S. Central Command said Thursday it carried out nine strikes in Iraq in the last day, with four of them destroying insurgent operations near the Mosul dam and three others attacking militant positions south of Fallujah.Meanwhile, the American military said it hit six targets in Syria, four of them near the restive town of Kobani, where the Islamic State and Kurdish fighters have been battling for weeks for control of the region just south of the Turkish border.Huge plumes of black smoke from the Kobani explosions could be seen from across the border in Turkey.Four air strikes by U.S. and allied forces in Iraq near the vital Mosul Dam hit small Islamic State units and destroyed a vehicle while another attack near Bayji took out a fighting position. Four strikes in the Fallujah area targeted a training facility, a larger Islamic State unit and a building.Islamic State militants, keen to consolidate territorial gains in northern Syria, has pressed an offensive on Kobani even as U.S.-led forces continue bombing the militants' positions.U.S. and partner nation planes have carried out more than 200 airstrikes in Syria since September 22, as part of an expanded effort to halt the Islamic State group.At least 300 coalition airstrikes have also targeted the group in Iraq, where the militants swept through large areas of the northern and western part of the country in recent months.Bundle of weapons goes to ISMeanwhile, the Pentagon said a stray bundle of weapons and ammunitions that U.S. cargo planes intended to airdrop to Kurds in northern Syria did likely end up in the hands of Islamic State fighters.Spokesman Steve Warren said Wednesday that 26 of 28 bundles dropped over Kobani were picked up by Kurds, but that two went astray. Warren said U.S. forces destroyed one, while the other was probably picked up by militants.Video from a pro-Islamic State media group shows a masked fighter inspecting hand grenades, ammunition, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers as he voiced delight.But Warren said the weapons are not enough to give the militants any type of advantage as they battle Kurdish defenders for control of Kobani.On Thursday, the battle for strategic town of Kobani was raging on as gunshots rang out throughout the morning and echoed across to the Turkish side of the border.Refugees in Turkey told VOA that residents in Kobani said there was heavy fighting overnight. The sound of heavy firing of mortars, RPGs (rocket-propelled grenades), possibly heavy machine guns and some lighter weapons also was heard around mid-day.Correspondent Scott Bobb contributed to this report from Turkey. Some material for this report came from Reuters.

Although he can taste, swallow and digest food normally, his body no longer tells him when he's hungry or thirsty.His parents have held off on sharing their story for the sake of his privacy, but now, desperate for answers, they're speaking out, reports CBS News medical contributor Dr. Holly Phillips."It's hard to explain," Landon's father Michael said. "You have a child who's running and playing and laughing and then you wake up one night and our world is flipped upside down."It all began last fall just days after celebrating his 11th birthday. Landon woke up one morning with absolutely no urge to eat or drink. He was dizzy and severely congested.A chest x-ray revealed a bacterial infection in his left lung, and although that eventually went away, Landon's ability to feel hungry or thirsty never returned."You can put food in front of him, he won't touch it," Michael said. "It'll sit there all day and all night."Over the past year, the sixth grader has lost about 40 percent of his body weight, plummeting from 104 pounds to just 67.The Jones' search for answers has taken them to five different cities including Rochester, Minnesota, where pediatric neurologist Marc Patterson examined Landon at the Mayo Clinic."This combination of loss of appetite and loss of thirst is something that I have not encountered before," he said.Patterson believes the problem could lie within the boy's hypothalamus, the pea-sized portion of the brain that regulates hunger, thirst and essential functions like sleep and body temperature."Functions that are normally automatic for all of us have become voluntarily, or need to be voluntary in Landon's case," he said.Because of his condition, Landon's parents have been presented with a unique challenge."The way we're seeing it as parents is that we're being his brain -- telling him to eat, and drink," Michael said. "We're being his hypothalamus."Michael sits with Landon at every meal, encouraging him to eat and drink, his mother Debbie stocks their kitchen with healthy food as well as high calorie and protein snacks, hoping something will help Landon maintain his weight, and his health."Even on the boosts and the weight gainers, he still is continuing to lose weight," Debbie explained.The illness has not only changed Landon's body, but also his personality, transforming him from chatty and energetic to lethargic and withdrawn."It's very frustrating as a mother," Debbie said. "I miss my little boy. I just miss Landon.""We can't just sit back and watch our son deteriorate over time and that's what he's doing, he's deteriorating" Michael added. "I feel like because of his condition his childhood is being robbed. I want him healthy. That's it, I want him healthy."Along with their doctors, the family has reached out to the National Institutes of Health, hoping Landon will be considered for evaluation.The agency has an undiagnosed diseases division that accepts 50-100 cases each year.

He was taken to a hospital, and his stepmother, Araceli Diaz, said Saturday that he was "serious but stable" condition with second- and third-degree burns.Gomez Perez and other indigenous farmers have been protesting last year's jailing of his father, Florentino Gomez Giron. The father is charged with murder, stealing cattle, organized crime and causing 39 families to flee the Ixtapa municipality as a result of leading indigenous protests in 2011 to demand improved basic services. The protests culminated in violence that included the destruction of police cars and the burning of the Ixtapa town hall.The human rights office of the Chiapas state government issued a statement lamenting Gomez Perez's immolation and saying it would seek to discourage "acts that put at risk the lives of protesters."Authorities said the father remains in prison.

This is what made us leave," said Abu Ali, a 45-year-old farmer who fled the violence along with his mother, wife, and two children."It became a military area," he said. "We did not bring anything with us -- we escaped with our lives."Houses and cars were blown up and orchards uprooted, he said."There is nothing left."In Jurf al-Sakhr, dozens upon dozens of once-soaring palm trees have been toppled, laid out in rows in fields along the road, while abandoned goats, cows and other livestock wander loose.View gallery Members of Iraqi pro-government forces celebrate near the town of Jurf al-Sakhr, on October 30, 2014 …Some of the roads winding through the palm trees and farms are navigable, but bombs planted by IS still make other parts impossible to pass.The burned bodies of three militants lie decomposing in the sun next to the smashed remains of a Humvee armoured vehicle near one bomb-laden stretch of road.While security forces were deployed in parts of the expansive district, Shiite militiamen, who in some cases have acquired US-made military equipment, made up the bulk of the forces.An M113 armoured personnel carrier driving down one road had been painted with the name of Shiite militia Asaib Ahl al-Haq, while another flew the group's flag.- Bomb-rigged buildings -View gallery Iraqi special forces search a house in the Jurf al-Sakhr area, north of the Shiite shrine city of Ka …In the town of Jurf al-Sakhr, which shares its name with the surrounding area, shops have been smashed in the fighting, windows shattered, metal roofs scarred by shrapnel.Graffiti, much of it Shiite religious references, covers walls, buildings and even the wall of a mosque.Before they were forced out, the jihadists rigged buildings in the town with bombs that have yet to be defused, militiamen said.A building that may once have been the police station has been reduced to a pile of broken concrete.It is not always clear who is responsible for the destruction, with all the combatants having played a role.But at least some of the fires in the area have been set by militiamen, with one fighter from the Ketaeb Hezbollah militia saying that: "We burned those houses belonging to (IS)."Abu Ahmed, a 55-year-old farmer who fled the area, was critical of the militiamen, who are viewed with suspicion by many Sunnis due to their involvement in sectarian violence in past years."What did (they) liberate? This militia killed us, bombed us, destroyed our houses," Abu Ahmed said.
http://www.voanews.com/content/reu-ebola-drug-trials-to-be-fast-tracked-in-west-africa/2459277.html	CDC: Ebola Could Infect 1.4 M by 2015	Between 550,000 and 1.4 million people in West Africa could be infected with the Ebola virus by January 20, 2015, according to a report issued on Tuesday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The top range of the estimate, 1.4 million, assumes that the number of cases officially cited so far, 5,864 according to the count kept by the World Health Organization, is significantly underreported, and that it is likely that 2.5 times as many cases, or nearly 20,000, have in fact occurred.CDC emphasized that the projections, based on an epidemiological model that takes into account how many people each Ebola patient eventually infects as well as other factors, is based on data available in August. They therefore do not account for the recently announced U.S. government Ebola relief effort, which includes sending 3,000 members of the armed forces to the Ebola-stricken region."Extensive, immediate actions - such as those already started - can bring the epidemic to a tipping point to start a rapid decline in cases," CDC said in a statement.The agency's best-case model projects that by getting 70 percent of patients into facilities where the risk for transmission is reduced and burying the dead safely, the epidemic would be "almost ended" by January 20.Liberia in perilA senior U.N. official warned the escalating Ebola crisis in Liberia is threatening the social fabric of the country, reversing many of the social, economic and political gains achieved since Liberia emerged from civil war. U.N. special representative Antonio Vigilante said Tuesday the number of Ebola cases in Liberia is doubling every few weeks and stands at more than 3,000. About half of those infected have died.  “While in the last [few] years Liberia was growing at a very interesting rate, the projections for this year have already been slashed by half and perhaps now 70 percent," Vigilante said."Production in the mining industry and the agricultural sector and the forestry sector are slowing down, and many in the concessions are actually closed or have had their activities reduced significantly."Vigilante said poverty is increasing as people lose their livelihoods, markets are short of supplies and people are going hungry because food prices are soaring.Experimental drug trials Meanwhile, it was revealed that experimential Ebola drugs will be tested in West Africa for the first time, as part of an initiative to quickly find treatments for the vicious disease.A London-based charity, the Wellcome Trust, said Tuesday it is giving $5.2 million so a consortium of aid groups, research institutions and the World Health Organization can set up clinical trials at Ebola treatment centers.There is currently no cure or vaccine for Ebola, which has infected more than 5,600 people and killed more than 2,800 in West Africa this year, mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.  The Wellcome Trust says drugmakers taking part in the project include Mapp Biopharmaceutical, whose untested Zmapp drug has been given to a small number of Ebola patients, as well as a Canadian company, Tekmira, and U.S.-based Sarepta.Precise details of how the trials will be carried out are still under discussion.  The Wellcome Trust says participating groups are working with health officials in the affected countries to choose the best sites for the trials.WHO says the number of people infected with Ebola could grow at an "explosive" rate - exceeding 20,000 by November - unless more is done quickly to control the outbreak.The New England Journal of Medicine published a report Tuesday by WHO's Ebola Response Team warning that efforts to isolate patients, increase clinical care, safely bury bodies and engage the community must improve quickly to avoid a sharp increase in cases.WHO Strategy Director Christopher Dye, a co-author of the report, says it is important to act now."One of the key messages that we want to get across is that we are now in the third explosive phase of growth of the epidemic," he said. "This is an exponential increase with hundreds, going into thousands of cases per week, and if we don't stop the epidemic very soon, this is going to turn from a disaster into a catastrophe."Click to enlargeThe report comes six months after the WHO was first notified of the Ebola outbreak. The virus has infected 5,864 people and killed 2,811.Tuesday's report says that although Ebola has been reported in many parts of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, more than 90 percent of the cases have been in just 14 of 67 total districts in those countries.WHO said Monday that the outbreak appears to have been stopped in Nigeria and Senegal, with no new cases in Nigeria since September 8 and none in Senegal since its first and only case was reported on August 29.Another 30 to 40 U.S. military personnel are due to arrive in West Africa on Tuesday, joining 60 Americans already there, as part of the U.S. effort to combat Ebola. The United States has committed $175 million to help combat the outbreak and is sending 3,000 troops to the region to build field hospitals and provide logistical aid.WHO has called for an end to flight cancellations and travel restrictions to the Ebola zone.  It says these measures hamper international relief efforts and hurt the countries' economies.

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/6-things-everyone-needs-stop-195147859.html	6 Things Everyone Needs To Stop Doing At Work	Flickr/Sander Spolspoel If you're keeping to yourself all day, it could be hurting your productivity.Everyone wants to make the most of the workday, but there are several bad habits — like c onstantly checking Facebook or neglecting to make to-do lists —  that many people form that keep them from being as productive as they'd like.Here are six of them:Checking your personal Facebook.While social media has become an integral part of corporate marketing and customer engagement, your personal accounts can wait. Scrolling through Instagram or catching up on your Facebook newsfeed only distracts you during the workday. "Use a website blocker service to prevent you from accessing your personal sites both on the computer and any mobile devices you may have with you," Annaliese Henwood, a content marketing specialist at Virtual Forge Inc., recommends in a LinkedIn post.Dedication at work is crucial to doing a good job, but being available 24/7 can quickly lead to burnout, Henwood warns. "Don't allow yourself to come to work extra early or stay at work extra late when it really isn't necessary," she says. "If you stay focused and committed during work hours, it should be easier to finish tasks so that you don't have to stay late."Not making a to-do list.If you trust yourself to remember every task from memory alone, you're likely setting yourself up to forget something important. "Even with a really good memory, you still might have trouble maintaining proper prioritization," Henwood says. "You might miss tasks or fail to do the more important ones before the less important ones." Instead, she suggests using a task-tracking app so you can always see and update your to-do list.View gallery. Joe Raedle/Getty Images You should always find time for lunch. Skipping lunch.Everyone has days where making time for lunch just doesn't seem possible. However, failing to properly fuel your body leaves you exhausted and unproductive. Find time to eat something every day, but make sure it's helping your body, not dragging you down, Henwood warns. "Eat lunch, but avoid anything unhealthy or heavy," she says. "If you eat too much or choose anything too unhealthy, you risk experiencing the opposite effect where you become more tired."Your coworkers don't have to be your best friends, but it's important to interact and form relationships with them. "You can lose touch with your purpose and motivation when you stay isolated in your own space," Henwood explains. "It can cause you to feel lonely and even lower your mood and productivity." She suggests finding moments to chat and catch up with your colleagues, such as in the break room or while grabbing a cup of coffee."There will be times when you'll hit a roadblock in one or more assignments," Henwood says.  "You shouldn't just guess or leave it undone because that can lead to errors." If you're truly stuck, don't try and solve the problem yourself and risk screwing up. Instead, reach out to a coworker or your boss — chances are, they'll be happy to help.Click here to read the full LinkedIn post.Want your business advice featured in Instant MBA?

http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/08/20/nyregion/new-york-city-summer-smells.html	The Smells of Summer	Walking into Central Park from Columbus Circle, Ms. Barel was quickly overwhelmed by the stink of a ginkgo tree.In case you did not know, ginkgo trees smell like vomit.“It’s very butyric,” Ms. Barel said.Gingko fruit contains butyric acid, which is also found in cheese and, yes, vomit, Ms. Barel explained.She added that butyric smells, while rancid on their own, were important as elements in fruity scents, like an apple or a red fruit fragrance. “They bring you all the juiciness, the sparkle,” she said.A few raindrops began to fall, and the smell of rain hitting hot pavement – an odor Ms. Lepeltier called “petrichor” – wafted up from the road. The rain also soon brought out another classic park smell: horse manure.Ms. Barel had a scientific name for that, too – “cresylic” – and noted that the smell was critical in producing some floral scents, like jasmine and ylang ylang, or leathery ones.“One fragrance that is extremely cresylic is Shalimar,” Ms. Barel said, referring to the women’s perfume by Guerlain. “A lot of people who smell Shalimar blind, they don’t like it, because they will always tell you it’s horsey, or it smells like stable. But in fact that’s the cresylic note.”
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/08/30/atlantic-city-losing-2-casinos-5k-jobs-in-3-days/20954855/	Atlantic City losing 2 casinos, 5K jobs in 3 days	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - A time few could imagine during the not-too-distant glory days of casino gambling has arrived in Atlantic City, where two casinos will close this weekend and a third will shut down in two weeks.More than 5,000 workers will lose their jobs in an unprecedented weekend in the seaside gambling resort, leaving many feeling betrayed by a system that once promised stable, well-paying jobs.The Showboat is closing Sunday, followed by Revel on Monday and Tuesday. Trump Plaza is next, closing Sept. 16. To the thousands who will be left behind, it still seems unreal."We never thought this would happen," said Chris Ireland, who has been a bartender at the Showboat since it opened. His wife works there, too, as a cocktail server. Before dinnertime Sunday, neither will have a job.What makes it even tougher to swallow is that the Showboat - one of four Atlantic City casinos owned by Caesars Entertainment - is still turning a profit. But the company says it is closing Showboat to help reduce the total number of casinos in Atlantic City. Caesars also teamed with Tropicana Entertainment to buy the Atlantic Club last December and close it in January."They just want to eliminate competition," Ireland said. "Everyone's in favor of a free market until it doesn't exactly work for them."Yet many analysts and casino executives say the painful contraction now shrinking Atlantic City's casino market is exactly what the city needs to survive. Since 2006, Atlantic City's casino revenue has fallen from $5.2 billion to $2.86 billion last year, and it will fall further this year. Atlantic City will end the year with eight casinos after beginning the year with 12.New casinos popping up in an already saturated Northeastern U.S. gambling market aren't expanding the overall pie but are slicing it into ever-smaller pieces. Fewer casinos could mean better financial performance for the survivors.Resorts Casino Hotel, which was on the verge of closing a few years ago, completed a remarkable turnaround in the second quarter of this year, swinging from a $1.3 million loss last year to a $1.9 million profit this year."I truly believe that eight remaining casinos can all do very well when the gambling market is right-sized," said Resorts president Mark Giannantonio.That may be true, but it is little comfort to workers who are losing their jobs. By the time Trump Plaza shuts down in two weeks, nearly 8,000 jobs - or a quarter of Atlantic City's casino workforce - will be unemployed. A mass unemployment filing due to begin Wednesday is so large it has been booked into the city's convention center.When casino gambling was approved by New Jersey voters in 1976, it was billed as a way to revitalize Atlantic City and provide stable, lasting jobs. The first casino, Resorts, opened in 1978, kicking off three decades of soaring revenue and employment.But the Great Recession hit just as new casinos were popping up in neighboring Pennsylvania and New York, cutting deeply into Atlantic City's customer base."There was a promise when casinos came in here that these would be good, viable jobs, something you could raise your family on and have a decent life with," said Paul Smith, a cook at the Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort. "I feel so bad for all these people losing their jobs. It wasn't supposed to be like this."Mayor Don Guardian says his city is remaking itself as a more multifaceted destination, where gambling is only part of the allure. But he acknowledges the pain this weekend will bring."This is going to be a difficult few weeks for many of us in Atlantic City," he said. "People will lose their jobs, and that is never good news. Our hearts go out to our neighbors and friends. We still have difficult waters to navigate." More AOL Content: Obama's advice for Americans on Labor Day Oilman's divorce could be most expensive ever

The company’s founders told Fast Company how they noticed something interesting when comparing essays from current Harvard and Stanford students—and it had to do with their parents.Harvard students were much more likely to call the ’rents “mother” and “father,” but Stanford students were much more likely to call them “mom” and “dad.”AdmitSee also found that Harvard likes bummer essays. Co-founder Stephanie Shyu told Fast Company the words “cancer,” “difficult,” “hard,” and “tough” appeared more frequently on Harvard essays, and that students were more likely to discuss challenges they had overcome in their lives. Stanford students, on the other hand were more likely to include the words “happy,” “passion,” “better,” and “improve,” and to discuss their family backgrounds or issues they cared about.“Extrapolating from this qualitative data, it seems like Stanford is more interested in the student’s personality, while Harvard appears to be more interested in the student’s track record of accomplishment,” she told Fast Company.Shyu and her co-founder Lydia Pierce Fayal also analyzed essays from other high-ranking schools. They found that Brown hopefuls should write about volunteer or public service work, while those hoping to attend Cornell or the University of Pennsylvania should discuss their career aspirations.This all goes to show that it really does matter how you talk about your parents — not only in front of them, but also when it comes to college applications.Related gallery: Famous Harvard alumni

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-happened-65-old-woman-021200211.html	Here's What Happened When A 65-Year-Old Woman Took Shrooms In A Lab	On a balmy August morning before the city began to fill with summer tourists, Estalyn Walcoff arrived at New York University. She was awaiting a spiritual experience.Walcoff walked into what looked like a living room.A soft brown couch with floral pillows sat in the middle; flowers and books rested atop wooden tables and lined the walls. "It seemed not study-like," Walcoff said in a YouTube video.Despite its homely appearance, Walcoff knew she had arrived to the place where she was going to be studied for science.Months before, Walcoff had volunteered to participate in a study of how the psychedelic drug psilocybin — the main psychoactive ingredient in magic mushrooms — affects the brain in cancer patients with anxiety and depression.Walcoff, 65, had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer at 60 and struggled for years with debilitating anxiety. Even on good days, her constant feelings of worry and fear hung in the back of her mind like a dark curtain.Inside the study area, Walcoff was greeted by two researchers, New York University psychotherapist Jeffrey Guss and New York University psychologist Seema Desai. The three of them sat and talked in the room for half an hour, going over the details of the study and what might happen.Then, Walcoff received a pill. For study purposes, she couldn't know whether it was a placebo or psilocybin.Walcoff swallowed the pill with a glass of water. Then she lay back on the soft brown couch and covered her eyes with eye shades as she'd been instructed to do.An Other-Worldly ExperienceWithin an hour, Walcoff felt feelings of intense panic begin to well up inside her."I experienced great anxiety," she said in the video. "I experienced it as physical pain and then I began to see that it was actually a level of my mind. And underneath that I began to feel great emotional pain."She sobbed for hours.Then the pain began to ebb slowly away. As the pain left, Walcoff felt another, much more positive feeling take its place."The worst pain and the worst fear and the worst anxiety turned into something that has opened, which is the most previous thing I've ever known," said Walcoff. "And to think I wouldn't have known it — oh my gosh I can't believe I wouldn't have known it. It was a sense, I wish I could put it into words, but a sense of connectedness that runs through all of us."Not AloneTwo years after Walcoff, 27-year-old Nick Fernandez took part in the same study. Perched atop the very same couch this March, Fernandez gradually felt "the blackness inside his head [turn] into a cascade of white dots that swiftly morphed into a kaleidoscope of geometric patterns — gears, stars, triangles, trapezoids — in all the colors of the rainbow," he told Aeon Magazine.The experience wasn't simply a slideshow of colorful shapes and patterns, however. It was a physical journey as well.In his mind, Fernandez was lead from a cemetery where he watched his own funeral to Grand Central Terminal, where he danced joyfully to symphonic music with his girlfriend. Shortly thereafter, he plunged again into darkness, this time into the labyrinthine depths of the New York City sewer system. Then he traveled skywards to the crest of the Empire State Building, where he watched the sun rise over the city.Fernandez's experience is a fairly normal one for patients who participate in the NYU study, the project's lead researcher, New York University psychiatrist Stephen Ross, told Aeon.What's Happening Inside The BrainResearch on psilocybin is beginning to let scientists understand what is going on inside the brains of people like Fernandez and Walcoff when they take psilocybin.In a new study, scientists found that the drug appears to sprout new links across different areas of the brain — regions that typically don't communicate with one another. As a result, the drug temporarily alters the brain's entire organizational framework. This is what that looks like on a brain-connection map:Journal of the Royal Society Interface Visualization of the brain connections in the brain of a person on psilocybin (right) and the brain of a person not given the drug.These new connections are likely what allow users to feel as though they see sounds or hear colors. The brain regions that detect and interpret color, for example, communicate with the brain region that processes sound.Those same shifts could also be what appears to give the drug its depression and anxiety-fighting qualities."One of the characteristics of the depressed brain is that it gets stuck in a loop, you get locked into repetitive and negative thoughts," Kings College London Center for Neuroimaging Sciences researcher and the study's lead author, Paul Expert, told Business Insider. "The idea is that using psilocybin might help break the loop and change the patterns of functional connectivity in the brain."More research on the drugs is needed, of course. Only recently has the US government begun to loosen its restrictions on studying the medical uses of psychedelics.

This article also appears in The New Republic.Kobani will fall.In a matter of hours.Or perhaps days.But the Syrian city will fall, a victim of the cynical reckoning of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who, by refusing to act and leaving his powerful army stationed along the border with Syria, just a few kilometers from the already martyred city, seems to have chosen Daesh, otherwise known as the Islamic State, over the Kurds.Kobani will be a victim of the double game of Turkey, which, after having let pass every jihadist in the region and closing its eyes to the heavy weaponry that Daesh's forwarders had been sending for weeks toward the besieged city and that is now being used to shell it, shuts everything down, blocks everything, plays the innocent while immobilizing not only its own troops but also the 10,000 Kurdish volunteers who have come forward in Turkey to try to save Kobani.The outsize miracle of the resistance of Kobani, which so far has succeeded, without resources and against unheard of violence, in delaying the advance of the religious zealots, cannot last much longer now. The fall of the city and the hoisting of the black flag of the Caliphate not only in the eastern and southern quarters but now over the last heights of a place that henceforth will be powerfully symbolic, will be a catastrophe the full extent of which has not yet been appreciated, and certainly not everywhere."At this late hour, there is only one way to save what remains of Kobani, and that way is Turkey."It will be a catastrophe for the combatants both male and female who for weeks have been struggling with unbelievable courage against better-armed units that will make them pay very dearly indeed for their audacity.It will be a catastrophe for the city itself, where Daesh will not be content, as it has been before, to enslave the women, behead the leaders, or forcibly convert the practitioners of minority religions, but that will assume its place in the long and terrible list of martyred cities of recent decades: Guernica pulverized by the aircraft of the Condor Legion; Coventry razed by the Heinkels of the Luftwaffe; Stalingrad and its million dead; Sarajevo, which escaped with its life, but at the price of 11,000 dead during a thousand-day siege; Grozny, in Chechnya, ground into a ghost town by Putin's rabble; Aleppo, in Syria, with its treasures of civilization and beauty buried by the explosives dropped from Bashar al-Assad's planes; and now Kobani, the existence of which was unknown to most of us until recently but that it is about to become an urbicide.It will be a catastrophe, beyond Kobani proper, for secular Kurdistan, the incarnation (if one exists) of the values of moderation and law that the diplomats state as their wish for the Islamic world, and whose Peshmerga, moreover, are the only ones to have taken literally the global order to mobilize against the Daesh hordes and to fight, face to face on the front line against a self-proclaimed state that threatens, as we have been amply warned, not just Kurdistan, but humanity itself.Because Kobani is not only a symbol but a key, its fall will be a catastrophe, finally, for the coalition of which it is the forward outpost, a coalition that will now see the barbarians of Daesh carve out a wide swath of ground several hundreds of kilometers long adjacent to the Turkish border -- a considerable tactical and strategic advantage.To prevent this disaster we have not only very little time but, above all, paltry means. The coalition may decide to intensify its strikes, but how does one strike from the air when the battle is being waged hand to hand, street by street, house by house on the outskirts of the city?The coalition may choose to deliver arms. Even without Turkish assistance, it has the logistical ability to do so. And if it does not do so -- if it does not resolve to reestablish a measure of balance between the jihadists who have brought in heavy artillery, sophisticated rocket launchers, and tanks taken from the arsenals of Mosul and Tabah, while the Kurds are armed only with Kalashnikovs, DFDS machine guns, and a few mortars, the citizens of the world still have the freedom to do what we did not so long ago for little Bosnia, which, like Kurdish Kobani, was defending us by defending itself -- but what we lack is time. Time is required to organize an airlift of weapons to a besieged population caught in a vise, and time is what we do not have.At this late hour, there is only one way to save what remains of Kobani, and that way is Turkey.Erdogan, whose judgment has been clouded by his obsessional fear of seeing an embryonic Kurdish state created just outside his borders, must be reminded -- once again -- that Daesh is no less his enemy and that it is for Turkey that the bell tolls in Kobani.He must be made to understand that if his increasingly authoritarian and benighted regime, one that strays ever farther from the secular foundations of Kemalism, is to preserve its chance to forge the economic partnerships with Europe (and eventually, the political partnerships) to which Turkey's elites aspire and that the country sorely needs, that chance passes through Kobani and its defense: That chance depends on the aid delivered to the heroines and the heroes of the beleaguered city.But we have to go even further and tell Erdogan, formally or informally, that the battle against Daesh is the moment of truth, the now or never, for the alliances and the system of collective security that was established in the region in the aftermath of the Second World War, a system in which Turkey is more than an ordinary member, having become its eastern pillar when it joined NATO in 1952."If Turkey stands down a third time -- if Kobani becomes the name of yet another Turkish default, this one inexcusable -- its future in NATO is in doubt."In 1991, Turkey only reluctantly joined in operations to support the civilian population of northern Iraq.On March 1, 2003, Turkey's Grand National Assembly, in a vote that cast a long shadow over the country's relations with its allies, voted against allowing 62,000 American troops to pass through Turkey on their way to Baghdad or to be based in Turkey.If Turkey stands down a third time -- if Kobani becomes the name of yet another Turkish default, this one inexcusable -- its future in NATO is in doubt.The emissaries of President Barack Obama who have just arrived in Ankara should make this very clear.French President François Hollande, who has given Turkey many signs of friendship, should assume the role of spokesman for France's partners by informing Erdogan that Kobani is a rampart for Europe.Here, as at the siege of Madrid, the world must declare, "They shall not pass."Translated from French by Steven B. Kennedy.

All things (including alcohol) in moderation.We’ve all seen these headlines, pithily summing up research on why a modest amount of alcohol every day won’t harm, and in fact may help, our cardiac health.But a new study from University of Gothenburg in Sweden suggests that the protective benefits of alcohol are only present if you have a certain genotype, or genetic makeup. And your odds for having it aren’t good; it’s estimated that only 15 percent of the population have this particular genotype."Moderate drinking alone does not have a strong protective effect,” said Professor Lauren Lissner, a study co-author in a statement. "Nor does this particular genotype. But the combination of the two appears to significantly reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.”The findings were published in late October in the journal Alcohol.The researchers came to their conclusion after analyzing the genomes and comparing the drinking habits of two randomly-sampled groups: 618 people with coronary heart disease, and a control group of 2,921 people.Both groups answered questionnaires detailing what kinds of alcohol they liked to drink, how often they drank and other lifestyle and socioeconomic factors like smoking habits, exercise habits, marital status and leisure activity.Then the researchers analyzed the blood of both groups to search for the CETP gene. The CETP gene is known to regulate the process of transporting cholesterol from the peripheral arteries to the liver, which helps reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. A study from 1995 demonstrated how the process is influenced (positively) by alcohol, but subsequent studies hadn’t been able to fully replicate the result.They found that only people with a certain CETP gene variation had the strongest link between a lower risk of coronary heart disease and moderate amounts of alcohol intake. While much more research on the subject is needed, the hope is that a simple test will eventually be able to tell people which category they belong to, said study co-author Professor Dag Thelle of the University of Gothenburg."Assuming that we are able to describe these mechanisms, it may be a simple matter one day to perform genetic testing and determine whether someone belongs to the lucky 15 [percent],” Thelle said in the statement. "That would be useful to know when offering advice on healthy alcohol consumption.”This is the second time that a study has demonstrated a link between alcohol consumption, cardiac health and this specific genotype. The first was the aforementioned 1995 study, which analyzed 1,236 men from Northern Ireland and France. The current study included both men and women, but its conclusions showed a stronger link between genotype, alcohol consumption and cardiac disease protection among men, while the link was weaker (researchers called it “suggestive”) in women -- perhaps because there were only 165 women in the whole study, noted researchers in the study abstract.

Matt Damon will reprise his role as Jason Bourne for fourth time.Damon's best friend Ben Affleck revealed the news to E! News at an event celebrating the duo's show Project Greenlight. "Well, [Damon's] going to be doing a Bourne movie next fall when I've just lost any semblance of physical fitness," Affleck said.Damon confirmed the news, saying: "Yes, next year. It'll be in 2016 when the movie will actually come out. [Director] Paul Greengrass is going to do another one and that's all I ever said. I just needed him to say yes."The grossest zombies on The Walking Dead so farThe actor starred in the first three Bourne films, the latter two of which Greengrass directed. Damon had previously stated that he wouldn't reprise his role without Greengrass' involvement, so for the fourth installment, Jeremy Renner was brought on to star as an original character named Aaron Cross.Last year, Greengrass told Deadline he had no plans to return to the franchise. "In the end I felt I had given it my all in two films I'm very proud of and didn't want to make another if I didn't believe it could be as good if not better," the director said. "I couldn't come up with an idea, and the business reality of franchises is that when a studio has a Bourne, they're obliged to make one every couple of years. I discovered in my heart I didn't have another one in me."Much to the delight of Bourne fans, Greengrass has apparently changed his mind.Are you excited for more Bourne?On the set of Once Upon a Time: Why is Regina back to being the Evil Queen?

The longtime fan brought a sign to hold up at the show that read: “Chemo this morning, Garth tonight, enjoying ‘The Dance,’” referencing one of the country star’s hits.“That’s one of my favorite songs of his,” Shaw told WCCO-TV.So when Brooks started singing “The Dance” at the Target Center in Minneapolis that night, Shaw wanted very much to get closer to the stage."The next thing I knew, another usher was coming up to me and were like, 'Follow us,'" the 46-year-old mom of three told KARE-11. “And they took me to the very front, right in front of [Brooks].”About a minute into the song, the camera caught Shaw’s sign, prompting cheers from the crowd. A minute later, Brooks walked to the edge of the stage, sat down right in front of an awestruck Shaw and began serenading her. Moments later, he took her hand and gave her his guitar."To give away something like that is just remarkable, and now if I ever have a bad day, I can always go look at his guitar and get inspiration," Shaw told KARE-11.As the song ended, Brooks and Shaw embraced, and the singer planted a kiss atop her head. He then stood, Shaw’s sign in his hand and exclaimed: “God just stuck his hand out and wrote this … You have all my strength, you have everybody’s strength in here and you go kick cancer’s ass!”Scroll to 2:10 in the video below to watch the moving encounter:Shaw told WCCO-TV that the experience was “overwhelming, humbling.”“You never expect that from anybody, especially a big superstar,” she said.As Taste of Country notes, Brooks is no stranger to the pain of cancer. He lost both his mother and sister to the disease.

And that ignorance is great, because most of that microscopic world is scary as hell. Cracked has touched on some of these horrors before, but like the Leprechaun movies, the terror could not be confined to just one installment.#11. Your PillowAt Normal Size:Odds are there's at least one pillow lying on your bed right now, but here's a picture anyway:Getty Everyone on board so far?You rest your head on one almost every night (excepting those instances where you wake up in a daze on bloodied tile/pavement with a racketeer's jawbone in your vest pocket). It is a place of warmth, comfort and security.But Up Close ...You couldn't be more wrong. This is your bedroom pillow this very second:Unseen Companions "We're just waiting for an ear to crawl into." via Apartment TherapyThose are common house dust mites. There's about a bajillion of these micro horrors living inside your pillow as we speak. We couldn't find a source saying that they crawl all over your face and into your ears and nose while you sleep, but really, do you trust them not to? They graze on your pillow like bloated alien cattle and feed off of your dead skin cells (and presumably your terror-soaked nightmares as well).#10. Hydrothermal Vent WormsAt Normal Size:Hydrothermal vent worms are so tiny that you can't see them. They live around the hydrothermal vents on the abyssal plain of the ocean floor, which is probably another big reason you can't see them:Oh, they're in there.

Also, try to play it cool, but it's behind you.Fortunately, its mouth is less than a millimeter wide, but rest assured -- if it could, that worm would devour everything you have ever loved.#9. Your TongueGettyAt Normal Size:Your tongue is that thing sitting in your mouth right now:GettyYou can't avoid touching it, and if you've ever made out with someone, you've been rubbing two of them together at the same time.

Imagine it.Science Photo Library This is precisely what John Lennon was thinking about when he wrote that song.#8. SexAt Normal Size:The Internet contains the most extensive and specific visual library of sex in the known universe, so we really don't need to show you a picture.

http://news.yahoo.com/drunken-party-costs-9-rookie-cops-jobs-163557424.html	Drunken party costs 9 rookie cops their jobs	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) — Nine rookie police officers have been fired for their behavior at a drunken graduation party in northern New Jersey.In announcing the dismissals the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said Friday the incident has prompted a review of the process for selecting and training candidates. The officers were part of the agency's largest-ever graduating class.Several other officers and supervisors face disciplinary proceedings or suspensions stemming from the party at a Hoboken bar on Aug. 23, the agency said."This is a sad day for the Port Authority Police Department," Executive Director Patrick Foye said in a statement. "We are extremely disappointed by the conduct of the probationary officers involved and appalled by the poor judgment of the Academy staff members in attendance. The Port Authority is justly proud of the history and dedication of its police department and views the conduct in question as deeply troubling."The agency investigated after news reports emerged of an out-of-control party at the Texas Arizona Bar and Grill. The officers were terminated for their conduct and for not being truthful during the investigative process, according to a Port Authority spokesman, who would not elaborate on the nature of the conduct.In addition to the officers who were fired, three other new officers were suspended without pay for 30 days and will have their probationary status extended for a year. Three supervisors and two other officers will face disciplinary proceedings.No names were released.The cost of training a Port Authority police officer is about $36,000, an agency spokesman said. The Port Authority operates bridges, tunnels, airports and ports in the New York metropolitan area as well as the World Trade Center site in lower Manhattan.The new officers could be terminated without union representation because they were still in their one-year probationary period, the spokesman said.A spokesman for the Port Authority Police Benevolent Association said the union is reviewing the firings."Though this decision is the result of an internal investigation, the PAPBA was not made aware of any specific charges leading to the terminations," spokesman Robert Egbert said. "The PAPBA is currently reviewing the Port Authority's actions."The 249 cadets who graduated in August represented the largest graduating class in the department's 86-year history. Among the 210 men and 39 women were two sons of officers killed in the line of duty on Sept. 11, 2001.
http://nypost.com/2014/12/30/it-was-rough-man-rex-ryan-speaks-to-cap-his-whirlwind-day/	It was rough, man': Rex Ryan speaks to cap his whirlwind day	ORLANDO, Fla. — It certainly did not take Rex Ryan very long to move on — into his Jets afterlife.In less time than it took for the Jets to defeat the Dolphins in their season finale Sunday at Sun Life Stadium, Ryan woke up Monday morning, went to the office, got fired, went back home to pick up his wife and flew back to Florida to watch his son’s Clemson Tigers play in the Russell Athletic Bowl.The Ryans’ son, Seth, is a red-shirt freshman reserve receiver for 17th-ranked Clemson, which routed Oklahoma, 40-6. He got into the game on the Tigers’ last three offensive plays, but did not have a pass thrown to him.Rex Ryan — wearing a white T-shirt with “Clemson’’ written across the chest in orange letters, a white Clemson ball cap with an orange tiger paw on it and black sweat pants — was accompanied by his wife, Michelle.About 12 hours earlier, Ryan was fired from his dream job by Jets owner Woody Johnson, but he hardly wore the look of a guy who was feeling sorry for himself Monday night. Ryan looked relaxed and happy.Asked what Monday morning was like speaking to his players for the last time, Ryan said, “It was rough, man. But hey, that’s the way it is.’’Ryan then said: “I’m going to go now, because this really isn’t supposed to be about me. It’s about my kid, man.’’Ryan then put his arm around his wife and whisked her off into the sea of orange-clad Clemson fans — and he now awaits his next career opportunity.Ryan did not make himself available to reporters after his firing — going out with a whimper after such a blustery beginning to his Jets tenure. But, addressing his future after the win over the Dolphins, he defiantly told reporters: “Understand this: I’m not afraid of anything. I’m not afraid of what lies ahead.’’Nor should he be. Ryan is 52 and in the prime of his coaching career. Sure, he missed the playoffs the last four years, but he also coached the Jets to two AFC Championship games. There are not a lot of coaches in the market for jobs with that on their résumés.It is also widely known around the NFL that Ryan was dealt a weak hand personnel-wise the last few years, though he hardly should be exonerated from fault for the Jets’ demise, because he surely played his part.Ryan might not want to concede this publicly, but being fired Monday was a relief of sorts. He needed a change of scenery, and now he can get it.Rex Ryan is introduced as head coach by Jets owner Woody Johnson on Jan. 21, 2009. It was an action-packed six years until his firing Monday morning.

The Bears fired their head coach, Marc Trestman. And former 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh is virtually signed and sealed at Michigan.Add to that the Raiders’ open job and Ryan is staring at three potential places that would seem like a perfect fit for him with the most attractive candidate (Harbaugh) now out of the mix.In Atlanta, Ryan would have a ready-made offense in place led by franchise quarterback Matt Ryan, needing only to fix the defense, which of course is his specialty.In Oakland, where the Raiders were in hot pursuit of Harbaugh, Ryan would also inherit a potential franchise quarterback in Derek Carr.In Chicago, the quarterback situation is a bit complicated with the staggering regression of Jay Cutler. And Ryan would be returning to a place his father was a hero as the Bears defensive coordinator during their 1985 Super Bowl run.If no team hires Ryan as its head coach in 2015, he is believed to already have a TV contract in place at ESPN. So don’t feel too sorry for Ryan. He’s going to be just fine.So on Monday, hours after being bounced from his dream job after six years, Ryan did what he always does: He went out and had a good time.
http://www.totalprosports.com/2014/10/24/royals-peanut-guy-world-series/	Royals Peanut Guy with Amazing Arm Will Restore Your Faith in Humanity (Video)	Being a Royals peanut guy is a pretty thankless job. The hours are long, you don’t get to watch the games, the benefits suck (haha jk there are no benefits!), and Kansas City summers can be pretty damn hot.However, as we learned from Game 2 of the World Series between the Royals and Giants on Wednesday night, if you stick with it, you will eventually get your chance to shine.You see, for some reason, fans in the upper deck at Kauffman Stadium were not getting adequate peanut service on Wednesday night, so they called down to the peanut guy in the field boxes for assistance. That peanut guy, recognizing that this might be his only chance to show the world what he can do, was happy to oblige. So he wound up and fired a legume laser beam to the upper deck, like a boss, earning a raucous ovation from the crowd.Then the guy in the upper deck crumpled a five dollar bill into a ball and tossed it down to the guy, completing what I can only assume is the most amazing baseball stadium food transaction in MLB postseason history.Take a look:Well done, Royals peanut guy. You and your customer have restored my faith in humanity.Hat Tip – [Deadspin]

The grieving mother also insisted that Wilson "wanted to kill someone."The devastated woman's comments came one day after Wilson told ABC News that he has "a clean conscience" following a grand jury's decision to not indict him for the murder."I don't believe a word of it," McSpadden told "CBS This Morning." "I know my son far too well, he would never [attack a cop], he would never provoke anyone to do anything to him, and he would never do anything to anybody."Wilson has insisted in both grand jury testimony and to ABC that Brown repeatedly hit him in the face and made him fear for his life. The police officer says he had no choice but to shoot Brown dead as he furiously charged towards him.McSpadden is calling into question whether Brown ever attacked Wilson."My son does not have a history of violence, one image does not paint an image of a person's entire life," she told CBS.If something happened in that store – and that's a big if – it could have been dealt with," she continued. "But you didn't have to do what you did. He didn't do what he had to do, he did what he wanted to do."I don't think he wanted to kill my son, but he wanted to kill someone," she angrily insisted. "His conscience is clear? How could your conscious be clear after killing somebody even if it was an accidental death?"Michael Brown Sr. was with McSpadden for both interviews, their outrage carried over to NBC's "Today Show.""Who in their right mind would charge an officer who has his gun drawn?" The father asked. "It sounds crazy."McSpadden called Wilson's statements about her son's demeanor during the altercation "insult after injury, so disrespectful."She also insisted to CBS that not a single local official has approached her to offer condolences or an apology, regardless of the grand jury outcome."We've just been disrespected all the way around," said Brown Sr., adding that Wilson has always been "known for falsifying his reports."McSpadden was inconsolable towards the end of the CBS interview, even breaking down into tears at one point."We couldn't even have our sons organs donated, you understand that?" she said. "They wrong, they know they wrong."Attorney Benjamin Crump also said that a civil lawsuit is on the way."This family plans to exhaust every possible legal option for justice."
http://www.inquisitr.com/1645706/atlanta-fire-chief-suspended-for-publishing-views-on-gay-lifestyle/	Atlanta Fire Chief Suspended For Publishing Views On Gay Lifestyle	Atlanta’s Fire Chief Kelvin Cochran has been hit with a one-month unpaid suspension for comments about homosexuality in a religious-oriented book that he authored. The chief was also ordered into sensitivity trainingChief Cochran’s book reportedly denounces promiscuous sex by males outside of marriage (whether with the opposite sex or same sex) and also refers to same-sex relationships as a form of sexual perversion.The chief is apparently a devout Christian and a deacon of a local church. Cohran’s 30-day suspension will cost him about $14,000 in pay, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.This his second stint as Atlanta’s fire rescue department chief; in between he served as U.S. Fire Administrator in the Obama administration.Cochran may have run into trouble by allegedly handing out copies of the book in the firehouse, but the suspension is evidently based upon publishing the book without the permission or knowledge of the city of Atlanta. City officials have also apparently opened a probe to determine if Cochran discriminated against any employee, or created what the law calls a hostile work environment.One local LGBT group is demanding that Cochran be fired.“In the book based on Christian values, Cochran identifies himself as Atlanta’s fire chief and says his first priority as chief is to run the department ‘to cultivate its culture to the glory of God,'” WSB-TV reported. The city only learned about the book’s existence after some employees complained about it earlier this month.Published almost exactly one year ago, his 162-page book, called Who Told You That You Were Naked?, means nakedness in the biblical or spiritual sense according to the Amazon description. “From God’s perspective nakedness meant so much more. It meant condemnation and deprivation to his most precious creation — mankind.”The title language is found in Genesis 3:11, and the content of the book is said to be based on lesson plans originally prepared for men’s bible study groups.Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed was one of several municipal officials critical of Cochran’s tome. “I want to be clear that the material in Chief Cochran’s book is not representative of my personal beliefs, and is inconsistent with the administration’s work to make Atlanta a more welcoming city for all of her citizens — regardless of their sexual orientation, gender, race and religious beliefs,” the mayor explained in a recent statement about the controversy.Chief Cochran has been a firefighter since he joined the Shreveport, La., department in 1981.The chief told WSB-TV that he is looking forward to explaining himself once his suspension ends.[image via YouTube]
http://news.yahoo.com/photos/stark-photos-of-california-s-devastating-drought-1415386386-slideshow/	Stark photos of California’s devastating drought	California is in the midst of its worst drought in more than a century. More than half the state is in “exceptional drought,” the driest conditions possible, according to the United States Drought Monitor. And after three straight years of little rainfall and predictions of a drier than usual winter, there’s no sign of relief. The pain of the drought has been felt sharpest in California’s Central Valley, long described as the nation’s breadbasket because it provides more than 50 percent of the country’s food supply. Water reservoirs are empty, and wells have run dry. Residents in some tiny towns have no running water at all. Many have likened it to a modern day Dust Bowl, and photographer Matt Black has been documenting it all, producing stark images that are eerily reminiscent of the work produced by actual Dust Bowl photographers, including Dorothea Lange and Arthur Rothstein. But it’s more than just a photography project. It’s personal. Black, who grew up in Visalia, Calif., the agricultural heart of the Central Valley, has been documenting the land of his childhood slowly waste away, starved of the water that farmers desperately need to keep their crops and livelihoods alive. He’s been focused not just on the land but on the people—the farmers and the workers, both—who are struggling to survive. His photos of California’s devastating drought, part of an ongoing series called “The Dry Land,” will go on exhibit at 7:30pm on Nov. 11 at The Half King in New York, where Black will also show “California: Paradise Burning,” a short film he produced with photographer Ed Kashi. The exhibit runs until Dec. 13. (Yahoo News)Find more news related pictures in our photo galleries and follow us on Tumblr.
http://tv.yahoo.com/news/selena-gomez-reveals-justin-biebers-191200564.html	Selena Gomez Reveals Justin Bieber's Reaction to Video: It Was Hard for Him to Watch	After the release of her tearful music video "The Heart Wants What It Wants," Selena Gomez showed up on Thursday's On-Air with Ryan Seacrest and revealed what Justin Bieber thought of the heartbreaking, autobiographical song and how their relationship took her to such a breaking point.The most emotional part of the video comes within the first moments of seconds when we hear her voice emotionally talking about her very public relationship. "You make me feel crazy, you make feel like it’s my fault," she's heard saying as she cries. "I was in pain.” It was a very vulnerable moment and the 22-year-old singer reveals how they captured something so raw and real. VIDEO: Selena Reveals Her Celeb Crush"They taped the mic underneath the table when I was shooting the video," she explains, about to cry all over again. "And I went in and I went into the room by myself, and I looked at the actual mirror in the music video, and I had a conversation [with] myself to every question I had in my mind in that moment: ‘Wow, this feeling changes everything and you can’t help it.'”As for how Bieber, 20, responded to the video, she tells Seacrest that he thought it was beautiful. "I think it was really hard," she says of his reaction, before adding jokingly, "I think he was a little jealous of the video guy at first."Commenting on the meaning behind "The Heart Wants What It Wants", Gomez admits that both her and Bieber had an issue with "identity" this year. As she's admitted in the past, she's still trying to discover who she is, and says this was one of the reasons the two have had such a back and forth romance.PHOTOS: Selena and Justin Spotted in Canada Together -- On Again?"I was trying to figure out what I'm doing, and that was the first time I was constantly being kicked down for doing that,'" she explains. "And yeah, I made some decisions that weren't great as well, and so did [Justin] and that's why we went through all that to only make us better."Even after such a tumultuous romance, Gomez tells Seacrest she's still in Bieber's corner. "I support him. I think I always will. I'm upset when he's upset, I'm happy when he's happy. I don't want anything bad ever happen to him. It hurts me. That's all."NEWS: Is Justin Trying to Win Back Selena on Instagram?While she's still on her journey to self discovery, Gomez says she's not alone in this struggle. "Honestly, music is an expression, and if you will be that voice for these girls, there are some people that feel this. This is universal."The former Disney star also shared the video and song with her famous friend Taylor Swift -- who's notorious for singing about her own love life -- to get her take. " "She loved it," Gomez recalls. "She had headphones in, and she watched the video, and then she just looked at me, then she looked back, and then played it three times over and over again. And I'm like, 'I want to know,' and she was like, 'Oh my God. This is amazing. I'm so excited for you.'"PHOTOS: 22 Times Selena Was Too Pretty for WordsGomez says she's excited to have released this video at the end of the year as it's given her a bit of closure. "[I learned] how to love myself first. And not just in a relationship, just my everyday life."
http://news.yahoo.com/chinas-army-issue-underwear-reveals-145542662.html	What China's Army-issue underwear reveals	Beijing — There’s a lot to learn from an article that just appeared on the website of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army; for example, Chinese soldiers’ underpants were equipped with elasticated waistbands only in the 21st  century.Until recently, the article recalls, an infantryman would “have to worry about the rope of his big underpants, which would loosen suddenly but could never be untied when he wanted to answer the call of nature.”Behind this tantalizing tidbit lies an illuminating point: Chinese military planners pay more attention to aircraft carriers and satellite-killer rockets than they do to their foot soldiers. Chinese infantrymen have a tradition of stripped-down fighting that dates back to the days when the Communist Party was fighting a guerrilla war before the revolution. Money is no longer so scarce, but Beijing is still not spending much on its lowly grunts.The battlefield equipment that the average Chinese fighter wears would cost the equivalent of “two entry level iPhone6's,” says the article. His American counterpart would be carrying gear worth 10 times that, the equivalent of “a mid-level car,” according to the reporter’s estimate.An example: US soldiers wear Kevlar helmets equipped with communications technology. Most Chinese soldiers, the article says, are still wearing steel helmets; only a minority have Kevlar models and none of them have earphones or microphones.“Communications basically relies on yelling,” the article quotes a soldier on the point of retiring after 16 years’ service, Wang Fujian, as saying.Still, they can consider themselves lucky to have helmets at all. During the last war that Chinese troops fought – a border conflict with Vietnam in 1979 – helmets were not even standard issue, scorned as “equipment of the weak,” the article recalls.That kind of thinking has not entirely died out in the Chinese military. Although China is the largest exporter in the world of body armor, very few of its soldiers are provided with bulletproof jackets. “Some leaders think that it is too indulgent to wrap soldiers with too much equipment,” the article quotes a PLA logistics instructor, Cui Xianwei, as saying.That attitude contrasts sharply with the approach taken by the US Army, which provides dismounted soldiers with Kevlar boxers to protect them against improvised explosive devices.An elasticated waistband – and a fetching camouflage pattern according to an illustration on the website – is as high tech as Chinese military underwear gets.China has the second largest military budget in the world, (far) behind the United States. “But in fact, second place did not bring Chinese soldiers more sense of security,” the PLA website article says.It points out that according to an article published by the state-run news agency Xinhua earlier this year, spending on soldiers’ individual equipment has remained flat for the past five years, even as the overall military budget has doubled.That is counterproductive, suggests one unnamed PLA political officer quoted in the article. “We educate soldiers that we shall fear neither hardship nor death,” he says. “But if we provide him with advanced protective equipment he will feel very assured, and as a result he will have more confidence to win the war.”

As Jon Stewart learned on Thursday night's "Daily Show," it might be millennials from Western nations who were recruited to join the jihad."Millennials. That's right. Millennials have been Trojan-horsed into the War on Terror," Stewart said. "Wait until these brutal fundamentalists of ISIS get a taste of the entitlement generation."Disaffected youths have fled their Western homelands to join the cause, only to quit in disappointment. Some don't want to do the drudgery of cooking and cleaning in terror camps, some have complained about the lack of healthcare and one even quit because his iPod stopped working."It's not witnessing the brutality firsthand that's putting a wedge between them and jihad," Stewart said. "It's that they can't listen to Taylor Swift's new album."Check out the full clip, above.
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-text-one-iran-deals-212101390.html	Here's the text of one of the Iran deal's 'secret' side agreements	(AP) In this file photo taken Tuesday, Dec. 9, 2014, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, right, and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif listen to the Iranian national anthem ahead of the On Wednesday, The Associated Press published an instantly controversial report claiming that Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) had entered into a confidential agreement that allowed Tehran to carry out its own inspections at Parchin, a military facility where Iran is suspected of testing nuclear bomb detonators more than a decade ago.The report claimed that under the agreement, IAEA inspectors would be prohibited from entering the site, where Iranian officials would be allowed to collect their own environmental samples. Iran would provide inspectors with photos and video of certain — but not all — sensitive areas at Parchin as well.Changes in the text of The AP report led to speculation that the news agency had been selectively publishing or distorting parts of the confidential agreement between the agency and Tehran, which even US Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged he had not personally seen during July congressional hearings.Now, The AP has published what it describes as a draft of that document. According to two anonymous sources, the draft does not substantially differ from the final text. Here it is in its entirety:Separate arrangement II agreed by the Islamic State of Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency on 11 July 2015, regarding the Road-map, Paragraph 5Iran and the Agency agreed on the following sequential arrangement with regard to the Parchin issue:1. Iran will provide to the Agency photos of the locations, including those identified in paragraph 3 below, which would be mutually agreed between Iran and the Agency, taking into account military concerns.1. Iran will provide to the Agency videos of the locations, including those identified in paragraph 3 below, which would be mutually agreed between Iran and the Agency, taking into account military concerns.1. Iran will provide to the Agency 7 environmental samples taken from points inside one building already identified by the Agency and agreed by Iran, and 2 points outside of the Parchin complex which would be agreed between Iran and the Agency.1. The Agency will ensure the technical authenticity of the activities referred to in paragraphs 1-3 above. Activities will be carried out using Iran's authenticated equipment, consistent with technical specifications provided by the Agency, and the Agency's containers and seals.1. The above mentioned measures would be followed, as a courtesy by Iran, by a public visit of the Director General, as a dignitary guest of the Government of Iran, accompanied by his deputy for safeguards.6. Iran and the Agency will organize a one-day technical roundtable on issues relevant to Parchin.Parchin isn't that important on its own. Nuclear weapons-related work at the site probably ended years ago. "Parchin is a red herring," Aaron Stein of the Royal United Services Institute told Vox. "They won't find anything there — it's completely stripped of anything of value."But the final text confirms that at least one aspect of the IAEA's road map — the agreement meant to resolve the agency's numerous outstanding questions on the status of Iran's nuclear weaponization program — was settled on terms favorable to Iran.Iran has barred IAEA inspectors from Parchin despite nearly a decade of requests for access. The roadmap, which is meant to settle years of unanswered questions about Iran's nuclear weaponization drive, apparently doesn't change that.If the Parchin investigation is happening on Tehran 's terms, it raises the possibility that the rest of the roadmap inquiry will be carried out under a process that Iran can strongly influence or even control.This is by design: As Ali Akbar Saheli, the head of Iran's atomic energy agency told regime-linked media in early August, one of Iran's negotiating objectives was limiting the IAEA's reach inside of the country, according to a report from the Washington Institute for Near East Studies:We do not have an optimistic view of the [IAEA]. There is no doubt that they will release the information [that we are giving them]. We need to be careful in the information that we supply to them ...We are not only dealing with the agency and these spies. We are dealing with all the countries that own nuclear programs. There are formulas and methods to prevent supplying information to the agency's inspectors. We did not know about these methods in the past and supplied some information that should not have been supplied.Iran's "formulas and methods" for limiting the IAEA's reach are now apparent, at least as Parchin is concerned. Whether the Parchin arrangement is part of a larger trade off to ensure IAEA access to other, possibly more important sites is currently unknown — the other implementation agreement governing whom IAEA inspectors can talk to and what facilities they can visit as part of their investigation is still secret.But there's a related and far more important ambiguity related to the roadmap.As the Washington Institute report notes, the Iranian government does not consider the roadmap to be binding upon the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the other nuclear deal Iran signed with the US and its partners in July. In Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's view, the "roadmap for resolving [military dimension] issues is independent from the JCPOA, contrary to the US view that the agreements are interdependent and mutually reinforcing."Iran doesn't think that the removal of sanctions and the implementation fo the other, more comprehensive nuclear deal should be conditioned on the results of the IAEA roadmap investigation. The roadmap's link to the main deal is clear, at least from the US's perspective: the IAEA must identify key personnel, facilities, supply chains, and past activities in order to establish exactly how far along Iran's weaponization activities really are and to recognize whether those activities have been restarted over the course of the JCPOA.Whether Rouhani's view wins out remains to be seen — under the roadmap, the IAEA must issue a report on the results of its investigation by December. But after the deal reached on Parchin, Tehran has to be liking its chances.NOW WATCH: This drummer created a whole song using only the sound of coinsMore From Business InsiderThe Iran agreement didn't deal with these 2 huge issues The real reason the Iran secret side deal is so important UN nuclear watchdog is satisfied with access to Iran's Parchin military site

http://sports.yahoo.com/news/nascars-kurt-busch-facing-assault-probe-185851690--spt.html	Kurt Busch facing domestic assault probe	DOVER, Del. (AP) -- NASCAR driver Kurt Busch has been accused of domestic assault by his ex-girlfriend, and police in Delaware said Friday they are investigating.The Dover Police Department said the allegations were brought to the department Wednesday. Busch's ex-girlfriend, Patricia Driscoll, 36, said the allegations involved an incident inside his motorhome at a race at Dover International Speedway in September. The couple broke up about a week before.Driscoll has filed court documents asking that a judge order Busch to stay away from her and not contact her. She also is asking that Busch undergo a psychiatric evaluation and be evaluated by a certified domestic violence treatment agency.The documents, filed Wednesday, say Busch was despondent the night of Sept. 26 after his poor performance at the qualifying session.''He was verbally abusive to her and said he wished he had a gun so that he could kill himself,'' the documents say.Driscoll said Busch, 36, called her names and accused her of ''having spies everywhere and having a camera on the bus to watch him.'' He then jumped up, grabbed her face and smashed her head three times against the wall next to the bed, Driscoll says in the documents.View gallery FILE - In this May 17, 2014, file photo, Kurt Busch kisses girlfriend Patricia Driscoll after he qua …Driscoll says she pushed Busch away and ran from the bedroom, going to a nearby bus to put an ice pack on her head and neck. She said the incident caused her severe pain, difficulty breathing and bruising on her neck.A hearing in the case is scheduled for Dec. 2.An attorney for Busch said he was cooperating with the investigation.''This allegation is a complete fabrication by a woman who has refused to accept the end of a relationship and Mr. Busch vehemently denies her allegations in every respect,'' attorney Rusty Hardin said in an emailed statement.NASCAR said it was aware of the situation and gathering information. Busch has not been charged. If he is, his case would play out after a series of high-profile cases involving prominent athletes ignited a national debate about how professional leagues handle allegations of abuse surface.View gallery FILE - This is a May 22, 2014, file photo showing Kurt Busch waiting by his car before practice for  …A spokesman for Stewart-Haas Racing, Mike Arning, said Busch's team was still gathering facts about the incident and not in a position to comment.Known as ''The Outlaw'' in racing circles, Busch is the 2004 NASCAR Sprint Cup champion and one of the more accomplished drivers in the series. He was in his car practicing Friday for this weekend's race at Phoenix International Raceway in Avondale, Arizona.Driscoll is an executive for a small Washington, D.C.-based defense consulting firm and president of the Armed Forces Foundation, a nonprofit for veterans. The couple met at a foundation dinner in 2011, and after hitting it off, Busch became a spokesman and ambassador for the foundation. The group severed its ties with him Friday because of the ''serious nature of the allegations.''Busch has a history of run-ins on and off the track with drivers, NASCAR officials and reporters. He was suspended by Roush Racing for the last two races of the 2005 season after police cited him for reckless driving.A fan caught Busch on video verbally abusing an ESPN reporter during the 2011 season finale, and Busch was fined $50,000 by NASCAR after the clip was posted on YouTube. He was suspended for one race in 2012 for verbally abusing a reporter.FILE - In this April 24, 2014, file photo, race car driver Kurt Busch, right, kisses his girlfriend  …Busch has seen a sports psychologist to learn to tame his emotions.But with Driscoll, he appeared to have softened his image. She and her son, Houston, became fixtures in Busch's life. The pair came across as a happy couple when Busch attempted to complete the Coca Cola 600 and the Indianapolis 500 on the same day earlier this year, a feat only a handful of other drivers have attempted. They welcomed reporters into her Ellicott City, Maryland, home and cameras followed them around for weeks for the NBC documentary ''Kurt Busch: 36.''They acted like a family: Busch, Driscoll and Houston went on a hunting trip this year in New Zealand and Busch took Houston fly fishing. The child got the nickname ''The Mini Outlaw'' as a regular at the track.She celebrated his accomplishments publicly. Busch made the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship in his first season at Stewart-Haas Racing, and Driscoll tweeted regular updates from his NASCAR races this season. They frequently embraced on the track, or were seen walking hand in hand, never shying from public displays of affection.Busch's talent has never been doubted, with 25 career Cup wins and the 2004 championship. But his prickly personality has scared away sponsors, and rides with deep-pocketed owners Jack Roush and Penske fizzled. His career detoured into journeyman status with single-car teams the last two seasons before landing at SHR.
http://www.siliconvalley.com/ci_26916459/biz-break-yahoo-pays-640m-brightroll-video-advertising	Biz Break: Yahoo pays $640M for BrightRoll in video advertising push	Today: Yahoo spends the first chunk of its Alibaba money on San Francisco video-ad startup BrightRoll, which comes with a $640 million price tag.The Lead: Yahoo agrees to pay $640 million for S.F.'s BrightRollYahoo's first big move with its overflowing war chest of Alibaba IPO money is the purchase of BrightRoll, a video-advertising company that could help CEO Marissa Mayer battle back in an ad fight against Google and Facebook.Yahoo announced Tuesday afternoon that it had committed $640 million in cash to acquire the San Francisco company, which it said will give the Sunnyvale Web company the largest video-advertising platform in the United States."BrightRoll is a terrific, strategic and financially compelling fit for our video advertising business," Yahoo's Mayer said in Tuesday's announcement, later adding, "his acquisition will accelerate the growth of both companies -- we can help BrightRoll scale to even more advertisers globally and they can bring their tremendous platform offering to Yahoo's advertisers."BrightRoll serves both buyers and sellers of video ads, connecting the two and helping to ensure delivery of commercials on the Internet. BrightRoll has focused on allowing companies to present ads across mobile devices, desktop computers and streaming services."We believe the next step for programmatic video advertising as an industry is to extend and standardize globally, make cross-device buying simple and measurable, and complement and integrate with TV," BrightRoll CEO and founder Tod Sacerdoti said in a prepared statement.With the purchase, which adds to $1.6 billion in acquisitions since Mayer took over, Yahoo hopes to fight back after being overtaken by Google and Facebook in selling web advertising. The former champ in the market, Yahoo is projected to fall to fourth this year by eMarketer, which reported in July that Yahoo collected less than 3 percent of Web advertising revenues in 2013. Google accounted for nearly 32 percent of Internet ad revenues last year, while Facebook neared 6 percent, the analysis firm found, and Microsoft is projected to barely top Yahoo this year.Video advertising on the Web generates smaller revenues but has a much higher growth rate, according to eMarketer. While total digital ad revenues are expected to increase 16.7 percent to $140.2 billion in 2014, spending on Web video ads is expected to grow 56 percent to nearly $6 billion.Google is also dominant in Web video ad sales, with its YouTube video service commanding nearly 19 percent of the market, according to eMarketer. Yahoo is hoping to counter the wealth of user-generated videos on Google's service with professional video content produced by stars like Katie Couric.Yahoo certainly has the money for the BrightRoll deal: It sold shares worth about $9 billion in the initial public offering of Chinese e-commerce powerhouse Alibaba, and said it would hold on to about half of the after-tax windfall, with the rest going to shareholders.Yahoo shares dipped 0.7 percent to $49.05 in regular trading Tuesday, and did not appreciably gain in after-hours trading following the BrightRoll acquisition announcement.SV150 market report: Juniper Networks drops, Zynga zoomsThe Dow Jones industrial average and Standard & Poor's 500 closed at record highs for the fifth consecutive day Tuesday, and Silicon Valley tech stocks also clocked slight gains as Juniper sank and Zynga shot higher.Juniper Networks suffered the largest percentage decline in the SV150 on Tuesday, after the Sunnyvale networking company announced the sudden departure of its CEO, the second such change in less than a year. Juniper stock dropped 5.7 percent to $20.28, losing much of the gains realized in the two weeks since now-former-CEO Shaygan Kheradpir gave a well-regarded presentation at the company's analyst day. Analysts said Tuesday that Juniper's replacement, veteran employee Rami Rahim, was a good choice but won't undo the damage cased by Juniper's sudden move. "We have found Rami to be extremely smart and charismatic in our interactions with him over the years, and we think he is a solid CEO choice," MKM Partners analyst Michael Genovese wrote in a note. "Nevertheless, we remain unclear in regards to the real story behind why Juniper brought Shaygan Kheradpir in a year ago from the outside to be CEO but has suddenly changed course."Zynga moved to the other side of the SV150, experiencing the strongest gains of the day among Silicon Valley's largest public tech companies by adding 10.9 percent to $2.75 a share. Investors seemed to be excited by the performance of the latest game from the San Francisco social-gaming pioneer, a new version of the Scrabble-like mobile game "Words With Friends." Jefferies analyst Brian Pitz upgraded the company's stock Tuesday, calling the new game a "legitimate hit" and the third-most downloaded app at the moment. "The game should benefit from strong seasonal trends around holiday ad prices, and strong demand for video ads," Pitz wrote.Apple added 0.8 percent to $109.70 despite facing a lawsuit over missing text messages, as a UBS survey discovered more demand than previously thought for the iPhone 6 Plus. Google gained 0.5 percent to $550.29 while reportedly locking down a key deal for its YouTube streaming-music service and hiring a Zynga executive for its YouTube team. Tesla Motors gave veterans a tour of its Fremont factory to mark Tuesday's Veterans Day holiday, and the Palo Alto company's shares jumped 3.8 percent to $251.08 on the day.Up: Zynga, Yelp, Tesla, Gilead, Intuit, Apple, LinkedInDown: Juniper, SunPower, SolarCity, Netflix, Nvidia, AMD, GoProThe SV150 index of Silicon Valley's largest tech companies: Up 4.57, or 0.28 percent, to 1642.2The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index: Up 8.94, or 0.19 percent, to 4,660.56The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average: Up 1.16, or 0.01 percent, to 17,614.9And the widely watched Standard & Poor's 500 index: Up 1.42, or 0.07 percent, to 2,039.68

Painfully uncool Australian rapper Iggy Azalea became a little bit painfully uncooler in late September, when she decided to buy a Disney princess McMansion in the Valley. And not just in the Valley—in Tarzana. Azalea and her boyfriend, Lakers player Nick Young (aka Swaggy P), bought the six-bedroom, seven-and-three-quarter-bathroom house from pop singer Selena Gomez, reports Variety, and we're being a little too mean, it's really not so bad at all. (However, it is definitely not the "Prettiest House in the Valley," as the listing claimed.) It came with dining room, butler's pantry, wood-burning fireplace, guest suite with separate entrance, a pool, built-in barbecue, fire pit, and a basketball court, all on .83 acres. Gomez bought it in 2011 for $2.175 million; Azalea and Young paid $3.45 million. Gomez is on to a house in Calabasas near her on-again-off-again boyfriend Justin Bieber.

She said her life now has “no freedom at all.”“Whatever you do, everything is interpreted the wrong way and then has to be justified,” Lipnitskaia said. “It’s not life, it’s constant stress.Russian President Vladimir Putin gives Lipnitskaia her gold medal.Photo: AP“I’m a person like everyone else. I try to work on the things people expect of me, but I can’t live up to everyone’s desires and whims.”Lipnitskaia has not won a competition since her Olympic team gold, including finishing a surprise fifth in the individual Olympic event as Russian teammate Adelina Sotnikova won gold.After finishing second at last week’s Cup of China, she called the performance the worst skate of her life and missed the award ceremony. Lipnitskaia said she had been so stressed after an error-strewn free skate that she forgot to attend.“I was very upset after skating the free program poorly,” Lipnitskaia said, adding that she had gone to her hotel room to relax.She said she hurried to the rink after receiving a call from organizers, but was too late to attend the ceremony.The gold was won by Russian teammate Elizaveta Tuktamysheva.Lipnitskaia will next compete at the Trophee Bompard in Bordeaux, a Grand Prix event, starting Nov. 21.
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/astronomers-getting-ready-image-century-135900169.html	Astronomers Are Getting Ready To Take The Image Of The Century And Here's What It Will Look Like	NASA/CXC/M.Weiss An artist's drawing of a black hole named Cygnus X-1. It formed when a large star caved in. This black hole pulls matter from blue star beside it. Researchers studying the universe are ramping up to take the "image of the century" — the first image of a supermassive black hole.Since the 18th century, astronomers have discussed the possibility of exotic objects in space so massive that their gravitational grip swallows everything that dares to get too close, including light. We call these objects black holes, but in truth we do not know what a black hole really is because we've never actually seen one.The evidence for the existence of black holes, however, is compelling:"We have abundant evidence that black holes — or something very much like them — exist," Todd Thompson, astronomy professor at Ohio State University, told Business Insider earlier this year. "This evidence comes from the orbits of stars around the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy."Scientists will continue to argue the contrary until physical, observational evidence is provided.Now, a dedicated team of astrophysicists armed with a global fleet of powerful telescopes is out to change that. If they succeed, they will snap the first picture of the monstrously massive black hole thought to live at the center of our home galaxy, the Milky Way.It will be the "image of the century" according to scientists at the MIT Haystack Observatory, one of the 13 institutes from around the world involved with the project.This ambitious project, called the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), is incredibly tricky, but recent advances in their research are encouraging the team to push forward.EHT needs to be so complex because black holes by definition do not emit light, making them invisible. In fact, black holes survive by gobbling up light and any other matter — nearby dust, gas, and stars — that fall into their powerful clutches.How To Glimpse A Black HoleSo, how do you see something that is invisible? The answer leads us to the most advanced sub-millimeter telescopes in use — telescopes that detect wavelengths of light longer than the human eye can see.The EHT team is going to zoom in on a miniscule spot on the sky toward the center of the Milky Way where they believe to be the event horizon of a supermassive black hole weighing in at 4 million times the mass of our sun.Every black hole has a point of no return, called the event horizon. Once light, or anything else in the universe, passes the event horizon, it never escapes and is swallowed up. Forever.We can still see the material, however, right before it falls into eternal darkness. The EHT team is going to try to glimpse this ring of radiation that outlines the event horizon. Experts call this outline the "shadow" of a black hole, and it's this shadow that the EHT team is ultimately after to prove the existence of black holes.Below is a perfectly clear computer-generated image on the left of what scientists think the shadow will look like, and on the right is what they expect to actually see with the resolving power of today's current technology.Courtesy of Sheperd Doeleman."If we see the shadow, that will be the most powerful evidence we have" that black holes exist, MIT's Shep Doeleman told PBS.A Difficult TaskThis shadow, however, is incredibly small from our perspective.The spot on the sky where the team is looking is the size a grapefruit would appear on the moon, as seen from Earth. The Hubble Space Telescope couldn't even see something this small.That's why the EHT team turned to radio dish telescopes in Hawaii, Arizona, California, Chile, and Spain that, when combined, can resolve details more than 2,000 times finer than Hubble.Recently, other EHT researchers, at the University of Arizona, simulated what our galaxy's central black hole and its shadow should look like, to get a better idea of what they might expect from their observations."That ring of light makes the black hole easier to find than if we were looking for complete blackness," Dimitrios Psaltis, of The University Of Arizona, said in a statement. "These simulations also help us find ways to distinguish this signature from all this swirling plasma around the black hole."As shown in the clip below, the black hole at our galaxy's center is emitting jets of extremely hot plasma in confined columns at opposite ends. These columns are known as jets and have been observed around other objects throughout the universe. The EHT team wants to see beyond these jets, to the event horizon.Using the university's powerful supercomputer, they created a black hole that is even more scientifically accurate than the visually stunning black hole in Christopher Nolan's latest film, "Interstellar.""Our team of four here at the UA can produce visuals of a black hole that are more scientifically accurate in a few seconds," Feryal Ozel, also of The University of Arizona, in the statement. Some of the visuals in "Interstellar" required a special-effects team of 30 and as many as 100 hours for the computers to process.Building The Telescope TeamTo further improve its chances of seeing a black hole's shadow, the EHT team is continuously adding new telescopes to their global network. This is because the sensitivity of their measurements increases with each additional telescope, allowing the team to measure finer and finer detail.The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) — the world's most powerful submillimeter array — is slated to join the EHT project soon, along with additional telescopes in Mexico and the South Pole.Last July, scientists installed the world's most precise atomic clock, costing $250,000, at ALMA's Operations base. The clock will sync ALMA's telescopes to other observatories of the EHT to ensure their recordings are accurate to within milliseconds. In fact, this atomic clock is so precise it will still be accurate to within a second 100 million years from now.ALMA will drastically improve EHT's resolving power:"At a single stroke, it increases the collecting area of the global array by nearly a factor of 10," Doeleman told Business Insider in an email. "[It] forms critical baselines (inter-antenna connections) that are essential fo creating good images of the event horizon."Below is an computer-generated image comparing how the shadow of a black hole in another galaxy, called M87, appears with and without ALMA (and other telescopes that make up the full EHT array.)Courtesy of Sheperd Doeleman. "The Event Horizon Telescope is the first to resolve spatial scales comparable to the size of the event horizon of a black hole," University of California Berkeley astronomer Jason Dexter told Universe Today . "I don't think it's crazy to think we might get an image in the next five years."More From Business InsiderAstronomers Are Getting Ready To Take The Image Of The Century These 3 Images Changed Our Understanding Of The Universe Forever A Quirk Of Gravity Created This Bizarre Blue Ring In The Deep Universe
http://news.yahoo.com/data-point-unbelievably-steep-climb-airasia-crash-source-132236864--finance.html	Data point to 'unbelievably' steep climb before AirAsia crash: source	By Siva GovindasamySURABAYA, Indonesia (Reuters) - Radar data being examined by investigators appeared to show that AirAsia Flight QZ8501 made an "unbelievably" steep climb before it crashed, possibly pushing it beyond the Airbus A320's limits, said a source familiar with the probe's initial findings.The data was transmitted before the aircraft disappeared from the screens of air traffic controllers in Jakarta on Sunday, added the source, who declined to be identified."So far, the numbers taken by the radar are unbelievably high. This rate of climb is very high, too high. It appears to be beyond the performance envelope of the aircraft," he said.The source added that the data on which those assumptions had been made were incomplete. Colleagues and friends of the Indonesian captain on board have described him as an experienced and professional pilot.The preliminary findings sharpen the focus on the role bad weather and the crew's reaction to storms and clouds in the area had to play in the plane's crash into the Java Sea which killed all 162 people on board.Finding the six-year-old plane's cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and flight data recorder (FDR), more commonly known as black boxes, was vital to complement the radar data already available."With the CVR and FDR, we can establish what went on in the cockpit and what was going on with the aircraft. We can conclude if the radar information is accurate," added the source.CLIMBING TOO SLOWLY?At 6.12 a.m. on Sunday, 36 minutes after taking off from Surabaya's Juanda Airport on a flight to Singapore, the pilot asked for permission to climb to 38,000ft from 32,000ft and deviate to the left to avoid bad weather.Two minutes later, Jakarta responded by asking QZ8501 to go left seven miles and climb to 34,000ft. There was no response from the cockpit. The aircraft was still detected by the ATC's radar before disappearing at 6.18 a.m.An image that was reportedly leaked from AirNav Indonesia, which manages the country's air space, and shared on several websites, appeared to show QZ8501 at an altitude of 36,300ft and climbing at a speed of 353 knots.The source declined to confirm if that image was accurate. Officials from AirNav Indonesia declined to comment.Two veteran pilots told Reuters that, if accurate, the image and information released so far pointed to the fact that the aircraft may have climbed suddenly and then lost speed.This can result in the aircraft stalling in mid-air before plunging to the sea, they said.One pilot explained that an A320 would cruise at a speed of around Mach 0.78 while at an altitude of 32,000ft. That translates into roughly 516 knots."If you encounter turbulence, you go slower at what we call the turbulence penetration speed to get through it. If you climb to avoid turbulence, you slow down to have a better climb rate. That could be around Mach 0.76," he said. "But if you climb suddenly and start to lose speed, you will stall."The source close to the probe said other aircraft in the area at the time of the crash were flying at higher altitudes. Aircraft tracking website flightradar24.com said that they were at between 34,000 and 39,000 feet."We know that there was severe local weather and big clouds. But they (the other planes) were higher and did not appear to encounter any major problems. We want to look into that too," added the source.Industry sources told Reuters that there could be parallels between this incident and the crash of Air France flight AF447 in 2009.The investigation into that Airbus A330 showed that the co-pilot lost speed readings due to icing on the airframe.His panic reaction meant that he kept trying to climb despite repeated stall warnings, and the crew failed to recognize the situation, eventually sending the aircraft plunging into the Atlantic.Incidents like these show that the margin for error at higher altitudes is smaller than at takeoff or lower down, say industry experts.They add that the A320's systems usually prevent pilots from doing anything outside usual safe flight parameters. But these protections can be disabled in some circumstances, handing control to the pilots and leaving it to manual flying skills.(Additional reporting by Jane Wardell in SYDNEY and Tim Hepher in PARIS; Editing by Mike Collett-White)
http://entertainment.suntimes.com/lifestyles/dear-abby-december-31-2014-2/	Dear Abby: Teenager 'knocked' up by family friend - Chicago Entertainment - Chicago Sun-Times	Dear Abby: My 16-year-old daughter, “Sierra,” started baby-sitting in the afternoons for a couple when she was 15. Sometimes her dad or I would drop her off; sometimes the husband, “Karl,” would before he left for work. My husband and Karl became friends, and when Karl and his wife split up, we let him stay on our couch for a few months.Then we found out Sierra was pregnant and that she and Karl had been sleeping together before he split with his wife. My daughter is upset that we want to involve the police and press charges because she was underage. How can I get Sierra to stop hating me and understand that this relationship isn’t healthy?— “The Enemy Mom” in South CarolinaDear “Enemy Mom”: Sierra is angry at you because you are injecting an unwelcome note of reality into her fantasy of “love.” Karl is a predator who needs to be answerable for what he did. He will also have to support that child until he or she is no longer a minor. Because he has shown himself to be amoral and irresponsible, involve not only the police but also the department of social services to ensure that he lives up to all of his responsibilities.Dear Abby: It was brought to my attention that an employee in my workplace was asked by his supervisor if he would be OK with working with a gay male before the person was interviewed. Is this even legal? She basically “outed” the potential employee in the workplace.If the person she asked did have a problem working with someone who’s gay, it implies the man wouldn’t have been hired, which would be discrimination, wouldn’t it? Couldn’t that lead to a possible lawsuit? Or am I wrong?— Right or Wrong in WisconsinDear Right or Wrong: I discussed your question with an attorney from Lambda Legal, the national organization committed to achieving full recognition of the civil rights of LGBT people. Currently, 21 states plus the District of Columbia have laws that protect gay people from employment discrimination. Wisconsin is one of them.The attorney said that “outing” the candidate to the other employee was “not necessarily illegal,” but that it was “definitely a bad business practice.”In the 21 states that offer protection for gay people, a prospective employer cannot base a hiring decision on how comfortable someone is with the candidate’s sexual orientation, or the perception that a co-worker or customer might be uncomfortable with a gay person. That is discrimination, and it is illegal.Dear Readers: The year is almost over — I can’t believe how fast it has gone! Please accept my heartfelt wish for a happy, healthy and prosperous 2015.

http://news.yahoo.com/david-gregory-dc-gun-law-magazine-meet-the-press-164519689.html	Judge orders release of David Gregory affidavit after gun display	A federal judge has ordered the District of Columbia to release the affidavit stemming from the Metropolitan Police Department's investigation of David Gregory after the "Meet the Press" host displayed a high-capacity ammunition magazine on the air while taping the program in NBC's Washington, D.C., studio in 2012.William Jacobson, a conservative blogger, filed a Freedom of Information Act suit last year seeking the records after Gregory was not prosecuted despite warnings from D.C. police to producers that the display would be a clear violation of D.C.'s gun laws.Earlier this month, D.C. Superior Court Judge Robert Okun ordered the District of Columbia to produce the affidavit in Gregory's case. The district has until Jan. 7 to comply.Gregory displayed the high-capacity magazine on the Dec. 23, 2012, broadcast during an interview with National Rifle Association chief executive Wayne LaPierre days after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings in Newtown, Conn., where 26 people, including 20 children, were killed."So here is a magazine for ammunition that carries 30 bullets," Gregory said. "Now isn't it possible that, if we got rid of these, if we replaced them and said, 'Well, you could only have a magazine that carries five bullets or 10 bullets,' isn't it just possible that we can reduce the carnage in a situation like Newtown?""I don't believe that's going to make one difference," LaPierre said. "There are so many different ways he could have done it. And there's an endless amount of ways a monster could have done it."View gallery David Gregory displays a high-capacity magazine on "Meet The Press," Dec. 23, 2012. (AP/NBC News)After the interview aired, conservative bloggers wondered if Gregory had broken the law that states, in part, "No person in the District shall possess, sell, or transfer any large capacity ammunition feeding device regardless of whether the device is attached to a firearm."But in January 2013, D.C. Attorney General Irvin D. Nathan informed NBC that Gregory would not be charged with a crime.While the display "meets the definition" of the criminal statute, Nathan wrote in a letter to the network's lawyers, Gregory's prosecution "would not promote public safety in the District of Columbia nor serve the best interests of the people of the District to whom this office owes its trust.""That’s not how the average person is treated in D.C., where the technicalities of the gun laws are enforced with obsessive prosecutorial vigor," Jacobson wrote. "And that’s the point. We never wanted David Gregory prosecuted for violating the ridiculous gun law provision, we wanted public officials to be held accountable for the unequal application of the law."Gregory, who became host of "Meet the Press" in 2008, left the show in August amid declining ratings.Related video:
http://www.voanews.com/content/judge-sentence-pistorius/2490559.html	Pistorius Sentenced, Taken to Prison	Oscar Pistorius has been taken from Pretoria High Court to a nearby prison, where he will begin serving a five-year sentence for fatally shooting his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp.Earlier Tuesday, South African Judge Thokozile Masipa had sentenced Pistorius to five years in prison for Steenkamp's death.The famed South African runner was taken by police van Tuesday to the Kgosi Mampuru Prison, where he will be placed in the hospital wing.Masipa took more than an hour to announce her verdict in Pretoria, in a sentence that is dividing opinion in a nation that has been riveted by his nearly seven-month trial.Pistorius' legal team said after the ruling they expect Pistorius will serve about 10 months in prison before completing his time under house arrest.Under South African law, he must serve at least one-sixth of his sentence - in this case, about 10 months - before he can be considered for parole.10-year sentence soughtProsecutor Gerrie Nel had pushed for a 10-year prison sentence, while the defense argued for house arrest and community service because they felt the double-amputee would face difficulties in prison.Masipa said she is "satisfied" the corrections department is equipped to handle inmates with special needs, and described her verdict as "fair and just, both to society and to the accused.""Hopefully this judgment and sentence shall provide some sort of closure for the family and for all concerned so that they can move on with their lives. There is a delicate balance between the crime, the criminal and the interests of society," Masipa said."The extent of negligence in culpable homicide cases plays an important role in coming to an appropriate sentence which should neither be too severe or too light," she added.Pistorius was immediately whisked to a holding area after sentencing Tuesday.According to adjunct professor Stephen Tuson at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa allows a person sent directly to prison on a sentence of not more than five years to apply for a portion of that time to be converted to house arrest.Culpable homicidePistorius was convicted last month of culpable homicide - roughly equivalent to the American charge of manslaughter - for shooting Steenkamp at his home in February 2013. He said he mistook her for a nighttime intruder and shot her dead through a locked bathroom door because he feared for his life. National Prosecuting Authority spokesman Nathi Mncube would not say whether the state will appeal."Of course, as we have stated before, we are disappointed with the conviction of culpable homicide. We still maintain the same position. We have noted also the sentence that was delivered today," Mncube said."We have not made up our minds whether we are going to appeal it or not.  We are going to ...  go and consider, because it is not a very straightforward matter. There is law that needs to be considered. There is an appetite for the need to appeal, but as I said, we have 14 days to consider," Mncube added.The Olympian faced a more serious charge of murder, but Masipa ruled that prosecutors did not prove he intentionally shot Steenkamp.The judge also gave Pistorius a three-year suspended sentence Tuesday for a firearms charge in the case, which will run concurrently with the sentence for culpable homicide.As during the trial, the families of both Pistorius and Steenkamp were present Tuesday, sitting on benches on opposite sides of the courtroom.Reeva Steenkamp’s mother, June, left the court, indicating to local reporters she thought justice had been served.However, the women's league of the ruling African National Congress, which has been a constant presence alongside Steenkamp's family in court, said in a statement that they are dissatisfied with the result.Women's leagueThe group has protested since the beginning of Pistorius' case and claims Steenkamp's death is yet another case of South Africa's epidemic of domestic abuse. But such claims were never proven in court.Women's League spokeswoman Jacqui Mofokeng said the group is seeking an appeal."We are not happy with the verdict, and we are not happy with the sentence. Because this is sending a very, very wrong message out there," Mofokeng said."We have people with disability, and they have been sentenced before, and it cannot change anything. ... We are not happy with even culpable homicide, that's what we wanted. And when we go for an appeal, we are calling that he gets sentenced to murder. The charge should be murder and nothing else," she said.The trial, which has riveted South Africa, is the first major criminal trial in the country to be broadcast live.Judge Masipa acknowledged the case is unusual and has been affected by Pistorius' international fame, but she said that did not affect her judgment."I might add," she said, "that it would be a sad day for this country if there was one law for the poor and disadvantaged, and another for the rich and famous."Pistorius is known as the "blade runner" for his carbon-fiber prosthetic legs.  He became the first double-amputee to compete in the Olympics when he ran at the 2012 games in London.The International Paralymic Committee said Pistorius would be banned from the Paralymics for his entire five-year jail term.Anita Powell contributed to this report from Pretoria, South Africa.

Remember when Zumba took over the internet in 2012? The ACSM totally predicted that. For 2015, however, the most popular workout is no fitness fad or flash-in-the-pan exercise (hey, remember the Shake Weight?). It’s a tried-and-true workout that you might already be doing.See more: The Top Get-Fit GiftsDrumroll please…. Bodyweight training beat out high-intensity interval training for the top spot. And for good reason: it’s basically a fancy way to describe all the good ol’ moves you’ve been doing since you first went to the gym (think squats, lunges, pushups, planks…). It’s the basics; so why is it so popular? Well, because it’s the most inexpensive workout out there — all you need is your own body weight — and you can do it literally anywhere, no gym required. Bodyweight training didn’t actually appear on ACSM’s survey until 2013 (the first survey was done in 2006), when it debuted at number three, because it only became a “defined trend” during the last few years, according to the study authors.See more: How to Lose Weight and Feel Great in 7 DaysIn case you need a little more excitement at the gym, you should know that HIIT workouts are still ranked at number two, followed by strength training and personal training. Spinning, on the other hand, seems to be on its way out.

http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/physics/earliest-image-universe-4-9-percent-regular-matter/	Image of the Early Universe Is Only 4.9 Percent Regular Matter	In an unfinished Italian palace, surrounded by frescoes that dried some 600 years ago, astronomers revealed their latest piece—a portrait of the universe when it was just 380,000 years old, as captured by the Planck spacecraft.And what a work of art it is. Microwave ripples—their peaks just 0.000075 K hotter than their troughs—texturize the colorful signatures of heat released from galactic dust. It’s in this earliest image that astronomers see the universe for what it was 13.8 billion years ago—a suffocatingly hot place dominated by the dark energy that’s fueling its expansion.Ripples of microwave radiation texturize the heat emissions of galactic dust.Also lurking in the image are regular matter (just 4.9% of what we see) and dark matter (26.6 %). Yet despite those statistics, the Planck team still has no answer to just what dark matter and dark energy are. Here’s Dennis Overbye, reporting for the New York Times:Planck dealt a blow to another possible dark matter candidate, namely a brand of the ghostly particles known as neutrinos. Physicists have known of three types of neutrinos for some time and have wondered if there were any more, whose accumulated mass would affect the evolution of the universe. Planck’s results leave little room for a fourth kind, so-called sterile neutrinos.Though we may not be any closer to discovering what makes up the majority of the universe, astronomers are inching closer to finding the B-mode swirls that would prove the inflationary theory of the universe. Though the BICEP2 team failed in their latest attempt to tease out those polarized microwaves, they have partnered with the Planck team, which has access to a larger number of frequencies. Their combined data set has the potential to be that much more explanatory, and their mutual analysis will be revealed this January. It’s certain to shed even more light on the earliest days of the universe.
http://news.yahoo.com/phoenix-police-officer-shoots-dead-unarmed-black-man-200230314.html	Phoenix police officer shoots dead unarmed black man during scuffle	By Daniel Wallis(Reuters) - A Phoenix police officer shot to death an unarmed black man during a struggle and authorities said the officer believed the individual had a gun, in the latest fatal incident amid national turmoil over the policing of black communities.The Phoenix Police Department said Rumain Brisbon, 34, was sitting in a black Cadillac SUV outside a convenience store on Tuesday evening, and that two witnesses told the officer the occupants of the vehicle were selling drugs.With police forces across the country under increased scrutiny over killings of unarmed black men, Phoenix police said in a statement that its officer called for backup, and then saw Brisbon appear to remove something from the car's back seat.It said the officer, a seven-year veteran of the department, gave him several commands to show his hands, before Brisbon "placed one or both hands in his waistband area" and then fled.The officer chased and caught up with him, it said, and during a struggle the policeman believed he felt the handle of a gun while holding the individual's hand in his pocket."The officer gave the suspect several commands to get on the ground but he refused to comply, yelling profanities at the officer," said the police statement issued on Wednesday.At that point a resident opened an apartment door and both men stumbled into her home, it said, adding that the officer was unable to keep a grip on the suspect's hand."Fearing Brisbon had a gun in his pocket the officer fired two rounds striking Brisbon in the torso," it said.The police department said the back-up officers arrived after the shooting, and while they and members of the fire department treated Brisbon, he was pronounced dead at the scene.Police said Brisbon was carrying a vial of oxycodone pills, and that a semi-automatic handgun and a jar of what is believed to be marijuana were found in the SUV. The 30-year-old officer was not injured during the incident, the statement added.The shooting in Phoenix comes at a tense time between U.S. law enforcement and the communities in which they operate. Two grand jury decisions not to indict officers who killed unarmed black men in Ferguson, Missouri, and in New York City have triggered racially charged protests throughout the United States.(Reporting by Daniel Wallis in Denver; Editing by Mohammad Zargham)
http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/12/6/7342171/trolls-einstein-curie	Einstein's advice to Marie Curie on dealing with trolls: "Don't read that hogwash"	Trolls are not a new problem.Way back in 1911, in fact, Albert Einstein was giving Marie Curie advice on how to deal with them, as astrobiologist David Grinspoon recently discovered in a huge trove of new Einstein letters put online this week.(The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein)At the time, Curie was putting up with a lot of ridiculous criticism. Despite winning a Nobel Prize for her pioneering work on radioactivity, in January 1911, her bid for a seat in the French Academy of Sciences had been rejected, likely in part because she was a woman and atheist, and perhaps also due to rumors that she was Jewish — a problem in an anti-Semitic, Dreyfuss affair-era France.And what Einstein's referring to in this letter is that soon after that, news came out that Curie, a widow, was having an affair with a physicist named Paul Langevin. He was married, but estranged from his wife — but critics said that Curie had tarnished the name of her deceased husband Pierre Curie.In response to all this, Einstein praised Curie's work, and offered some time-tested advice for dealing with trolls. He preferred the evocative term "reptiles," but his succinct advice from a century ago still holds true today: "don't read that hogwash."

According to Fox 43, the youngster played it totally cool while talking to her mom, and explained that the calf just walked in the door while she wasn’t looking. Her mom, however, seemed to know better.So, with the baby cow laying on the floor next to the family’s dog, mom Billie Jo Decker whipped out her phone, and decided to video her daughter’s hilarious/adorable explanation. She then posted the video, and it went viral on Reddit. According to The Huffington Post, Breanna loves her pet “more than cow,” and seemed to be very concerned about the calf, who had a cut on her leg. It’s clear that she loves animals, and that she just wanted the calf inside to keep her company.Kids and animals tend to make super adorable memories together. As previously reported by the Inquisitr, a video of a baby and a sloth went viral last week. You can check that out here.[Photo courtesy of YouTube]

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/stone-cold-steve-austin-does-190000196.html	Stone Cold' Steve Austin Does One Thing On His Podcast That He Never Thought He'd Do	Bryan Bedder/Getty Images "Stone Cold" Steve Austin at a press conference in 2007.When "Stone Cold" Steve Austin first began his professional wrestling career in the late 1980s, the industry had yet to admit to the public that its fights were staged, even if many of its fans had by then caught on to the act.The World Wrestling Federation's "Dr. D." David Schultz famously slapped reporter John Stossel when he asked him if wrestling was "fake" during a 1984 interview for ABC's "20/20" news program, and Austin himself went through his entire training without being told that the winner of his matches would be decided before either wrestler set foot in the ring.Today, things are much different. The WWF is now World Wrestling Entertainment, and the company has for decades referred to its shows as "sports entertainment" in a nod to the fact that they are not competitive athletic events like the amateur wrestling bouts that are on display at the Olympics.But perhaps nothing is as indicative of how much the wrestling business has changed as a new set of special episodes Austin has recently been doing for his podcast, which debuted last year.In them, Austin does a running commentary fans can listen to while watching his classic matches with Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and Bret "The Hitman" Hart, during which six-time WWF champion reveals some of the tricks he used to create the illusion of an actual fight.For instance, Austin explains the technique he used to draw the camera's focus away from The Rock while he was surreptitiously cutting his own forehead open with a razor blade. This way,  it looked to fans watching at home as if The Rock's bleeding was caused by Austin hitting him with a metal bell."If you'd have told me that I'd be doing this back in 1990 when I won rookie of the year [from the prestigious Wrestling Observer Newsletter], I'd have said you were full of crap," Austin tells Business Insider. "That's how far things have changed."Austin says that what he's trying to do in these episodes is strike a balance that allows fans to get an insider's perspective on professional wrestling without revealing too many of the genre's tricks.In his mind, wrestling is just like a movie in that both art forms rely on an audience that is willing to suspend its disbelief.And just like "Inside the Actors Studio" hasn't ruined cinema for film nuts, Austin says his insights won't stop wrestling fans from being able to buy into the action they watch on Monday nights."When you watch Leonardo DiCaprio or Daniel Day-Lewis, or somebody in a badass action movie, you know you're watching a movie and you want to suspend your disbelief. The same thing still is true with pro wrestling or sports entertainment," he says. "I was just able to lift up the veil a little bit and let you see what was going through my head when these matches were going on."More From Business InsiderGrid-Scale Storage: Smooth Operators This Is A Life-Changing Application That Every iPhone 6 Owner Should Download 'Stone Cold' Steve Austin Does One Thing On His Podcast That He Never Thought He'd Do
http://www.vox.com/2014/12/8/7353343/taylor-swift-thirsty	Taylor Swift says the media is #thirsty — here's what she means	Annoyed with rumors that she and her identical twin/best friend Karlie Kloss were lovers, Taylor Swift shot out a scathing tweet Monday morning:As my 25th birthday present from the media, I'd like for you to stop accusing all my friends of dating me. #thirsty — Taylor Swift (@taylorswift13) December 8, 2014The tweet is presumably aimed at Gawker and TMZ who both reported last week that Swift and Kloss were kissing at a concert. That much is clear. But for some (the olds), Swift's hashtag at the end is confusing. Is Taylor Swift thirsty? What do beverages have to do with this? Doesn't Taylor Swift have enough money to afford some water or something?No. Nothing. Yes.1) What is "thirsty"?Thirsty is another way of saying "desperate." Taylor Swift, then, is trying to say that the media is desperate for stories and making up stuff about her and Karlie Kloss. Believe what you want, but Swift is on her sass game this morning.Vox Video Archives: The Economic Benefits of Being Beautiful

http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1126526-evidence-shows-mit-had-cure-for-ebola-back-in-2011/	Evidence Shows MIT Had Cure for Ebola Back in 2011	By Jonathan Benson, contributing writer to Natural NewsA major breakthrough out of MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) shows incredible promise as a cure for virtually every kind of viral infection known to man. But the mainstream media has chosen to stick with hype, fear and, more recently, the ominous threat of martial law when it comes to dealing with alleged viral threats like H1N1 and Ebola.Scientists from the school’s Lincoln Laboratory basically came up with a method of targeting viruses that destroys infected cells while leaving healthy cells unharmed, similar to how antiviral nutrients function. But here’s the kicker: The discovery was made in 2011, three years before the current Ebola outbreak, though it hasn’t received any media attention whatsoever.Published in the journal PLOS ONE, a groundbreaking study on this novel therapeutic explains how existing antiviral medications are scarce, and many of them largely ineffective. Viable treatments for the common cold, for example, are practically nonexistent, while newer diseases like SARS are regarded by public health officials as basically untreatable.“In theory, it should work against all viruses,” stated Todd Rider, a senior staff scientist from the Lincoln Laboratory’s Chemical, Biological and Nanoscale Technologies Group and inventor of the technology, to MIT News.DRACOs Tell Virus-Infected Cells to Kill ThemselvesSo what is this mysterious technological advancement? The paper calls them DRACOs, which is short for Double-stranded RNA Activated Caspase Oligomerizers. In essence, it is a substance that induces apoptosis, or cell death, in cells containing viral dsRNA, the double-stranded RNA produced by viruses for the purpose of replication.Human cells are naturally pre-programmed to create special proteins that destroy these dsRNA strands, but viruses can mutate to outsmart and bypass this safeguard. This is where DRACOs come in, adding an additional protein into the mix that triggers apoptosis in infected cells. This combined approach is not only effective against virtually all tested viruses, but it also eliminates the possibility of viral resistance.“Viruses are pretty good at developing resistance to things we try against them,” stated Karla Kirkegaard, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford University, to MIT News about the development. “[B]ut in this case, it’s hard to think of a simple pathway to drug resistance.”DRACOs Don’t Harm Healthy CellsThe best part about DRACO technology is that it leaves uninfected cells alone, which can’t be said for the array of pharmaceuticals currently on the market, including chemotherapy drugs that kill everything in their path. Tests conducted both in vitro (in a test tube) and in vivo (in living organisms) show that DRACO is capable of killing the H1N1 influenza virus without causing any harm.“DRACOs should be effective against numerous clinical and NIAID priority viruses, due to the broad-spectrum sensitivity of the dsRNA detection domain, the potent activity of the apoptosis induction domain, and the novel direct linkage between the two which viruses have never encountered,” wrote the authors.“We have demonstrated that DRACOs are effective against viruses with DNA, dsRNA, positive-sense ssRNA, and negative-sense ssRNA genomes; enveloped and non-enveloped viruses; viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm and viruses that replicate in the nucleus; human, bat, and rodent viruses; and viruses that use a variety of cellular receptors.”This clearly represents an extensive array of efficacy that is unmatched by any drugs currently on the market, yet DRACOs have received little media attention since they were first announced. Though they obviously require much more extensive testing to ensure safety, DRACOs appear to have taken a back seat to vaccines, which are the only type of intervention that government health officials seem to care about these days.

http://celebrity.yahoo.com/blogs/celeb-news/alyssa-milano-channels-gisele-bundchen-in-breastfeeding-photo-172538326.html	Alyssa Milano Channels Gisele Bündchen in Breastfeeding Photo	View gallery. Alyssa Milano with her daughter (Facebook)Breastfeeding in public isn't necessarily glamorous, but Alyssa Milano sure makes it look that way.Stealing a page from Gisele Bündchen's playbook, the Mistresses alum, who gave birth to daughter Elizabella Dylan Bugliari on Sept. 4, posted a Facebook photo of herself masterfully multitasking, having her glam squad prep her for Marie Claire photo shoot while she breastfed her baby."First day back at work!" wrote the 41-year-old, who is also mom to son Milo, 3. She tagged it, "#blessed."The photo was a re-creation of Bündchen's breastfeeding photo op last year. The supermodel was in the same pose (add in a manicurist), with daughter Vivian. However, everything Tom Brady's wife says or does when it comes to parenting seems to come under fire, so it became "controversial" topic. The photo was dissected on the news (Denise Albert of TheMoms.com said on Good Morning America, "I think breastfeeding is a very personal thing and for her to put this on Instagram while she's getting her hair and makeup done is a little outrageous, and I think obnoxious) and even spoofed, including by Shameless actress Emmy Rossum.View gallery. Gisele Bündchen struck a similar pose last year. (Instagram)Milano didn't run into such criticism for her glam shot. Most of the comments say things like, "Thank you! From, almost all moms everywhere" or simply "beautiful." The former child star has become a bit of a breastfeeding advocate – this is the second photo she's posted on social media showing her feeding her daughter in the last two weeks.Related: Alyssa Milano Shares Intimate Breastfeeding PhotoBündchen aside, celebrity moms revealing this natural part of their lives has become very common. A few months back, Olivia Wilde's Glamour photo shoot included a shot of her feeding her son, Otis. Brad Pitt captured Angelina Jolie feeding one of her twins for W magazine. Stars including Gwen Stefani, Pink, Jaime King, and Miranda Kerr have also shared photos socially.Pretty soon, photos of celebrities feeding their babies will be #NBD - and we'll have to find something else to write about.Follow Suzy Byrne on Twitter
http://yahoo.thepostgame.com/blog/eye-performance/201411/tom-brady-new-england-patriots-nfl-football-sleep	Why Tom Brady Is In Bed By Nine O'Clock	No wonder Tom Brady had such a rough outing earlier this year on Monday Night Football against the Kansas City Chiefs. As it turns out, that game was played well past his bedtime.The game in question, on Sept. 29, started at 8:30 p.m. ET. That, according to New England receiver Julian Edelman, is Brady's bedtime. Brady went 14-for-23 for 159 yards to go along with two interceptions and one touchdown in that loss. Since then the Patriots have won five games in a row and are now all alone in first place in the AFC East (only one of those games, on Oct. 16 against the Jets, was played at night.) In a recent column ESPN's Bill Simmons says Edelman told him that Brady is so adamant about his football longevity that he goes to bed well before people twice his age.Brady confirmed that habit during his weekly radio interview on Boston's WEEI:"I do go to bed very early because I'm up very early," Brady said, according to Business Insider. "I think that the decisions that I make always center around performance enhancement, if that makes sense. So whether that's what I eat or what decisions I make or whether I drink or don't drink, it's always football-centric. I want to be the best I can be every day. I want to be the best I can be every week. I want to be the best I can be for my teammates. I love the game and I want to do it for a long time. But I also know that if I want to do it for a long time, I have to do things differently than the way guys have always done it."Perhaps this is why, at 37, Brady is still one of the best quarterbacks around. Through nine games he's on pace to throw for 4,252 yards and 39 touchdowns.While his sleeping habits may help his productivity, unfortunately for Brady he tends to miss some important events because he's in bed. Two years ago Brady was asked by reporters whether he felt an earthquake that rocked the Northeast. He said he did, and that it happened at 7 p.m., right before he went to sleep."7:15 I was asleep," Brady said. "Trying to get bright-eyed and bushy-tailed."Tom Brady And Gisele BundchenLike us on facebook, follow us on twitter, and subscribe to our YouTube channel.
http://news.yahoo.com/scandinavian-jet-nearly-crashed-russian-warplane-155542744.html	Scandinavian jet 'nearly crashed into Russian warplane'	London (AFP) - A Scandinavian airliner carrying 132 passengers nearly crashed earlier this year into a Russian warplane that was flying covertly, a study of Russia-West military incidents said Monday.Swedish media reported that the two planes came within 90 metres (300 feet) of each other in the air some 50 miles (80 kilometres) southeast of the Swedish city of Malmo on March 3."A collision was apparently avoided thanks only to good visibility and the alertness of the passenger plane pilots," the European Leadership Network (ELN) think-tank's report said.The Scandinavian Airlines Boeing 737 was on its way from Copenhagen to Rome.The Russian reconnaissance plane "did not transmit its position", said the report "Dangerous Brinkmanship: Close Military Encounters Between Russia and the West in 2014".The narrowly avoided incident would have been "comparable to the tragedy of flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine", it said, referring to the downing of the Malaysia Airlines plane on July 17 in which 298 people died.View gallery A Russian warplane flying covertly almost collided with a Swedish passenger plane earlier this year, …The report listed a total of 45 incidents so far this year -- almost all of them linked to air and naval war games in different parts of the world including the Pacific.The SAS incident was classified as "high risk", along with two others: the alleged abduction of an Estonian security service operative by Russian agents from an Estonian border post on September 5 and the reports of "foreign underwater activity" off the Swedish coast last month.The study also counted 11 "serious incidents with escalation risk" including four cases of "harassment" of US and Swedish planes in international airspace by armed Russian fighter jets.Among the 11 were also two cases of Russian aircraft conducting close overflights over Canadian and US ships in the Black Sea and Russian aircraft violating Swedish airspace on a mock "bombing raid" mission and Russian planes conducting a mock attack on the heavily populated Danish island of Bornholm.The Soviet Union's last leader Mikhail Gorbachev on Saturday warned that the world was on the "brink of a new Cold War" at an event to mark 25 years since the Berlin Wall's fall.The crisis in Ukraine has escalated tensions between Russia and the West to their highest level since the end of the Cold War and increased Russian air activity over Europe during the past year has rattled the nerves of NATO alliance members.
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/09/10/scientists-extreme-solar-storm-heading-to-earth/20960634/	Scientists: 'Extreme' solar storm heading to Earth	WASHINGTON (AP) - A strong solar flare is blasting its way to Earth, but the worst of its power looks like it will barely skim above the planet and not cause many problems.It has been several years since Earth has had a solar storm of this size coming from sunspots smack in the middle of the sun, said Tom Berger, director of the Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Colorado. The flare on the sun barely hits the "extreme" on forecasters' scale, but with its worst effects missing Earth it is only looking "potentially strong" at most when it arrives at Earth as a solar storm, he said.New calculations from satellite data show that the worst of the energetic particles streaming from the sun likely will go north or above Earth this time, Berger said late Wednesday.So while the power grid may see fluctuations because the storm will cause changes in Earth's magnetic field, it won't knock power systems off line, Berger said. It may cause slight disturbances in satellites and radio transmissions but nothing major."We're not scared of this one," Berger said.The storm is moving medium fast, about 2.5 million miles per hour, meaning the soonest it could arrive is early Friday. But it could be later, Berger said.Solar storms occur often, especially during peaks in the solar cycle, and don't directly harm people."There's been a giant magnetic explosion on the sun," Berger said. "Because it's pointed right at us, we'll at least catch some of the cloud" of highly energized and magnetized plasma that can disrupt Earth's magnetic sphere, which sometimes leads to temporary power grid problems.On the plus side, sun flares expand the colorful northern lights so people farther south can see them. But don't expect them too far south, Berger said.___Online:Space Weather Prediction Center: http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/index.html
http://news.yahoo.com/russia-may-face-chaos-extra-sanctions-imposed-germany-140023551.html	Russia 'may face chaos' if extra sanctions imposed: Germany	Frankfurt (AFP) - Tougher sanctions may destabilise the situation further in Russia and plunge the country into chaos, German deputy chancellor Sigmar Gabriel warned in a newspaper interview on Sunday."The goal was never to push Russia politically and economically into chaos," Gabriel told the Bild am Sonntag."Whoever wants that will provoke a much more dangerous situation for all of us in Europe," he said, pointing out that Russia was a nuclear power.The aim of the sanctions imposed against Russia so far was to steer the country back to the negotiating table."Those who want to destabilise Russia economically and politically even more are pursuing completely different interests," said Gabriel, who is also Germany's economy minister.Some in Europe and in the United States want to see the old arch-rival Russia on its knees, but Gabriel said: "That is not Germany's or Europe's interest.""We want to help solve the conflict in Ukraine, not to force Russia to its knees," he said.The West has repeatedly accused Russia of stoking the Ukraine crisis, by supplying weapons and troops to the rebels. Moscow denies the charge.Sanctions imposed by the European Union and the United States, along with plunging oil prices, have sent the ruble crashing by some 40 percent against the dollar last year.
http://www.cbsnews.com/news/north-korean-dicatator-kim-jong-un-makes-1st-public-appearance-in-weeks/	North Korean dicatator Kim Jong-un makes 1st public appearance in weeks	An image from a North Korean state television broadcast on Oct. 14, 2014 shows supreme leader Kim Jong Un walking with a cane. AP/KRTSEOUL, South Korea -- North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un has made his first public appearance in five weeks, state media reported Tuesday, ending an absence that drove a frenzy of global speculation that something was amiss with the country's most powerful person.The sudden resumption of the "field guidance" tours that had been a regular part of Kim's public persona before he stopped showing up in media reports for 40 days allowed the country's massive propaganda apparatus to resume doing what it does best -- glorify the third generation of the Kim family to rule -- and will tamp down, at least for the moment, rumors of coups and serious health problems.Kim, shown in the North's leading newspaper smiling and walking with a cane, toured the newly built Wisong Scientists Residential District and another new institute.Play Video CBS Evening News Where is Kim Jong-un? North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un has not been seen in public since attending a concert with his wife on September 3rd. Since little information ...He "took necessary steps with loving care" and vowed to turn the area into a "world-class science city," a dispatch early Tuesday from the official Korean Central News Agency said in typical fawning style. The North didn't say when the visit happened, nor did it address the leader's health.Before Tuesday's dispatch, Kim had last been seen in the media at a Sept. 3 concert.Foreign media had no trouble filling the void that followed. From "Saturday Night Live" spoofs to the wild theories of journalists across the globe trying to parse his growing absence from the public eye, Kim captured nearly as many headlines as he did when he threatened to nuke his enemies last year.This bewildering ability to command attention by doing nothing says a lot about the North's propaganda focus on Kim as the center of everything. Remove for 40 days the sun around which that propaganda spins and the international media, both traditional and social, exploded with curiosity.And while there was plenty of informed analysis from experts and frequent visitors to Pyongyang that said it probably wasn't anything that serious, there seemed to be even more thinly sourced speculation.18 Photos Kim Jong-un Photographs of North Korea's young leaderKim was, by turns, reported to be suffering from gout, from diabetes, from a brain hemorrhage, from a heart ailment, from a leg injury that required surgery from a French doctor, from mental illness or, according to a head-turning British report, from a cheese addiction. There were rumors of coups.The speculation was fed by Kim missing several high-profile events that he normally attends and his description in an official documentary last month as experiencing "discomfort." Archive footage from August showed him overweight and limping.The South Korean government saw no signs to indicate any major problems.At a South Korean parliamentary hearing Monday, Choi Yoon-hee, head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a lawmaker that whatever health problems Kim might have, they "are not severe enough to disrupt his status as the ruler of the country."No unusual troop movements or other signs of a possible coup have emerged. Diplomacy at the highest level has continued: Three members of his inner circle made a surprise visit to the South, something analysts say would be impossible without the leader's blessing. Foreign tourists and aid workers are still traveling to the North, and there have been no reports of new restrictions or warnings for diplomats.There's also nothing particularly unusual about North Korean leaders laying low for extended periods. Kim's grandfather and late father, Kim Jong Il, both took long, unexplained breaks from work, often leading to similar rumors in Seoul and beyond of coups and sudden death. Kim Jong Un, who seems to genuinely like being at the center of things, took off without a word for three weeks in 2012.The recent absence was, in part, "probably an attention-getting device (and it certainly works)," Bruce Cumings, an expert on Korea at the University of Chicago, said in an email. "The North has been on a diplomatic offensive in Europe and elsewhere, it feels isolated - and is, if we're talking about relations with Washington. All this puts them back on the front page."Part of the interest in Kim's absence also stemmed from worries about what would happen to the country if the leader died without securing a succession.Kim Jong Un's two older brothers, for whatever reasons, were deemed unfit to rule by Kim Jong Il, and little is known about his sister.Kim reportedly does have a direct heir who may one day extend the Kim dynasty into a fourth generation. Probably not soon, though. She's believed to be a toddler.
http://www.refinery29.com/2014/12/79063/best-groomsmen-dance-ever	This Groomsmen Dance Is The Best Groomsmen Dance	Some grooms give their brides jewelry or flowers on their wedding day. Not Teddy Forance, nope. The professional dancer and his groomsmen — who just happen to be dancers, too — choreographed and performed an epic dance as a gift to Teddy's wife and it is everything you would want a choreographed groomsmen dance to be.Which is no surprise, because the groom is a member of Shaping Sound, a dance company founded in 2012 by So You Think You Can Dance's Travis Wall, who took second place on the show in season two, and joined in season five as a choreographer. So, if you're planning a major dance routine at your wedding reception, it's probably going to be extra epic if everyone involved is an accomplished professional dancer.The routine starts with a group groove to Michael Jackson and Justin Timberlake's "Love Never Felt so Good," and a lot of cheers from the other guests. Then the bride is picked up in her chair and twirled around the dance floor (without the groom, so they weren't doing a revamped hora). She's gently set back down on the sidelines before — and this is where it slays — indoor fireworks explode behind the dancers and the place goes nuts. Pure wedding magic.The video ends with the groom kneeling in front of his beautiful bride for a serious make-out sesh. (Note to self, date some hot dancers in next life.)If you want to see Teddy and the guys get down in person, Shaping Sound tours nationally. You can find dates here.

http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/06/28/the-world-was-533-years-of-oil-left/11528999/	The world has 53.3 years of oil left	BP (ticker BP ) has provided an intriguing update to its global oil reserves estimate in the company's latest yearly review of energy statistics. BP raised its reserve estimate by 1.1% to 1,687.9 billion barrels, which is enough oil to last the world 53.3 years at the current production rates. However, there's likely a lot more oil left in the tank beyond what BP sees today.America's energy boom surgesA good portion of the growth in global oil reserves in BP's report comes from the United States. According to BP, the U.S. has 44.2 billion barrels of oil reserves, which is 26% higher than it previously thought. It's also quite a bit more optimistic than the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which recently increased its estimate to 33.4 billion barrels of reserves, or 15% more than previously thought.The overall cause for that surge in oil reserves is that America's shale oil plays -- the Bakken, Eagle Ford and Permian Basin -- are now being unlocked through horizontal drilling technology.Despite the big boost in reserves over the past year, there appears to be much more oil potential in each shale play, with the Permian Basin really standing out.As that slide points out, Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE: PXD ) now estimates the Spraberry/Wolfcamp shale formations in the Permian Basin contain 75 billion barrels of recoverable oil and gas. That number is actually a major upward revision from last year when Pioneer estimated the two formations held 50 billion barrels of recoverable oil and gas.These Permian Basin plays now make the Eagle Ford and Bakken shales look small in comparison. Yet the recoverable reserve estimates of both of those shale plays also continue to grow. In the four years since EOG Resources (NYSE: EOG ) began developing the Eagle Ford shale it has drastically revised its reserve estimates. The company now believes it will recover 3.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent on its land position, which is up from less than 1 billion barrels in 2010. New technologies and techniques, including closer spacing of wells, are providing a big boost to future reserve estimates.Next up for AmericaAs those three plays do all the current heavy lifting to grow reserves, new oil plays continue to emerge. The two most promising appear to be the Tuscaloosa Marine shale in the Gulf Coast region and several shale plays in the Rockies. EOG Resources this year unveiled four new horizontal oil discoveries in the Rockies, proving yet again that America's energy boom is just getting started.EOG Resources estimates that it will ultimately recover about 400 million barrels of oil equivalent as it develops its acreage in the Rockies. However, keeping in mind the company's nearly fourfold boost to its estimated recovery figure in the Eagle Ford shale, it's likely there is a lot more upside in the Rockies as EOG Resources and others develop the oil rich shales in the region.Investor takeawayWhile the world as BP sees it might just hold 53.3 years' worth of oil, that certainly does not mean we'll run out of oil anytime soon. New shale plays continue to be discovered in the U.S., which should fuel substantial gains in reserves over the next decade. There's plenty of oil still left in the world's tank thanks to the development of America's shale resources.The Motley Fool is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news, analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives.

http://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2014/12/15/7394705/andrew-luck-trash-talk-nfl-colts-eagles	Andrew Luck is the NFL's weirdest trash talker	Nobody trash talks like Andrew Luck, nobody. The Colts quarterback has been employing a new method to get inside the heads of his opponents, and it's working. The Wall Street Journal caught up with a few players who've been on the receiving end of his compliments.Luck has become famous for congratulating-sincerely and enthusiastically-any player to hit him hard. Any sack is met with a hearty congratulations, such as "great job" or "what a hit!" He yells it after hard hits that don't result in sacks, too. It is, players say, just about the weirdest thing any quarterback does in the NFL.This is some next-level psychological warfare stuff going on, and it's working. Eagles safety Nolan Carroll was incensed by Luck's "trash" talking.Carroll was walking back to the huddle when he heard "Great job, Nolan!" He turned around, searching for the person who said it-maybe it was a teammate, he thought. "Then I realized it was Luck who said it. I'm like ‘what's going on? Aren't you supposed to be mad?'" Carroll said. "So then I'm the one who gets ticked off because an upbeat attitude isn't something you see."Where is this going to end? Are defenders going to sack Luck and now start complimenting him for how well he stood in the pocket? This could be a nicety arms-race in the NFL, and that would be amazing.

http://www.inquisitr.com/1701333/father-faces-felony-assault-charges-for-spanking-his-six-year-old-son/	Father Faces Felony Assault Charges For Spanking His 6-Year-Old Son	A father from Queensbury, New York, faces felony assault charges, after spanking his 6-year-old son last weekend. Jeffrey Lamphear, 39, allegedly hit his child on the buttocks. According to Lamphear, he was disciplining his son. He told the police that is is possible that he spanked his child harder than he thought he did, but asserts the child was only spanked, and that the spanking was done as punishment.The authorities were notified when the child’s mother discovered bruising and welts on the child’s buttock. According to WNYT News, the child’s mother took her son to the emergency room, when she saw the marks on her son’s buttocks. There were no marks elsewhere on the child’s body, according to the most updated report. The police say the boy did not sustain serious injuries.As well as facing felony assault charges, Lamphear has been ordered to stay away from his child. According to social media discussion, Lamphear is being both condemned and supported for the way he disciplined his child.“Definitely not applauding him, however, some kids bruise easy. I know me and my kids do. He looks like a big man so he probably did spank a little harder than he should have however, I wasn’t there, can’t judge,” Rachel Thomas-Baker from New York wrote.“This story is ridiculous! Felony I think not. Spanking a child is up to the parent not the cops or our legal system. Sounds like the mom is out for revenge on her former lover. If he does not have a record and this is the first time and the child has no other welts or black and blue marks case closed. He’s 6 I’m sure he can tell what’s going on,” Cas Pearsall wrote.“This is what often happens with corporal punishment. People get carried away in their own anger. The answer? Stop using it. There are better, more effective ways to discipline (teach) a child right from wrong. The only thing hitting teaches is hitting and fear,” Betsy Williams Briggs wrote.New York penal code Section 35.10 does not generally consider spankings by a parent illegal. Physical force used upon a child is legally justified, according to New York law, if a parent is disciplining a child and provided that it is not deadly force. The parent must also reasonably believe that the extent of the punishment is needed to maintain discipline.“A parent, guardian or other person entrusted with the care and supervision of a person under the age of twenty-one or an incompetent person, and a teacher or other person entrusted with the care and supervision of a person under the age of twenty-one for a special purpose, may use physical force, but not deadly physical force, upon such person when and to the extent that he reasonably believes it necessary to maintain discipline or to promote the welfare of such person.”Legislation has been discussed in New York that would restrict the kind of physical force a parent would legally be permitted to use.“Currently the penal law allows the use of physical force, other than deadly force, to be used by a parent, guardian or teacher to the extent that he reasonably believes it necessary to maintain discipline,” the penal code amendment proposal explained in bill S266-2011.More recent legislation was written to change the wording of the law such that physical force would be allowed “except if such physical force leads to significant physical or emotional harm constituting an offense upon such person.” So far, the code remains on the books the same was it has been written since the 70s.What do you think? Should this father face felony assault charges and be restricted from seeing his son for spanking him and leaving bruises and welts on his buttocks? [Photo via Warren County Sheriff]
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/02/28/doctors-warn-extreme-workouts-have-dangerous-side-effects/20840409/	Doctors Warn Extreme Workouts Have Dangerous Side Effects	Next time you're pushing for one more rep in the gym, it might be better to just stop. Doctors across the country are arguing the popular CrossFit workout could do more harm than good.The cross-training program urges exercisers to go harder and faster, all while pushing through their limits. But going too far with these strenuous drills could cause a condition called rhabdomyolysis. (Via ABC)"Rhabdo," for short, causes muscle cells to literally explode, flooding blood vessels with their contents and in extreme cases, causing kidney failure. One woman said it was more painful than childbirth. (Via WebMD)"I've had two babies...and I'd have 5 more before I ever had to go through this again."And Dr. Ron Goldin says only experienced trainers should try CrossFit."If you haven't worked out for a while, don't jump into it, trying to keep up with the rest of the class and don't try to do the hardest workout you've ever done." (Via WPTV)The condition is on the rise as CrossFit grows increasingly popular, with over 6,000 affiliated gyms in the United States. That's up from only 50 in 2005. (Via The New York Times)But the regimen has its fair share of critics. A columnist for The Huffington Post scolds the CrossFit culture as "one of pushing your body to the point of near exhaustion. It is a system of punishing exercises built on a platform of peer pressure."Even converts admit the gym climate can be a bit much."Some people refer to folks doing CrossFit as crazy and some people even call it a cult." (Via WTTG)Critics have even tried advancing their cause by creating "Uncle Rhabdo," a clown mascot suffering from the muscle disease. (Via Breaking Muscle)But other Crossfit trainers say rhabdo is just the result of irresponsible workouts. According to one participant, the disease is "an extreme condition thwarted upon oneself... It's not the sport, the organization or even the coaches. It's your own fault."Overall, doctors agree that the intensive workouts are healthy... in moderation. It's key to listen to your body and avoid pushing too hard.

http://www.salon.com/2015/01/03/god_is_on_the_ropes_the_brilliant_new_science_that_has_creationists_and_the_christian_right_terrified/	God is on the ropes: The brilliant new science that has creationists and the Christian right terrified	The Christian right’s obsessive hatred of Darwin is a wonder to behold, but it could someday be rivaled by the hatred of someone you’ve probably never even heard of. Darwin earned their hatred because he explained the evolution of life in a way that doesn’t require the hand of God. Darwin didn’t exclude God, of course, though many creationists seem incapable of grasping this point. But he didn’t require God, either, and that was enough to drive some people mad.Darwin also didn’t have anything to say about how life got started in the first place — which still leaves a mighty big role for God to play, for those who are so inclined. But that could be about to change, and things could get a whole lot worse for creationists because of Jeremy England, a young MIT professor who’s proposed a theory, based in thermodynamics, showing that the emergence of life was not accidental, but necessary. “[U]nder certain conditions, matter inexorably acquires the key physical attribute associated with life,” he was quoted as saying in an article in Quanta magazine early in 2014, that’s since been republished by Scientific American and, more recently, by Business Insider. In essence, he’s saying, life itself evolved out of simpler non-living systems.The notion of an evolutionary process broader than life itself is not entirely new. Indeed, there’s evidence, recounted by Eric Havelock in “The Liberal Temper in Greek Politics,” that it was held by the pre-Socratic natural philosophers, who also first gave us the concept of the atom, among many other things. But unlike them or other earlier precursors, England has a specific, unifying, testable evolutionary mechanism in mind.Quanta fleshed things out a bit more like this:From the standpoint of physics, there is one essential difference between living things and inanimate clumps of carbon atoms: The former tend to be much better at capturing energy from their environment and dissipating that energy as heat. Jeremy England, a 31-year-old assistant professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has derived a mathematical formula that he believes explains this capacity. The formula, based on established physics, indicates that when a group of atoms is driven by an external source of energy (like the sun or chemical fuel) and surrounded by a heat bath (like the ocean or atmosphere), it will often gradually restructure itself in order to dissipate increasingly more energy. This could mean that under certain conditions, matter inexorably acquires the key physical attribute associated with life.
http://news.yahoo.com/executed-100-foreigners-trying-quit-report-140040461.html	IS has executed 100 foreigners trying to quit: report	London (AFP) - The Islamic State extremist group has executed 100 of its own foreign fighters who tried to flee their headquarters in the Syrian city of Raqqa, the Financial Times newspaper said Saturday.An activist opposed to both IS and the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who is well-known to the British business broadsheet, said he had "verified 100 executions" of foreign IS fighters trying to leave the jihadist group's de facto capital.IS fighters in Raqqa said the group has created a military police to clamp down on foreign fighters who do not report for duty. Dozens of homes have been raided and many jihadists have been arrested, the FT reported.Some jihadists have become disillusioned with the realities of fighting in Syria, reports have said.According to the British press in October, five Britons, three French, two Germans and two Belgians wanted to return home after complaining that they ended up fighting against other rebel groups rather than Assad's regime. They were being held prisoner by IS.In total, between 30 and 50 Britons want to return but fear they face jail, according to researchers at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King's College London, which had been contacted by one of the jihadists speaking on their behalf.View gallery This undated file image posted on a militant website on Jan. 14, 2014, which has been verified and i …Since a US-led coalition began a campaign of air strikes against IS in August, the extremist group has lost ground to local forces and seen the number of its fighters killed rise significantly.There have been a string of apparent setbacks for IS in recent weeks.Iraqi Kurds claimed Thursday to have broken a siege on a mountain where Yazidi civilians and fighters have long been trapped.The Kurdish advances came during a two-day blitz in the Sinjar region involving 8,000 peshmerga fighters and some of the heaviest air strikes since a US-led coalition started an air campaign four months ago.Meanwhile Thursday, the Pentagon said several IS leaders had been killed in US air strikes.In 40 days across October and November, some 2,000 air raids killed more than 500 people, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitoring group, which relies on a network of sources on the ground.
https://www.yahoo.com/tech/s/most-beautiful-iphone-6-cases-ve-never-heard-161014440.html	The most beautiful iPhone 6 cases you’ve never heard of	The most beautiful iPhone 6 cases you’ve never heard ofBig companies like Apple spend millions of dollars on smartphone designs. Research and development costs add up fast, and countless man-hours are devoted to perfecting every internal component, every material and every curve of a handset’s housing. People buy these modern marvels for hundreds of dollars and fawn over their sleek lines and smooth curves, openly adoring them online and in person with friends.Then, they cover these amazing smartphones with $2 worth of atrocious, glossy hard plastic.FROM EARLIER: 10 cases that will protect your iPhone 6 without ruining Apple’s gorgeous designRegular BGR readers know that I am not a fan of smartphone cases. With Apple’s iPhones in particular, it’s practically a crime against good taste to slap a case on these gorgeous devices.But with the iPhone 6, that all changed.Forgetting that the devices themselves feature some curious design decisions that some owners might actually want to cover up, there has never been a more slippery iPhone than the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. These phones are accidents waiting to happen, and for the first time, I feel that I have no choice but to cover these sleek smartphones with protective cases.But just because cases are a necessity with the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, that doesn’t mean you have to use a cheap ugly case.I recent penned a post about 10 cases that protect the iPhone 6 without making it look awful, and it ended up being wildly popular. People know they need to protect these slippery smartphones, but they don’t want to ruin the look of the phones in the process.Since I ran that post, about 30 different case makers have contacted be looking for coverage for their iPhone cases. We don’t often cover smartphone cases here on BGR, as you well know, so most of their requests went ignored. A handful of companies make cases that truly are worthy of your attnetion though, and I’ll try to feature them here on the site from time to time.One such company is Alto.To look at Alto’s gorgeous leather iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus cases, one would think this company is based in Italy or elsewhere in Europe. While Alto does indeed use Italian leather, it is actually a small company based in Taiwan.I have been testing four of Alto’s cases over the past week or so, and I am genuinely impressed with the look and quality of these cases.The leather on Alto’s cases is smooth and supple, but it’s also remarkably thin so it barely adds any bulk to the iPhone’s housing. Of course, Apple’s new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are so thin that case makers have some extra room to play with their designs, but Alto didn’t need it.These cases add just a few millimeters of thickness to the back of Apple’s handsets. Then the cases wrap around the sides of the phone and sit almost flush with the display, so no thickness is added to the face of the phones.Since Alto uses real Italian leather on its cases, they act like any other genuine leather. They change over time, darkening from oils that are transferred from hands and scuffing from rubs and scrapes. This adds character that no synthetic material will ever achieve, and it makes every case unique.The leather is real and the craftsmanship is quite impressive, so these cases are not cheap. Prices range from $55 for leather and coated denim iPhone 6 cases to $68 for all-leather iPhone 6 Plus cases. You also have to pay for shipping from Taiwan, which starts at $17 to the United States.

Psaki said yesterday the troop movements, if confirmed, would violate a cease-fire pact agreed in September.Asked if Russia still respected the cease-fire, Lavrov said: “The cease-fire has been signed between the rebels and the government. It’s for them to finalize the disengagement line, which they are doing right now.”Ukraine’s military said yesterday it killed as many as 200 rebels near the eastern city of Donetsk. Both sides have accused each other of breaking the truce agreed to in Belarus on Sept. 5. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said his country isn’t militarily involved.Rising tension between the former Soviet republics is threatening to escalate back into the open separatist war that broke out after the February ouster of Russian-backed president Viktor Yanukovych and Putin’s annexation of the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine a month later.To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Nicole Gaouette in Beijing at ngaouette@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Rosalind Mathieson at rmathieson3@bloomberg.net; Nicholas Wadhams at nwadhams@bloomberg.net Nicholas Wadhams

http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-29932609	Planet formation captured in photo	A protoplanetary disc has formed around the young star HL TauThe clearest ever image of planets forming around an infant star has been taken by the Alma radio telescope.In a vast disc of dust and gas, dark rings are clearly visible: gaps in the cloud, swept clear by brand new planets in orbit.The sun-like star at the centre, HL Tau, is less than a million years old and is 450 light years from Earth in the constellation Taurus.The image was made possible by Alma's new high-resolution capabilities.Because the process of planet formation takes place in the midst of such a huge dust cloud, it can't be observed using visible light.Alma, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, has snapped the impressive new image using much longer wavelengths, which it detects by comparing the signal from multiple antennas up to 15km apart.To test out its latest high-resolution capability, only in operation since September, Alma scientists pointed the antennas at HL Tau. They found themselves looking at a "protoplanetary disc" in more detail than ever before."When we first saw this image we were astounded at the spectacular level of detail," said Dr Catherine Vlahakis, a senior member of the Alma team."HL Tau is no more than a million years old, yet already its disc appears to be full of forming planets."Prof Tim de Zeeuw is director general of the European Southern Observatory, one of several organisations involved in Alma. He said: "Most of what we know about planet formation today is based on theory. Images with this level of detail have up to now been relegated to computer simulations or artist's impressions."The antennas that make up Alma are separated by up to 15km, high in Chile's Atacama DesertDr Aprajita Verma, an astrophysicist at the University of Oxford, said the picture was "phenomenal"."This shows how exciting Alma is going to be - it's going to be an incredible instrument."She said the new data was especially interesting because the star HL Tau is very young."I think the big result is that you might have expected just a smooth disc," Dr Verma told the BBC."But you're really seeing multiple rings - and where it's darker, that's where you've cleared the material already in the disc."The whole process is happening faster than we would have predicted from existing data, Dr Verma explained."It means that things are coagulating. It's really a planetary system, that you're seeing at a very early time."These rings will form planets, asteroids, comets... And eventually as the star evolves, this will cool and settle and there will be more clearing and more individual objects, just like we see in our solar system."Follow Jonathan on TwitterThe image matches predictions from computer simulations and illustrations like this one
http://gawker.com/google-has-become-alphabet-this-means-virtually-nothin-1723230985	Google Has Become Alphabet; This Means Virtually Nothing For You	Google announced Monday that it’s now part of a new umbrella company called Alphabet, which will separate its core internet businesses (still called Google) from Google execs’ various side projects (like trying to live forever, building self-driving cars controlling everything in your home).Officially, the reason is that Google’s many tentacles became too diverse and difficult to manage, and organizing under Alphabet will give them more independence. Google just—as The New York Times notes—pulled a Berkshire Hathaway, adopting the holding company model Warren Buffet uses for his assorted, unrelated businesses. But the Times implies another motivation for Alphabet: appeasing investors who think Google has lost focus on its core business (which is not search—it’s advertising).“We liked the name Alphabet because it means a collection of letters that represent language, one of humanity’s most important innovations, and is the core of how we index with Google search,” wrote Larry Page, co-founder of Google and one of the chiefs, along with Sergey Brin, of Alphabet.“Alphabet” functions as a tidy metaphor for the company that mediates (and monetizes) nearly everything we do on the web, though. As former Gawker EIC Max Read pointed out, Google is positioning itself as the Alpha and the Omega, some kind of internet god whose control over our experience the name “Google” is too small and silly to encompass.Nice, comforting thought for a Monday.The new CEO of Google, a subsidiary of Alphabet, will be Sundar Pichai, who’s been in charge of Chrome OS and Android for some time.[abc.xyz]

Yet it is found so deep down below the surface410 to 1615 milesthat its never been seen before. Those depths are so volatile that even if we could dig down there, the samples would be destroyed before they could be studied. Now scientists have finally succeed in getting a glimpse of this stuff, which they just named bridgmanite (you cant name a mineral until youve actually observed the thing). And they did it by a circuitous routethey looked for it in meteors. RELATED: 4 Rare Earth Elements That Will Only Get More Important. Specifically, they dug into shocked meteors, which are formed under spurts of intense pressure, such as when one asteroid slams into another. This makes the meteors a sort of microcosm of Earth, and a way for scientists to see what kind of minerals form under high pressures like those inside our planet. We still dont know how bridgmanite behaves within the lower mantle of Earth. But at least the mineral made of magnesium, silicon, and oxygen finally has been positively identified and given a name.

http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2014/11/30/7312145/rams-players-hands-up-dont-shoot-police	St. Louis Police Officers Association criticizes Rams players for 'Hands up Don't Shoot' gesture	An organization representing St. Louis police officers is taking issue with a group of Rams players who made the "hands up, don't shoot" gesture prior to Sunday's game.The St. Louis Police Officers Association is calling for a group of players from the St. Louis Rams to face disciplinary action for making the "hands up, don't shoot" gesture, a sign of support for the Ferguson community, during player introductions prior to Sunday's game at the Edward Jones Dome in St. Louis. The group issued a statement Sunday evening that also demanded an apology from the NFL."I know that there are those that will say that these players are simply exercising their First Amendment rights," Jeff Roorda, the group's business manager, said in a statement. "Well I've got news for people who think that way, cops have first amendment rights too, and we plan to exercise ours. I'd remind the NFL and their players that it is not the violent thugs burning down buildings that buy their advertiser's products. It's cops and the good people of St. Louis and other NFL towns that do. Somebody needs to throw a flag on this play. If it's not the NFL and the Rams, then it'll be cops and their supporters."Tavon Austin, Stedman Bailey, Kenny Britt, Jared Cook and Chris Givens walked onto the field with their hands in the air. It's become a familiar sight among demonstrators since the shooting of Michael Brown by a Ferguson, Mo., police officer in August."The SLPOA is calling for the players involved to be disciplined and for the Rams and the NFL to deliver a very public apology. Roorda said he planned to speak to the NFL and the Rams to voice his organization's displeasure tomorrow," the statement read.After the game, the players explained that their motivations were benevolent, meant as a sign of support for the larger community and the need for healing."We just understand that it's a big tragedy and we hope something positive comes out of it," Bailey said."We kind of came collectively together and decided we wanted to do something," Cook told Nick Wagoner of ESPN. "So we wanted to come out and show our respect to the protests and the people who have been doing a heck of a job around the world.""We wanted to show that we are organized for a great cause and something positive comes out of it," Britt said to Wagoner after the game. "That's what we hope we can make happen. That's our community. We wanted to let the community know that we support the community."Protesters massed outside the Dome on Sunday, but there were no reports of trouble with the crowds. Rams security and the local police were stationed in and around the building to prevent any serious disruption. The team thanked local police after the game.The Rams -- whose headquarters are roughly 15 minutes from Ferguson -- have extended their support to the community in the months since Brown's death. Earlier this fall, they let the high school football team use their practice facilities while the schools were closed during the unrest. They showed public service announcements with a unity theme, more small gestures that the local police organization didn't take issue with.The SLPOA includes quotes from Roorda, the group's business manager, who led a fundraising effort on behalf of Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Brown. A career law enforcement official, Roorda was fired from the Arnold, Mo., police department in 2001 for filing false reports and making unauthorized recordings of conversations with his superiors.Here's the full statement from the SLPOA via KSDK:St. Louis, Missouri (November 30, 2014) - The St. Louis Police Officers Association is profoundly disappointed with the members of the St. Louis Rams football team who chose to ignore the mountains of evidence released from the St. Louis County Grand Jury this week and engage in a display that police officers around the nation found tasteless, offensive and inflammatory.Five members of the Rams entered the field today exhibiting the "hands-up-don't-shoot" pose that has been adopted by protestors who accused Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson of murdering Michael Brown. The gesture has become synonymous with assertions that Michael Brown was innocent of any wrongdoing and attempting to surrender peacefully when Wilson, according to some now-discredited witnesses, gunned him down in cold blood.SLPOA Business Manager Jeff Roorda said, "now that the evidence is in and Officer Wilson's account has been verified by physical and ballistic evidence as well as eye-witness testimony, which led the grand jury to conclude that no probable cause existed that Wilson engaged in any wrongdoing, it is unthinkable that hometown athletes would so publicly perpetuate a narrative that has been disproven over-and-over again."Roorda was incensed that the Rams and the NFL would tolerate such behavior and called it remarkably hypocritical. "All week long, the Rams and the NFL were on the phone with the St. Louis Police Department asking for assurances that the players and the fans would be kept safe from the violent protesters who had rioted, looted, and burned buildings in Ferguson. Our officers have been working 12 hour shifts for over a week, they had days off including Thanksgiving cancelled so that they could defend this community from those on the streets that perpetuate this myth that Michael Brown was executed by a brother police officer and then, as the players and their fans sit safely in their dome under the watchful protection of hundreds of St. Louis's finest, they take to the turf to call a now-exonerated officer a murderer, that is way out-of-bounds, to put it in football parlance," Roorda said.The SLPOA is calling for the players involved to be disciplined and for the Rams and the NFL to deliver a very public apology. Roorda said he planned to speak to the NFL and the Rams to voice his organization's displeasure tomorrow. He also plans to reach out to other police organizations in St. Louis and around the country to enlist their input on what the appropriate response from law enforcement should be. Roorda warned, "I know that there are those that will say that these players are simply exercising their First Amendment rights. Well I've got news for people who think that way, cops have first amendment rights too, and we plan to exercise ours. I'd remind the NFL and their players that it is not the violent thugs burning down buildings that buy their advertiser's products. It's cops and the good people of St. Louis and other NFL towns that do. Somebody needs to throw a flag on this play. If it's not the NFL and the Rams, then it'll be cops and their supporters."

The fighter who kicks ass, takes names and thumbs his nose at authority will always draw the sort of fans who live vicariously through their antihero.But when the fighter stops kicking ass, things can take an ugly turn.Such was the case this week for UFC lightweight Nate Diaz. Coming off a self-imposed, year-long exile in protest of his pay rate, the Stockton, Calif., native had a train wreck of a return, one that was capped with a one-sided decision loss to Rafael dos Anjos at UFC on FOX 13 in Phoenix.Diaz first raised eyebrows Wednesday, when he missed a public workout session, although that's not unprecedented for either Nate or older brother Nick.Thursday, Nate vented his frustrations in an interview with MMAFighting.com. He ripped on the UFC's recent signing of former pro wrestler CM Punk ("[Expletive] him and [expletive] his situation") and the UFC's announcement of an apparel deal with Reebok, which will replace independent fighter sponsorships ("They're going to make us all look the same, like we're in a cult").View gallery. Rafael dos Anjos battered Nate Diaz with kicks throughout their fight Saturday. (USAT)On Friday, Diaz weighed in for his fight at 160.6 pounds, more than four pounds over the allowable limit for non-championship lightweight bouts, and as such forfeited 20 percent of his fight purse.Had Diaz gone out and scored an impressive win after his wild chain of events, he would have cemented his anti-authoritarian, cult-hero status. Instead, he had a miserable night in the cage against dos Anjos. Dos Anjos brutalized Diaz with leg kicks, to the point the doctor was called in during the second round to check out Diaz's legs. Diaz was never able to get any offense going.While he was tough enough to survive the onslaught and go the distance, he was on the wrong end of two 30-26 scores and a 30-27. It marked Diaz's third loss in his past four fights.It's not too difficult to understand the source of Diaz's continuing frustration. He's a part of the "Skrap Pack." the famed crew of Cesar Gracie-trained fighters along with Nick Diaz and former Strikeforce champions Gilbert Melendez and Jake Shields.The younger Diaz looks around at his team and sees how his big brother scored a huge payday in a big-drawing fight against Georges St-Pierre in 2013, took a year off, and once again figures to score big when he meets Anderson Silva on Jan. 31. Melendez, meanwhile, played his free-agent period correct earlier this year, fielded a contract offer from Bellator, and used his leverage to score a title fight and pay-per-view points in his UFC return against Anthony Pettis last week.Nate Diaz isn't making the same money as his brother and his buddy, but nor has he earned it, either in the cage or as a drawing card. And now he's at a crossroads. He might be unhappy in the UFC, but after Bellator drew a monster television rating for their Tito Ortiz-Stephan Bonnar bout on Nov. 15, the UFC is likely going to think twice about releasing fighters who still retain name value, even if their peak has passed.But on the other hand, dos Anjos aptly demonstrated on Saturday night what can happen in the UFC to a fighter, even one as talented as Diaz, who doesn't have his head in the game.View gallery. Rafael dos Anjos hits Nate Diaz during their fight Saturday. (USAT)For his part, Diaz remained defiant enough to keep the admiration of his most hardcore followers. In the fight's closing seconds, he threw open-hand slaps from the bottom at dos Anjos, which only earned Diaz one final, violent flurry of dos Anjos strikes in response. Diaz promptly got up off the mat after the horn sounded and delivered a double-middle-fingered salute to the audience.Later in the evening, Diaz had a rambling interview on FOX Sports 1 in which he referred to training-camp issues and an injury, neither of which he cared to elaborate on."I don't want to make excuses," Diaz said. "I hurt myself. I'm going to fight always. I have to get paid. You know? I have a life to pay for, I have to eat.""I'm not like these other guys who pull out of fights due to little baby injuries, you know?" he continued. "The other fighters are breaking hands and little baby toes and pulling out of every fight. I've been injured for 10-15 fights, but regardless of what happens is, I'm going to show and do what I can do. I wish I had a little more to work with this time around, but I came with what I had and I wish I could have got more done."Even later, Diaz posted a picture of an apparent lit marijuana cigarette to his Instagram account. It was a fitting coda to a roller coaster week. And it led his boss, UFC president Dana White, to question whether fighting is something Nate Diaz really wants to do anymore."He wants to make more money, yet he keeps doing things to make himself lose money, which doesn't make sense to me at all," White said at Saturday's postfight news conference. "I think Nate is in this position where he needs to go home, heal up and decide what he wants to do. Does he want to get serious and come in here and try to take a run? Or does he want to retire?"Follow Dave Doyle on Twitter: @DaveDoyleMMA

Protocol prohibits anyone from touching any members of the royal family in pictures.The incident did not appear to concern the Duchess, she smiled in the picture and went on her way, and James is hardly the first American to commit the gaffe.First lady Michelle Obama put her arm around Queen Elizabeth during a 2011 meeting, according to The Telegraph.The royal couple's visit to Barclays concluded the second of a whirlwind three-day tour of New York and Washington, D.C.William's trip saw him even ride a commuter airline from New York to the nation's capital and Kate spent part of Monday visiting schools in the New York.The heir to the British throne and his wife raised a few eyebrows by carrying their own umbrellas in driving rain Tuesday morning while walking to the 9/11 Memorial in Lower Manhattan.They signed the digital guest book "Catherine" and "William."Information from the Associated Press was used in this article
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/05/24/thai-coup-leaders-summon-academics-journalists/20892047/	Thai coup leaders summon academics, journalists	By TODD PITMAN and THANYARAT DOKSONEAssociated PressBANGKOK (AP) -- In a chilling move apparently aimed at neutralizing critics and potential opposition, Thailand's new army junta on Saturday ordered dozens of outspoken activists, academics and journalists to surrender themselves to military authorities.The junta, which is already holding most of the government it ousted in a coup Thursday in secret locations against their will, said it would keep former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra and others in custody for up to a week to give them "time to think" and keep the country calm.Two days after the army seized power in the nation's first coup in eight years, it also faced scattered protests that came amid growing concern over the junta's intentions. Also Saturday, the military dissolved the Senate - the last functioning democratic institution left, and absorbed its legislative powers."Military rule has thrown Thailand's rights situation into a free fall," said Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. "The army is using draconian martial law powers to detain politicians, activists and journalists, to censor media, and to ban all public gatherings. This rolling crackdown needs to come to an end immediately."At least 100 people, mostly top politicians, have been detained incommunicado so far. Deputy army spokesman Col. Weerachon Sukondhapatipak said they were all being well-treated and the military's aim was to achieve a political compromise.Weerachon said all those held have had their cellphones confiscated because "we don't want them communicating with other people. We want them to be themselves and think on their own.""This is because everybody involved in the conflict needs to calm down and have time to think," Weerachon said. "We don't intend to limit their freedom - it's to relieve the pressure."In a military order broadcast at the start of the day, the junta summoned 35 more people, including politicians, political activists and, for the first time, outspoken academics and some journalists.One of those on the list, Kyoto University professor of Southeast Asian studies Pavin Chachavalpongpun, said by telephone from Japan that he would not turn himself in. He said the summons meant the junta felt insecure."The military claiming to be a mediator in the Thai conflict, that is all just nonsense," said Pavin, who is frequently quoted by foreign media as an analyst. "This is not about paving the way for reform and democratization. We are really going back to the crudest form of authoritarianism."In the evening, the junta broadcast its sixth official order, for a single journalist: Pravit Rojanaphruk, an outspoken columnist for the English-language daily The Nation, who was summoned to report to the army at 10 a.m. Sunday. In a tweet Saturday night, Pravit was defiant, saying "the more they exercise their illegitimate power the more illegitimate they become."The junta also ordered banks to freeze the assets of two top politicians it had summoned but who remain in hiding, including the ousted education minister and the chief of the former ruling party.Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha, who leads the junta, has justified the coup by saying the army had to act to avert violence and end half a year of political turmoil triggered by anti-government protests that killed 28 people and injured more than 800.The intractable divide plaguing Thailand today is part of an increasingly precarious power struggle between an elite, conservative minority backed by powerful businessmen and staunch royalists based in Bangkok and the south that can no longer win elections, and the political machine of exiled former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and his supporters in the rural north who backed him because of populist policies such as virtually free health care.The army deposed Thaksin in a 2006 coup. And on Friday, it detained his sister, Yingluck, who was forced from office earlier this month by a controversial court verdict for abuse of power, which she denies.The ruling party, which rose to power in a landslide election in 2011 that was deemed fair, had insisted for months that Thailand's fragile democracy was under attack from protesters, the courts and, finally, the army which together had rendered it powerless, step by step.Although Thailand has been calm since the coup and there is little military presence on the streets, small-scale protests against the junta have been reported in the northern city of Chiang Mai and the beach resort city of Pattaya, south of Bangkok.In the capital, life largely went on as normal. But hundreds of anti-coup protesters took to the streets for a second straight day, defying an army-imposed edict banning groups larger than five from gathering for political purposes. They shouted slogans demanding a return to civilian rule and waved signs outside a cinema complex before moving on to Victory Monument, a major city landmark several kilometers (miles) away.The demonstrators briefly confronted rows of soldiers and police lined up with riot shields on a road leading to the monument, with a few scuffles breaking out before most of the protesters broke away. By late afternoon, about 500 demonstrators had gathered at the moment. Army and police presence was low key, and the groups dispersed before a 10 p.m. curfew came into effect.Several demonstrators have been detained, and rights groups have expressed concern over the growing repression."This is a dangerous precedent - people simply expressing opinions must not be penalized," said Richard Bennett, Amnesty International's Asia Pacific Director. "The need for the military to exercise restraint is particularly crucial given that demonstrations calling for civilian rule could intensify."The army launched the coup after ordering two days of brief peace talks in which the country's political rivals failed to end their deadlock. Anti-government protesters had been calling for the army to intervene and support their bid to overthrow the government, which they accused of corruption, since November.Multiple nations have condemned the coup. The U.S. State Department urged "the immediate restoration of civilian rule and release of detained political leaders, a return to democracy through early elections, and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms."Washington also said it had canceled ongoing military exercises, and a firearms training program for the Thai police. Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said U.S. law and "our own democratic principles" require the U.S. to reconsider its long military relationship with the Southeast Asian country.The Pentagon is also canceling the June visit of U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Admiral Harry Harris to Thailand and is withdrawing the invitation to the commander general of the Royal Thai Armed Forces to visit U.S. Pacific Command in June, Kirby said.Underscoring the challenges facing Thailand's new rulers, police on Saturday said suspected Islamic insurgents detonated at least nine bombs in the country's restive south, killing two people and wounding at least 52. Pattani provincial police chief Phote Suaisuwan said the blasts hit four 7-11 convenience stores, two gasoline stations and three other locations.It was unlikely that the blasts were related to the coup, though insurgents may have been emboldened by the dramatic development. More than 5,000 people have been killed since the insurgency flared in 2004 in Thailand's predominantly Muslim south.---Associated Press writers Kay Johnson, Grant Peck and Jocelyn Gecker contributed to this report.
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/12/09/mars-mountain-may-have-formed-from-big-wet-lake/21005190/	Mars mountain may have formed from big, wet lake	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) - NASA's Curiosity rover is helping scientists close in on a Martian mystery: Why does a mountain jut out of a barren crater?Scientists said Monday that rock images indicate that 3-mile-high Mount Sharp may have formed in a big lake bed over a million or even tens of millions of years. Deposits of sediment seem to have shaped the mountain.That begs the question as to whether microbial life may have existed there in those wet ancient times."This lake was large enough, it could have lasted millions of years - sufficient time for life to get started and thrive, sufficient time for lake sediment to build up to form Mount Sharp," said Michael Meyer, lead scientist of NASA's Mars exploration program.Curiosity's latest observations could mean Mars' warm, wet period occurred about 3.5 billion years ago, more recent than had been thought.In addition, Martian lakes could have lasted longer than previously suspected. Scientists are uncertain whether this wet period was continuous or interrupted by dry spells.Meyer acknowledged that even here on Earth, "we don't have a very good handle" on how long it takes life to originate and how long a conducive environment needs to be in place beforehand. So addressing the possibility of whether life once existed on other planets is made all the more complicated.Curiosity has been exploring Gale Crater since its arrival on Mars two years ago; the rover reached the base of Mount Sharp a few months ago. The crater, 96 miles across, was caused by an asteroid impact.

There will always be clothes to iron and dishes to wash, but also fleeting moments of childhood passing by, and never enough time in the day to accomplish everything on your to-do list. STORY: Learn From This Mother’s Tragic Car Seat MistakeStressing out over finding that perfect balance is nothing new. A recent Care.com survey revealed that one in four working moms cry by themselves at least once a week due to household-related stress.One busy father tackled the topic in a poignant New York Times essay called “Please Forgive My Spotless Home.” David McGlynn writes about being “wracked with guilt” for blowing off his two sons to clean their house.“An entire weekend had slipped by and we had barely looked each other in the eye until the moment I had spurned Galen’s invitation to join him outside,” he laments. “Our exchange on the staircase was the closest we had come to a conversation all weekend, and I had screamed at him.” (In the end, McGlynn says that his son forgives him, reminding all parents that a mistake we make one day can usually be fixed.)STORY: Two Women Breastfeed This BabyIt’s tough to keep your life in order while being an engaged parent, though. Amy McCready, author of If I Have to Tell You One More Time, says there are a few easy ways to make it a little easier.Find ways to incorporate fun into daily chores: “Get your children involved in every day activities such as cooking, so you can also spend time together. Even preschoolers can tear lettuce or set the table.” McCready tells Yahoo Parenting. Lots of parents position play kitchens in or near the dining area so cooking and playing go hand-in-hand. You can easily take sips of soup your child is ‘cooking,’ while the chicken roasts in the oven. Or, while folding laundry, ask kids to match socks or use their superhero muscles to pull sheets and blankets off the bed. Schedule playtime:  Many kids can tell the difference between housework and real playing, but one way to separate the two is to schedule quality time in 15 to 20-minute chunks. That way, your child won’t feel like they’re competing (with your phone, work emails or vacuum cleaner) for attention. Also: You don’t have to curate homemade activities all the time. Watch a movie, visit a golf course, or go sight-seeing. Don’t try to do it all: Select one night a week to order food delivery. While you wait for the pizza to arrive, suggest a card game or fire up the Wii. And rest assured that ordering in isn’t a cop-out. In fact, McCready challenges the Pinterest-perfect world that we live in where everything looks, tastes, and smells pristine. “We all need to be more realistic,” she says.

That’s the question AT&T would like to ask city leaders in Chanute, Kansas, a small town of roughly 9,000 people that is petitioning the state to allow it to offer greater access to the high-speed fiber network that it built to support town utility operations.RELATED: The FCC wants states to stop killing municipal fiber networks that put AT&T to shameThe Wichita Eagle reports that AT&T is concerned about this development and “filed to officially intervene in the case and was granted that permission on Tuesday morning” this week.“Any decision made by the KCC could impact AT&T’s business operations in the area, which is why we asked to intervene in the proceeding,” AT&T told The Eagle. “AT&T remains interested in both broadband issues and the work of the KCC.”It’s true that a 1Gbps fiber service would definitely impact AT&T’s business operations in the area and likely for the very worse. Ars Technica points out that Chanute would charge citizens just $40 per month for its 1Gbps service, which is a mere $5 more than the six-month teaser rate for AT&T’s 6Mbps service. What’s more, AT&T’s plan includes a hard data cap of 150GB per month and going over that limit will set you back by an additional $10 per month.Despite AT&T’s interference, Chanute officials don’t think the state will do anything to block their plan, which has already survived a major challenge after activists beat back legislation that would have all but crippled towns’ ability to build their own fiber networks. What’s more, AT&T says that it hasn’t taken an official position on the fiber network and is simply seeking out more information on why the town might be interested in building such a network and how it might impact AT&T’s own DSL business.More from BGR: 7 awesome paid iPhone and iPad apps that are free for a limited timeThis article was originally published on BGR.com

http://www.aol.com/article/2014/12/03/cricketer-phillip-hughes-laid-to-rest-in-hometown/21002003/	Cricketer Phillip Hughes laid to rest in hometown	MACKSVILLE, Australia (AP) - The funeral for cricketer Phillip Hughes turned into a celebration of his life on Wednesday despite the grief and sorrow still evident from his death.Australia captain Michael Clarke and the rest of the test squad were joined by former and current players from around the world, and friends and relatives from Hughes' hometown of 2,500 people on the northern coast of New South Wales state, 575 kilometers (350 miles north of Sydney).Clarke was a pallbearer and spoke at the funeral service held at the Macksville Recreation Centre and which opened to the song "Forever Young" by Youth Group.The service closed with Elton John's "Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me," the same song the famous entertainer and avid cricket fan performed at a concert last weekend in Germany in tribute to Hughes.Hughes died last Thursday, aged 25, after being hit near the ear by a ball during a match between South Australia and his former state side New South Wales at the Sydney Cricket Ground. His 26th birthday would have been Sunday.In steaming temperatures of nearly 30 Celsius (85F) early arrivals to the service, including Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, fanned themselves with papers. Most of those who wore sports jackets and blazers had taken them off, some with sleeves of their white shirts rolled up to their elbows.At the front of the hall, near the altar for the Roman Catholic service, was Hughes' oak brown casket. Flowers and cricket bats, one with his test cap on the handle, were nearby.Leading the service, which included a video tribute, Father Michael Alcock remembered the batsman as a "shining light.""In his short time he walked as a child of the light, not in an ostentatious way but in a natural, unassuming and passionate way," the priest said.Jason Hughes, Phillip's older brother, said his sibling was "destined to be a rock star.""I couldn't have asked for a better little brother," Hughes said as his parents Greg and Virginia wept in the front row of the congregation.Clarke, who has described Hughes as the brother he never had, broke down frequently last weekend at the SCG when he first commented on his close friend's death.On Wednesday, he took several deep breaths before he began his remarks at the funeral, saying Hughes would "definitely call me a sook right now.""I don't know about you, but I keep looking for him," Clarke said. "I want to see his face pop up around the corner.After Clarke and the other pallbearers placed Hughes' casket in the hearse for a procession through the town, he put his hands on his hips, later wiping tears from his eyes.India's stand-in captain Virat Kohli, team director Ravi Shastri and former Australian wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist walked down the aisle together, part of a large group following the casket out of the hall.Sean Abbott, the 22-year-old who bowled the delivery which fatally injured Hughes, was at the funeral. He was consoled by members of Hughes' family, and Clarke earlier said Abbott should not be held responsible.The family had asked for Hughes' hearse to go through the town's streets to give locals a chance to take part in the service. The kilometer-long procession ended in the center of town, where the hearse took Hughes' coffin to a private service, and Australia's cricketers plus family and friends were to hold a wake.The funeral was telecast live around Australia and on video screens at the Adelaide Oval, where the rescheduled first test with India will start next Tuesday, and the SCG, where a row of 63 bats were propped up against pickets, each with an inscription of a special moment of Hughes' career.Owners of many shops and businesses shut down to attend the funeral, and schoolchildren were let out of their classes early Wednesday to watch or attend the service.In Macksville, Hughes' cousin Nino Ramunno spoke at length about Hughes' youth in Macksville as a keen, budding cricketer. One, who, if he lost a toss to determine who bats at the beginning of a match, kept suggesting it would be a best of three, five, or seven, or longer, until he won it.Ramunno ended his remarks with a saying he said he received from a family friend, in reference to Hughes: "He who lives in the hearts of so many, never dies."
https://www.yahoo.com/tech/the-5-worst-video-games-of-2014-105998039504.html	The 5 Worst Video Games of 2014	It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.Actually, when it comes to these five games, it was just the worst of times.What happened? No one really sets out to make a terrible game. But bad design, buggy graphics, and broken gameplay happen anyway, and they happened in a big way to the following thumb-crushing disasters.1. Dungeon Keeper (iOS) For 50 gems, I’ll tell you why Dungeon Keeper, the penny-pinching mobile remake of a beloved 17-year-old strategy game, is bad news. You can get five gems for 10 gold coins, by the way, and if you click here you can buy packs of gold coins for $4.99 apiece. Or you could just go play the game, though you’ll need some Red Jewels if you want to take more than five turns per day. Those cost 12 gems apiece. Remember when you could just download and play a video game? By the way, that memory costs 100 Black Pearls. Do you have your credit card handy?Related: The 20 Best Games of 20142. Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric (Wii U) Pity poor Sonic. Instead of letting the overworked mascot enjoy his retirement, Sega keeps sticking him in bad games. This year they really outdid themselves. His latest disaster, Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric, is part of an all-out media blitz that includes a TV show, comics, a toy line, and, yep, games. Spreading yourself thin is never a great way to make a good video game, and Rise of Lyric, with its broken, buggy platforming, repetitive action, and irritating characters, is not a good video game.3. SoulCalibur: Lost Swords (PS3) The swords aren’t the only things Bandai Namco lost while making this lousy fighter. They also lost the point of SoulCalibur, one of the greatest fighting franchises ever, by shamelessly converting it into a microtransaction-heavy, free-to-play mess with massive load times and zero multiplayer. Our souls are weeping.4. Rambo: The Video Game (Xbox 360, PS3, PC) Remember Ikari Warriors? It was an old-school coin-op game that had a cool little rotating joystick and two-player support and pretty much let you rampage around as a wannabe Rambo. This new game is totally different, mostly in that it’s terrible. Presumably funded via tickets won at a skee-ball machine, this unstable shooter takes you through “memorable” scenes from the three Rambo films by gluing you to a rail and making you blast anything that moves. We’d be angry too, Rambo.5. Escape Dead Island (Xbox 60, PS3, PC) Challenge accepted! Although really, we’d just like to escape playing this brain-dead zombie game. It’s infested with bugs, for one thing, though worse is the game’s combo of boring action and impossibly steep difficulty. Actually, the interminable fetch quests are worse. No, wait, the glitchy graphics. We can’t decide. Escape!Follow Ben right here on Twitter.

The pair, who have been married for nearly 10 years and have three children together, were pictured joking around and giggling as they enjoyed some one-on-one time. Catalog models, anyone?"You can't expect to be courted all the time, and I don't want to court him right now –- I don't have the energy!" Garner recently told InStyle about keeping the romance alive. "But we're definitely in a very mindful place where we're making an effort to be together, do things at the same time, and be loving."Swoon.
http://news.yahoo.com/lady-gaga-reveals-rape-teenager-011414223.html	Lady Gaga reveals rape as teenager	New York (AFP) - Lady Gaga has revealed that she was raped as a teenager and said that it took her years of therapy to acknowledge and start to recover from the trauma."I don't want to be defined by it," the pop star said. "I'll be damned if somebody is going to say that every creatively intelligent thing I ever did is all boiled down to one dickhead that did that to me."Lady Gaga, 28, said that the rape took place when she was 19 and that she has gone through years of therapy. She did not go into detail but said that the aggressor was 20 years older than her."It happens every day. It's really scary and it's sad and it didn't affect me as much right after as it did about four or five years later," she told radio host Howard Stern."I didn't tell anybody -- I didn't even tell myself for the longest time," she said. "Then I was like, you know what, all this drinking and all this nonsense, you have to go to the source, otherwise it won't go away."The singer, who later became known for her gaudy outfits and outspoken social commentary, said that she did not report the rape. She said she saw her aggressor once more when she ran into him at a store and that she became "paralyzed by fear."Lady Gaga revealed the rape as she discussed her song "Swine" from her 2013 album "Artpop." She performed the song at this year's South by Southwest festival, where she rode a mechanical bull in a suggestive fashion and had a collaborator vomit on her."The song is about rape. This song is about demoralisation," Lady Gaga said in her radio interview Tuesday."I want this chick to throw up on me in front of the world, so that I can tell them, you know what? You could never, ever degrade me as much as I could degrade myself and look how beautiful it is what I do."Related Video
http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/29/ebola-zmapp-success-monkeys/14793487/	Experimental Ebola drug cured 100% of monkeys tested	In what scientists are calling a "monumental achievement," an experimental medication called ZMapp — given on a compassionate basis to a handful of Ebola victims in the current outbreak — cured 100% of monkeys treated in a Canadian study, researchers announced Friday.ZMapp, made by Mapp Biopharmaceuticals of San Diego, is in the early stage of development and has never been formally tested in humans. In a study published Friday in the journal Nature, however, the drug allowed all 18 rhesus macaques infected with a lethal dose of Ebola to recover. The drug worked even when given five days after infection. The monkeys received three doses of ZMapp, administered three days apart, according to the study, which was conducted by the Public Health Agency of Canada.The three monkeys that did not receive ZMapp died within eight days of infection.In monkeys given ZMapp, however, the drug reversed severe symptoms, including severe bleeding, rashes and elevated liver enzymes, a sign of liver failure. Three weeks after infection, tests showed the surviving animals had no detectable Ebola virus in their blood."It's fantastic news," says study co-author Gary Kobinger of the Public Health Agency of Canada. "This strongly supports" the hope that ZMapp will work in humans, he says.The results are "a monumental achievement," says Ebola researcher Thomas Geisbert of the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, who was not involved in the current study but who wrote an accompanying editorial.Doctors used a different strain of Ebola virus in their study than the one that's currently circulating in West Africa. However, they tested ZMapp in test tubes against the current strain and found that it blocked infection.Although ZMapp hasn't been tested for safety in humans, its manufacturer shared a handful of doses with Ebola victims as a last-ditch effort to save their lives. Four of those patients — including two Americans and two Liberian health workers — survived after taking the drug. A fifth aid worker, who is now being treated in London, also has begun treatment with ZMapp. A Spanish priest and Liberian doctor given ZMapp died.Mapp Biopharmaceuticals has said that there are no more doses of ZMapp left. The drug, which includes three man-made antibodies to Ebola, takes months to manufacture. The antibodies are intended to allow the patients' immune system to respond to Ebola and fight off the infection.Given the limited experience with ZMapp in humans, it's not yet possible to know how ZMapp works in humans, Geisbert says.That's because ZMapp has been given to only a handful of patients, with no control group for comparison, he says.The Americans' cases are also unique. One of the American doctors who received ZMapp, Kent Brantly, also received a blood transfusion from a teenager who survived Ebola. So it's possible that the transfusion, not ZMapp, should get credit for saving him, Geisbert says. Receiving intensive care at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta — one of the best hospitals in the world — also could have helped the Americans survive.Geisbert notes that about half of Ebola patients survive without taking ZMapp.It's possible that the two Ebola patients who died after taking ZMapp got the drug too late, Geisbert says. There is a "point of no return," he says, after which time nothing can save someone with Ebola, which causes tiny leaks in blood vessels, leading to massive internal and external bleeding, as well as organ failure. The immune system also can overreact in the late stages of Ebola, causing more harm than good.Three of the five species of Ebola virus are lethal to humans, Geisbert notes. A treatment that works against one species — or different strains of the same species — may not necessarily work against others.Ebola has infected more than 3,000 people in Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Nigeria and Senegal, killing half of them, according to the World Health Organization. Senegal reported its first case of Ebola on Friday.In a worrying development, researchers reported Thursday in Science that the Zaire strain of Ebola virus — the type now circulating in West Africa — appears to have mutated from its original form. The virus appears to be changing as it moves across Africa. Kobinger says he doesn't know how those mutations will affect the efficacy of ZMapp.Doctors at the National Institutes of Health plan to launch the first human trial of an Ebola vaccine next week at the institute's campus in Bethesda, Md., using healthy volunteers. The early study, using just 20 volunteers, will assess the experimental vaccine's safety and ability to activate the immune system to recognize the Ebola virus.Additional vaccine studies will be conducted in Bethesda, the United Kingdom and West Africa throughout the fall, NIH officials said Thursday. Early results from the first NIH trial are expected before the end of the year.Five experimental vaccines under development have been shown to completely protect monkeys against Ebola, Geisbert says. But only one of those vaccines is effective in a single injection — as opposed to multiple shots — an important practical advantage when trying to vaccinate hundreds or thousands of people in developing nations.Getting a usable treatment or vaccine could take many more months, however, officials caution. The best way to control the current outbreak is with traditional measures: diagnosing patients, isolating them, tracing their contacts and testing them, and extending the process out in circles, until all exposed patients have been isolated.Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1pql3dU
http://news.yahoo.com/feuding-neighbor-over-fence-gets-hand-194256560--abc-news-topstories.html	When Feuding With Your Neighbor Over a Fence Gets Out of Hand	Here’s the situation:In the Wildwood neighborhood of San Antonio, Texas, police have responded to the homes of neighbors Yolanda Martinez and Rick Dominguez roughly 140 times.“We’ve been back and forth to those residences over and over and over again,” police Chief Bill McManus told ABC News’ “20/20.”Except for an incident that resulted in Rick Dominguez being charged with an assault -- he later pleaded no contest -- McManus says the feuding neighbors aren’t breaking the law. And though McManus’ officers report the Dominguez family members are the main antagonists, he said there is blame on both sides.Trouble Online:At one time, the Martinez and Dominguez families were close and spent time at each other’s homes. Rick Dominguez even attended the wedding of Yolanda Martinez’s daughter, and the families were friendly on Facebook.About two years ago, the Dominguez family posted on Facebook how they were getting into juicing and living a healthier lifestyle. The two families disagree on what happened next, but there's no doubt there were unfriendly Facebook comments posted, which helped end their friendship.Today, there is a huge barricade between them, a roughly four-foot-tall wooden and latticework fence Yolanda Martinez's husband Tony Martinez constructed, and about 12 feet of corrugated metal on top of wood Rick Dominguez built. In addition, there are cameras everywhere pointing back and both, some put up by the Martinez family and nearly 20 for the Dominguez's.The Martinez Family’s Side of the Story:Yolanda Martinez said the fences were just the beginning. “They started painting pictures of pigs on the walls,” Yolanda Martinez told “20/20.” “[I thought] that they were calling us pigs.”She said Rick Dominguez would harass her family as soon as they walked out of the house by making pig noises, and she claims at one point that he even put a banner in his backyard showing a pig in a simulated sex act with an obscene message directed at them.The Dominguez Family’s Side of the Story:Rick Dominguez said he has proof that whatever he is doing is a response to what Yolanda Martinez and her family next door have done to him.He said he’s seen Tony Martinez repeatedly knock down garbage cans using what he is convinced is a cattle prod. The pig references he’s made, Dominguez said, are nothing more than him getting back at people for provoking him with a farming implement.And the banner showing a pig in a simulated sex act, according to Dominguez, is because the Martinezs had used a 13-foot high camera to invade their privacy. The banner was not visible otherwise, he claims.A Solution?Each side says the other is lying, but paperwork is now flying in both directions. The Dominguez’s and the Martinez’s sued each other. A judge’s injunction orders both families to stop everything, and a city agency is demanding Dominguez tear down his beloved metal borderline once and for all.As for the rest of the residents in the neighborhood, they say the feud is ruining their peace and quiet, not to mention their property values.The only thing the Martinez’s and the Dominguez’s do agree on is that it may take one family to move to finally end it all. But they would both prefer it to be the other family who leaves.Watch the full story on ABC News' "20/20" on Friday, Jan. 2 at 10 p.m. ET.

http://www.inquisitr.com/1703955/jessa-duggar-envious-of-sister-jills-house-19-kids-and-counting-feud-supposedly-rages-on/	Jessa Duggar Envious of Sister Jill’s House: ’19 Kids And Counting’ Feud Supposedly Rages On	Jessa Duggar and Jill Duggar’s family feud still isn’t over, according to a recent report.Reports on the sisters’ supposed dislike for one another first started surfacing after it was discovered that Jill wasn’t following Jessa on Twitter, and rumors of their sibling rivalry have spiraled out of control ever since. Now OK! Magazine is claiming that one of the 19 Kids and Counting stars’ many supposed spats involves their living arrangements.According to the magazine’s source, Jessa Duggar is envious of the fancy house that Jill and husband Derick Dillard are living in. Jessa allegedly thinks it’s unfair that she and Ben Seewald have to live in a “secondhand house.”“She’s used to Jill getting pampered. It doesn’t faze her at this point.”It’s easy to see why Jessa Duggar would be jealous of her sister’s abode — Jim Bob Duggar gifted his second-oldest daughter with a $1.5 million, four-bedroom home after her June wedding (Jim Bob owned the property because he failed to flip it). Jessa’s wedding gift wasn’t quite as generous — she and Ben Seewald are currently occupying the “tiny tract home” where Josh Duggar and his wife Anna used to live. According to the Duggar Family Blog, it’s a two-bedroom, 960-square-foot cottage.Jim Bob allegedly gifted Jill and Derick Dillard with the larger, 4,000-square-foot home because the 19 Kids and Counting patriarch believes that the couple will “fill that house with babies.” Perhaps he doesn’t think Jessa Duggar is as interested in producing grandkids as her sister is.It’s also possible that Jessa believes she would have been given the larger home if she had married first — there had to be some reason she was in a rush to beat her sister to the altar.According to Radar Online, a source told OK! that Jessa and Ben Seewald were not happy that Jill and Derick Dillard got married first. They started dating months before Jill and Derick did, so they felt that they should have wed before the Dillards. Jessa Duggar was allegedly irritated by all the attention that her sister received when she got married.“Jessa is envious that Jill was the first Duggar daughter to get married.”Jessa Duggar also felt like Jill stole her thunder when she got pregnant so soon after getting married — her wedding had to share the spotlight with Jill’s pregnancy. Because of this, the OK! source claims that all Jessa wants for Christmas is a positive pregnancy test (but would she really want to take the attention away from Jesus on his birthday?).There’s a very good chance that these sister feud rumors aren’t true at all. As the Inquisitr previously reported, the sisters and their husbands have actually gone on a double date together since the rumors started. Jessa also didn’t leave Jill out of her holiday greeting on Instagram.Jessa might bear Jill no ill will, but you can see evidence of the 22-year-old being treated like a second-class Duggar in the video below — the other adults get to relax on comfy couches while Jessa and Ben Seewald have to sit on hard piano benches off in the corner (but at least they didn’t get quarantined off in the mailroom like poor Jana).Do you think Jill and Jessa Duggar are really feuding, or are stories of their sibling rivalry just fairy tales?[Images via: Duggar Family Facebook, Jessa Duggar/Instagram]
http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2014/12/26/daring-to-dream.html	Surgeon removes girl’s ‘inoperable’ brain tumor	Erika and James Decker made peace with the knowledge that cancer lived within their daughter’s brain.They weathered its unpredictability and managed to craft days of beauty and laughter even when Lily spent the past year enduring chemo that did no good.The Lewis Center family has known since Lily was 4 about the tumor lurking in the middle of her brain, framed by vital structures and growing, then stalling, then growing again from the size of a pea to the size of a walnut.An inoperable tumor. No one ever said otherwise, not here or elsewhere, when the family sought several opinions.That changed in early November, when Nationwide Children’s Hospital’s new chief of neurosurgery looked at Lily’s scans and met with her and her family. He told them that he could remove the tumor that had grown for a year and now threatened to harm 10-year-old Lily’s mind.About Lily’s mind: It is nimble, sometimes frantic, always kind and often funny, sometimes wickedly so. She’s a kid who says things like, “Nobody’s getting out of here alive.”This girl who loves turtles and art and forcing boys to dance is the reason that James, 46, and Erika, 44, haven’t fallen into despair or allowed themselves to think too long about the future and what might be absent from that picture.“Look at Lily ... she’s the one who wakes up every day with a joke,” Erika said on the night before Lily’s surgery this week as she played near the tree with gifts she’d already opened because Christmas morning would be spent at Children’s.Erika told her the potter’s wheel would have to wait until the new year, but Lily already had an idea about her first project. Her 16-year-old brother, Andrew, had requested a mug.“I’m going to put world’s best brother on it,” she said, pausing to allow her audience to react to her sweetness before delivering the punch line. “Because he’s my only brother!”Lily didn’t have much to say about her surgery the next morning, except this: “Mom, tell them what the doctor said! Tell them what he said!”The chief of neurosurgery at Children’s told Lily to call him Jeff.“He’s awesome,” she said.Jeff is Dr. Jeffrey Leonard, who came to Columbus this spring from St. Louis Children’s Hospital.On Tuesday morning, the Deckers drove before sunrise to Nationwide Children’s. The medical team wheeled Lily into surgery at 8:30 a.m. and the Deckers waited, hearts and minds racing, for the better part of the day.The sun had set before Leonard and his team finished the tedious work of extracting the tumor, bit by bit, taking care to protect a fifth-grader’s ability to remember new math lessons.In the late afternoon, they took a look with an MRI to see whether they’d missed anything. They discovered some tumor remained.Again, they toiled in a hushed huddle with the knowledge that they were up against the hypothalamus, where a misstep could wreak havoc on Lily’s brain’s ability to regulate body temperature, nutrient and water levels, blood flow, the sleep-wake cycle and the most basic of human emotions: hunger, thirst, rage and fear.After surgery, Leonard told Lily’s parents that he thought he and his team had removed all of the cancer. Erika was stunned, almost too happy to believe it was real.“I’m staring at this guy like, ‘Are you lying to me?’ I don’t know what to think. It’s been over six years. I need to sit with it,” she said.James could not stop smiling.“I’m cautiously optimistic,” Leonard said shortly after meeting with the Deckers. “I think we got exactly what we wanted today ... this may be it. No more chemotherapy, no radiation.”Lily was groggy but responding to requests to stick out her tongue and wiggle her toes.On the morning of Christmas Eve, after looking at another MRI, Leonard confirmed the news the Deckers had never allowed themselves to wish for.The tumor is gone.Lily will have to recover from the surgery, which could take weeks, and only time will tell if there are any lasting problems — including short-term memory loss — that she’ll have to overcome as a result of the operation.As of Wednesday, she was experiencing diabetes insipidus, which is characterized by excessive thirst and large amounts of diluted urine. That could be temporary, Leonard said, but if it is not, the condition can be treated easily with medication. Children tend to recover quickly and fare well after brain surgery, he said.“If you get away with (removing the tumor), you can essentially cure this disease.”On the night before Lily’s operation, Erika pondered the possibility before her.“This could be the last thing.”No one until Leonard had ever used the word curative, James added.The best they’d hoped for was that the tumor wouldn’t grow enough to cause damage and would sit there harmless and allow Lily to live her life.Part of what has sustained Lily’s mother and helped her to rise above fear and sadness and disappointment is keeping her mind on today, pushing away worry about the future.“I now can see her graduating high school and getting married and driving me crazy. It’s so hard to imagine,” she said.“I’m just so happy.”mcrane@dispatch.com@MistiCrane

Instead of her signature pulled-tight-and-high ponytail, the “Problem” singer wore her hair down, giving her overworked elastics a much-needed break. Without the style she’s become so famous for, it was almost hard to recognize Grande. Instead, her sleek center-part was a more mature—and flattering—way to groom her enviably thick, shiny strands. According to the Daily Mail, she was a little unsure about her new ‘do, saying, “My hair’s down and I feel so naked like that.”Related: Give Yourself Ariana Grande HairGrande’s surprisingly style quickly made her the top trending topic on Twitter and Facebook, with fans and experts all loving her transformation.@mary_in_fashion Ariana Grande looks so much better with her hair down! #MTVEMA2014‏@newzcard Ariana Grande lets her hair down for #MTVEMA today.

My real hair is back to brown and I wear extensions but I wear it in a pony tail because my actual hair is so broken that it looks absolutely ratchet and absurd when I let it down.”Related: Are Ponytails and Topknots Damaging Your Hair?Perhaps her natural hair has improved in the past months, but no one had anything negative to say about Grande’s new look. In fact, most stylists say it’s damaging to wear your hair the same way all the time—especially using tight hair elastics—so letting her mane loose is a step towards healthier hair. And in an era when changing up your look earns you tons of press, it’s a smart move to keep your fans guessing.   
http://smithsonianscience.org/2014/10/rare-american-warbler-stuns-scientists-by-adapting-thriving-in-a-new-ecosystem/	Rare American warbler surprises scientists by adapting, thriving in a new ecosystem	By John BarratSwainson’s warbler (Gary Graves photo)When Gary Graves cranks up his boom box and drives remote back roads through pine plantations in Texas, Louisiana and other southern states, a few locals often emerge just looking for a fight. “If they are in there, they’ll come out,” Graves observes. “When I turn it off they calm down a little bit. Then they start singing.”Graves, an ornithologist at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History, is referring to one of North America’s rarest songbirds, the Swainson’s warbler (Limnothlypis swainsonii). Highly territorial, male warblers come out to defend their turf when they hear the song of another male on Graves’ boom box. This method of drawing them out is nearly the only way Graves, or anyone else, would ever see and hear these small, secretive, olive-colored migratory birds that live and breed in dense underbrush.The global population of Swainson’s warblers is estimated at about 90,000, a low number attributed to the loss of breeding habitat in the U.S. and wintering habitat in Mexico, Cuba and Jamaica. After studying and surveying Swainson’s warblers across the South for more than two decades, Graves reports something remarkable today in the journal Bird Conservation International. Since the 1990s Swainson’s warblers have been establishing dozens of new breeding populations in industrial pine plantations across 10 different Southern states from Texas to Virginia.Gary Graves examining the type specimen of the Swainson’s warbler in the collections of the Division of Birds in the  Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History. (Photo by Donald Hurlbert)Unlike natural forests with many different tree species of many different ages, pine plantations are monocultures of one species, all the same age and size and planted in evenly spaced rows. They were once described as biological deserts.“Pine plantation forests are a new ecosystem that didn’t really exist before the 1920s in the southeastern United States,” Graves explains. “They represent a fundamentally new wildlife habitat.”Millions of acres of these industrial pine forests stretch from Texas to Virginia and are on a harvesting cycle of 25 to 35 years before they are cut. “They are the backbone of a $210 billion forest industry in the United States that keeps us in lumber for our houses, products from toilet paper to notebook paper and even woodchips to mulch your lawn,” Graves explains.A surprising plasticityOnce thought to nest only in lowland canebrakes in North America, Swainson’s warblers are now known to also nest in a variety of broadleaf forest environments. The fact that this species is now establishing breeding populations in plantation pine forests reveals a surprising plasticity in its ability to select new habitats, Graves says. This behavioral trait is one not shared by the endangered Kirtland’s warbler (Setophaga kirtlandii) of Michigan’s jack pine forests which has rigid nesting requirements of small trees and open areas; or the Bachman’s warbler (Vermivora bachmanii), thought to be extinct, which was restricted to the swamps and lowland forests of the southeast United States.A singing male Swainson’s warbler (Photo by Gary Graves)“Behavioral plasticity in habitat selection may explain why Swainson’s warbler has survived two centuries of intense forest clearing and habitat alteration, while Bachman’s warbler has become extinct,” Graves says.Swainson’s warblers find pine plantations attractive for nesting only during a specific stage in the forest’s development, when the pines mimic the early successional broadleaf habit these birds have traditionally used for breeding. Once the plantation pines reach about 20 feet high, the understory achieves a high-stem density and screening at about desk height that the Swainson’s warblers prefer. This condition persists for about 7 to 8 years, until the trees reach about 40 feet high and 15 years old. After that, the understory density thins out and the warblers disappear.Learning to like a new placeThere may be some type of behavioral learning, in the warblers’ transition to the pine plantations, Graves observes. “But its only been happening for the last 25 years and it appears to be accelerating. Sometimes we see these behavioral shifts in animals but we don’t know the mechanisms of why. These birds are just learning to like a new place. Sometimes these changes can evolve quite rapidly within a dozen generations, and the generation time of these birds is just one year.”Most plantations occupied by Swainson’s warblers have a certain weediness, namely broadleaf saplings, vines and shrubs growing along the edges of roads and streams crossing the forests. (Photo by Gary Graves)Swainson’s warbler breeding pairs require large territories of between 10 to 20 acres, which the pine plantations provide. Most warbler territories observed by Graves occurred in plantations planted on sandy loam soil, with normally low water tables, he says. “These pine forests may be creating a microhabitat at ground level where the birds feed on insects in the leaf litter, maintaining humidity and allowing them to live on dryer soils then they have traditionally.” Also, Graves observed, most plantations occupied by Swainson’s warblers had a certain “weediness,” associated with them: namely broadleaf saplings, vines and shrubs growing along the edges of roads and streams crossing the forests.Covering some 40 million acres in the U.S. today, southern pine plantations are projected to increase to 66 million acres by 2060, Graves points out in his paper. “Given the 25 to 35 year rotation cycles commonly prescribed for private and commercial plantations, and a 7 to 8 year window of habitat suitability for Swainson’s warblers in a typical stand,” roughly one quarter of these pine plantations will be suitable habitat for these birds at any given time, provided that other requirements such as deciduous weediness and soil moisture are met, Graves concludes. “If current distributional trends continue, forestry lands managed for short rotation pine plantations will soon support a majority of the global Swainson’s warbler breeding population.”

http://www.mandatory.com/2015/08/20/a-guy-figured-out-how-to-get-free-starbucks-everyday/	A Guy Figured Out How To Get Free Starbucks Everyday	Well here's a story that will make white girls everywhere attempt to rig the Starbucks system as well.Brad Halsey, a barista at Starbucks, shared his story in an email he sent to Kitchenette for their "Horrible Restaurant Customers" series; a story that involved one of his customers rigging the Starbucks system in order to never pay for another coffee again.Brad explains that the unnamed customer purchased 365 Starbucks cards and registered each one with a different birthday, and now the customer gets a free birthday drink every single day."Even though I know exactly how he 'beat the system,' he pretends that his app is just malfunctioning and it magically gives him the same free birthday drink every day," Brad explained in the email.Now instead of just leaving with his free drink and feeling proud he tricked a company that overcharges for their coffee, the customer enjoys torturing Brad by being extremely particular about his order; the type of customer that you've rolled your eyes at behind in line before, and strongly considered murdering."Two pumps of white mocha here, then add five pumps of vanilla. That should take us to this line here where you're gonna add cold heavy cream up to this ridge here ... it should be halfway between this line and this line. Make sure to add the heavy whipping cream before the espresso; it changes the taste if you do it out of order," the customer says, according to Brad."Then add your four shots — three regular and one long shot. That long shot is important, since you guys reformulated your machines, it's been hell trying to get my drink right. That long shot helps balance it. Then stir it for me, Mister Brad. Now do me a favor and add ice to the top there and it'll be easy as pie. I'm not picky so don't worry about shaking it or anything like that."This might be considered fraud, so it's best to stay from doing something like this and just continue paying for it like ay other human that will continue to complain about how expensive their coffee is, and yet still keep buying some.Via Business InsiderThis barista might lash out like this employee did: Starbucks Employee Flips Out On Customer Over Special Straw
http://jalopnik.com/whats-faster-a-laferrari-a-veyron-or-a-gt-r-powered-s-1646059190	What's Faster: A LaFerrari, A Veyron Or A GT-R-Powered SUV?	You know what's faster on a runway than a LaFerrari or even a Bugatti Veyron? A bunch of tuned 911s. But there's one surprising vehicle just as fast as both the Veyron and the LaFerrari and it's an SUV.Bruntingthorpe's runway is just under 2 miles long, so while a LaFerrari's top speed is supposed to be somewhere above 217 mph, it can only reach 207 there, just like a stock Bugatti Veyron.What's more interesting to see is what tuner cars can do under the same conditions. The fastest at VMax200's evoMax event was a 996 turbo bored to 4.1 liters, but that crazy Nissan Qashqai with the GT-R drivetrain beats a Lamborghini Aventador matching both the Ferrari and Bugatti. A 720 hp Ford Mirage GT also happens to be slower than a Ferrari F12.My conclusion is that what we need is a twin-turbo F12. Who's with me?
http://www.trinidadexpress.com/20150816/letters/have-they-never-heard-of-overkill	Have they never heard of overkill?	Can any Express investigative reporter tell us who is the mentally challenged person who recommended to the Prime Minister and the rest of the People's Partnership team, the saturation advertising we have seen lately on television?I have just watched the 30-minute Saturday night broadcast on a local TV station. The advertisement stating that, “Kamla has a plan...” was run at least 20 times during that broadcast. Over the last few nights it must have been run well over 100 times in the extended news broadcasts. It is run before and after almost every other commercial aired.Do the Partnership election “organisers” not understand that this is one sure way to turn people OFF? Have they never heard of overkill?Further more, I find it extremely offensive to see advertisements for the PM and Partnership pop up when I am viewing foreign material via my computer.For example, several times I have clicked on a video in a news item in the UK paper, only to find that I must see an advertisement for PM Kamla before I am allowed to view what I want. Worse still, when other advertisements are aired ahead of such news videos there is an option to skip the advert. There is no such option in this case.Ann Whittakervia e-mail
http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/11/05/toronto-holocaust-survivor-connected-with-a-difficult-past-he-never-wanted-to-dwell-on/	Toronto Holocaust survivor reconnected with a difficult past he never wanted to dwell on	Here is what Dr. Mel Goldberg knew about his life by age 10: He knew he was smart, because he got great marks, and because his younger, adopted brother didn’t; he also knew that getting good marks was better than the alternative; he knew he used to speak Polish, but had forgotten how; that he had tons of friends; and his adopted parents, Wolf and Tillie Goldberg, kept a scrapbook of his life in Poland — a life he didn’t remember — on a bookshelf in their home in an affluent part of Toronto.The boy would look at it, every now and again. Inside was a report from a social worker from Poland and a photograph of himself at age three, taken in a Polish orphanage. There was a menu from the ocean liner that delivered him to New York, where his relative, Wolf Goldberg, introduced himself as his “father” before the pair travelled by train to Toronto.The names of his actual parents, Ancel Gwiazda and Elka Goldberg, also appeared, as did the name of his village, Biala Rawska. The report described how he was saved from the Nazis by a Polish “farm couple,” and how his entire family — mother and father, siblings, aunts, uncles and cousins — were murdered in Treblinka, a Nazi death camp in German-occupied Poland.Dr. Goldberg, born Mendel Gwiazda in 1942, was an orphan.“I looked at the scrapbook a couple of times over the years and I would say, ‘This is interesting,’ ” he says. “But there wasn’t a hope in hell that I could trace anything more about my past. Who was I going to ask?”It is Holocaust education week, and the lesson of Dr. Goldberg — a respected 72-year-old physician who still puts in a solid work day at Toronto East General Hospital where we met this week — is, perhaps, that the past has a curious way of finding people, even those who don’t go looking for it.The young Mel Goldberg didn’t look back. He went to university, got an engineering degree and a medical degree, and then a job at the hospital. He married, had kids and built a life. When he was asked about being a Holocaust survivor, his response was, “So what?”He had no story to tell, or so he thought. No family photographs to point to. Nothing. Nobody. His parents gave him up to save him, an act of heartbreaking courage. They died. He lived.And looking back, he could only ever see things in the abstract. There was an outline, but the picture was blank.“I wasn’t one to dwell on the past,” he says. “But it was difficult.”‘There wasn’t a hope in hell that I could trace anything more about my past. Who was I going to ask?’It is more complicated now, this picture. Happier. Braver. Complete. A few years ago, he received a phone call from a woman, Her name was Lilka Elbaum and her parents came from the same village as his. They were among the 37 Jews who survived in Biala Rawska, out of a population of 1,500.“The survivors often spoke of a child who had been taken out of the Jewish ghetto right before it was liquidated,” Ms. Elbaum says from Boston.“Mel, and this wasn’t part of his life, but he became a symbol for others — a bridge between two worlds. He was the infant who survived.”Ms. Elbaum found him in Toronto, after much digging, and invited him to a reunion in Biala Rawska in 2012. No Jews live there today; the synagogue is a firehall. But locals are interested in the past. The Canadian doctor who had spent a lifetime looking forward started to look back, with the help of Ms. Elbaum and others.He now knows the names of his murdered siblings, Bajla, Wolf and Majlech, and the story of Waclaw Libera. Waclaw was a cobbler and friendly with Ancel Gwiazda, a Jewish leather dealer. Ancel gave the cobbler his infant son to save. But after Waclaw brought the boy to his parents, they turned him away. So he built a one-room house and lived there with his wife, Stanislawa, their daughter, Irena, and a Jewish baby, hidden in a drawer.In June, Dr. Goldberg and his family travelled to Warsaw for a ceremony honouring the Liberas for rescuing him. Irena, now a retired teacher, represented her dead parents at the event. The doctor kissed her, they hugged, they got along so well.“Here I am, meeting a lady who I spent the first three years of my life with, and the feeling of warmth was unparalleled,” Dr. Goldberg says. “And I find out all this information I had about myself was wrong. My birthdate on my passport is July 15. But I find out I was born on the 24th of June.“Everything has finally come together.”It is late. Our interview has run long. The present day is beckoning. Dr. Goldberg, a survivor of a fight he doesn’t remember being in, pushes back his chair, smiles and turns to leave.“I need to get back to work,” he says. “I have to go.”National Post• Email: joconnor@nationalpost.com | Twitter: oconnorwrites
https://www.yahoo.com/beauty/meet-the-women-who-swear-by-permanent-makeup-102313147773.html	Meet the Women Who Swear by Permanent Makeup	Photo: Dan Saelinger/Trunk ArchiveMakeup artist Charlotte Tilbury famously sleeps in her makeup—something best left to a professional. But what if your #Iwokeuplikethis selfie featured a fresh face and perfectly applied liner, filled in brows, and a rich, but natural lip color? Because that’s what life is like for women who’ve had their makeup permanently tattooed onto their face.“For me, [getting permanent makeup] was a no-brainer,” says Kathy Green, 39, who owns a cleaning business in Nashville. “I was fascinated by the idea because I wear makeup everyday. It really helps me that I already have the eye liner on.” Green had her permanent eye liner and brows placed by cosmetic tattoo artist Kathryn Alexander, who practiced in Nashville for many years and recently relocated to LA, where she works out of the office of prominent plastic surgeon Dr. Gary Motykie.Alexander has been in the beauty industry since she was a teenager, getting her start as a makeup artist at her parents’ Merle Norman cosmetics studio. She went to a training session 28 years ago after discovering the concept of permanent makeup, and she’s specialized in the procedure ever since. (She also has several celebrity clients, but she’s keeping mum about who they are.) According to Alexander, permanent makeup, which involves tattooing pigments into the skin, should look natural. It’s not about tattooing a bold cat eye on to your lid. “I tell my clients, ‘When you’re healed from this, I don’t want your friends and family to look at you and say, ‘Oh you’ve had permanent makeup done!’” Alexander says. “I want [people] to say, ‘You look great! What did you do?’ That’s good permanent makeup.”Eyebrow enhancement and eyeliner are her two most popular requests, though she also does lip color and scar cover-ups, especially for those clients who have had facelifts and want to cover the telltale signs. When a client comes in to see Alexander, she asks them a lot of questions about their lifestyles, looks at their coloring, and offers some advice. After the initial conversation, Alexander will draw non-permanent options on to the client’s face to test out colors and shapes, with a stern warning that it’s better to start off light—no Cara Delevingne brows here—and add pigment on subsequent visits. She offers a complimentary follow up visit three weeks after the initial visit, and says most clients “love it and want to add more.”Generally, Alexander fills in color for those who have sparse brows, though occasionally she’s had clients who have lost all their brows permanently due to illness or chemotherapy. Darnell Young, 26, fits into that category. She was treated for a chronic illness with medications that made her lose all her hair on her head and face, an uncommon side effect. When the hair didn’t grow back after several months and her doctors couldn’t give her an explanation, she started researching permanent makeup for her brows. “I’d go to hug people and half of my eyebrow would rub off on their shirt. In the winter if it started raining I would freak out and have to run inside,” says Young, who subsequently found Alexander. She had her brows done, and was thrilled with the results.Thanks to a numbing cream, the procedure wasn’t painful, and Young followed a rigorous post-tattoo regimen that included ointments and careful cleansing of the area. According to Alexander, there are a few days of scabbing and the work can look scarily dark at first. “I say, ‘When you wake up to use the rest room in the middle of the night there’s going to be a crazy lady with eyebrows looking back at you!’” she says, laughing. After a few days, the skin heals and the top layer flakes off, revealing soft color underneath. While the procedure is similar to regular body tattooing, the biggest difference is in the pigments used. Alexander says the iron oxide pigments she uses don’t change color (black pigment fading to blue is common in body tattooing) and the results actually are long lasting; 28 years ago her mother was one of her first clients and while the color has “softened,” it’s still there.As far as eyeliner, a little goes a long way. Alexander focuses on tightlining and drawing on a very thin line. “I go in between the lashes with liner. Not only does your lash line look thick and dark and really uplifted in the corner, but because of the contrast of the dark in between the lashes and the white in the color of the eye, it makes your eyes pop,” she explains. “I have clients tell me they’ve never had so many compliments on the color of their eyes.” That was Green’s experience, who says she kept quiet about her procedure to friends and family until she came clean to a friend who was considering getting permanent makeup. “I didn’t really broadcast it when I first had it done,” she says. “But my friend always told me my eyes looked so perfect. I thought that was a huge compliment. I wanted it to look natural, but I also wanted it to look good.” Permanent makeup remains a fairly niche procedure, and the industry has definitely had its share of PR mishaps over the years. A few years ago, the New York Times chronicled some of the woes, including the lack of regulation in the industry, the potential for disfigurement, and a spate of bad side effects due to contaminated pigments, which have since been recalled. Alexander acknowledges the issues her industry has faced, and admits that a lot of her work is correcting other people’s errors. “We went through several years of a lot of really disastrous work. We had to recover from that,” she says. “I do a lot of corrective work. People are more leery now.” Alexander’s clients haven’t had any bad reactions, and she used to patch test her pigments, but has had such good results that she doesn’t anymore and stands behind the quality of her work. Alexander charges $750 for eyeliner, $850 for brows, or $1,500 if you do both together. Kathy Green says that she knows people who have paid less and had less-than-stellar outcomes. “I’ve had a lot of friends who have had this done and went to someone less experienced, due to a lower price, and got infections. You do get what you pay for,” she says. If you’re interested in pursuing permanent makeup, there are two professional organizations, the American Academy of Micropigmentation (AAM) and the Society of Permanent Cosmetic Professionals (SPCP), which can help steer you in the right direction to a trained and qualified practitioner.Permanent makeup might seem like a weird procedure, but for those who have had good results, it is life changing. After Darnell Young got her eyebrows done, she surprised her husband after he returned from deployment to Afghanistan. He hadn’t seen her since she was bald and browless. Her hair has since grown in, but not her brows. “When he left, I was bald and had no eyebrows and he came home and I had hair on my head and new eyebrows. It was fun to greet him as a brand new woman,” she says. And Green is unapologetic to those who may scoff at the prospect of permanent makeup. “Now I’m very content with who I am,” she says. “I feel like if you can make something better, why not?”See some examples of Kathryn Alexander’s work here.

(AP) — Neil Olson put up a Christmas tree when two of his sons went off to war in 1974, vowing not to take it down until all six children returned to his Wisconsin home for Christmas. The same tree, he says, is still standing in his living room.Olson's oldest son was injured in the Vietnam War, and his disability has stopped him from returning to Wausau from Washington state for Christmas. So the tree has stayed up, still covered in the same ornaments, tinsel and lights as the day Olson decorated it. And the needles, though yellowing, are still there."The needles are kept on for a reason," Olson, 89, told the Wausau Daily Herald (http://mnhne.ws/1JRQnKL ) for a story published Wednesday. "It's supernatural, I say."Five of Olson's six sons live in Wausau. His youngest, Rich Olson, said the tree has become part of his father's furniture."It's like family now. I hate to take it down," he said.Despite its permanent status in his home, Neil Olson hasn't flicked on the lights since the year he put up the tree. The large, multi-colored lights are now nearly 100 years old, he said.View gallery This is a close-up of the 40-year-old Christmas tree that sits in the living room of Neil Olson of W …"It'd just blow up on me," he joked. "All that dust on there.

The local Cleveland Police Patrolman Union fired back, demanding an apology from the Browns for Hawkins' actions. Hawkins has indeed responded, but offered no apology.Speaking with the Cleveland Plain Dealer's Mary Kay Cabot, Hawkins gave an emotional explanation of his decision to wear the controversial shirt. "A call for justice shouldn't offend anybody," the wideout said. "A call for justice shouldn't warrant an apology." Hawkins said his heart broke for the families of the two kids killed in the shootings. The events also made him worry for the safety of his 2-year-old son.Still, Hawkins wanted to make clear that his shirt wasn't an attack on law enforcement. "I utterly respect and appreciate every police officer that protects and serves all of us with honesty and integrity." He added, "(It) wasn't a stance against every police officer or every police department... It was a stance against wrong individuals doing wrong thing. [sic]"As of now, it does not appear as though the team or league plans to apologize for Hawkins' actions.
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/12/04/reaction-to-grand-jury-finding-in-chokehold-death/21003188/	Reaction to grand jury finding in chokehold death	Reaction to a grand jury's decision this week to clear Daniel Pantaleo, a white New York City police officer, in the videotaped chokehold death of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man:PROTESTS IN MANY CITIESProtests were held in cities for a second day Thursday. Among them:Atlanta, where demonstrators gathered in downtown Atlanta, roughly 100 turning out near the Five Points MARTA train station.Chicago, where hundreds blocked Lake Shore Drive along Lake Michigan. Protesters were thwarted in their efforts to march to Soldier Field, where a Bears-Cowboys football game was scheduled. They reversed course and at the city's Dan Ryan Expressway, about two dozen demonstrators darted onto the road and briefly blocked five lanes.Detroit, where protesters lay down on the ground for a "die-in" at the city's Campus Martius at midday as temperatures hovered around freezing.Denver, where students from at least four high schools joined in protest. Students from Abraham Lincoln High School left class and walked about 6 miles to the Capitol, snarling traffic. Buses were sent to pick up the students after the protest.Minneapolis, where demonstrators decrying police treatment of minorities stopped traffic for several hours on Interstate 35W near downtown before rallying at City Hall. Some protesters were fast-food workers demanding higher wages and union rights.___READY-MADE AUDIENCES FOR PROTESTERS AT CHRISTMAS TREE LIGHTINGSIn an odd juxtaposition of heated emotion and holiday cheer, protesters found instant audiences at Christmas tree lighting ceremonies, though they still had to compete with the festivities for attention.On Wednesday night in New York, police presence was heavy as hundreds of protesters stood behind rows of police barricades jamming the sidewalks on Fifth Avenue within sight of revelers attending the lighting of the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree. A block away on Sixth Avenue, police in riot gear faced off with protesters behind metal barricades. But the annual tradition went on as planned.In Philadelphia the same night, crowds disrupted the city's tree lighting ceremony with chants of "No justice, no Christmas!" and other phrases, drowning out several performances. Still, the tree was lighted as scheduled.And Thursday in Boston, several thousand rallied peacefully although some blocked city streets while marching to Boston Common, where the city's annual tree lighting ceremony was underway. Demonstrators toted signs saying "Justice for All" and "Black Lives Matter" as they chanted. They later gathered outside the Statehouse. Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick said he too was frustrated and discouraged by the grand jury's decision.A second night of protests in New York City brought out thousands Thursday. They gathered in downtown Manhattan's Foley Square and chanted "I can't breathe" and "No justice, no peace" before marching across the Brooklyn Bridge, carrying replicas of coffins. Another group started in Harlem. The marchers also disrupted traffic near the Holland Tunnel, the Manhattan Bridge and on the Westside Highway.___IN THEIR WORDSWhat some prominent people in the U.S. had to say about the case:- The black community is not right to be upset about the ruling, said U.S. Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., in an interview with The Associated Press. "If this were a white person it would have been the same thing," King said, adding that Garner's death was largely the result of his health problems - something the coroner's report affirmed. "I'm not blaming the guy for being heavy; I'm saying if he was in different physical condition, if he was in normal physical condition, this would not have killed him," he said and later added, "He had serious heart deficiencies caused by obesity, caused by diabetes, and that's what contributed to his death. That's from the autopsy. That's not me."- "I'm not going to rule that in or out, but I do think that the American people deserve more answers about what really happened here and where - and was our system of justice handled properly," House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said in Washington, calling the situations in Ferguson and New York serious tragedies and saying there may need to be congressional hearings.- "The grand jury decisions in New York and Ferguson, Missouri, should lead to a "vital and honest discussion" about race and policing, said former New York Mayor David Dinkins, the first black leader of the nation's largest city. Families fear what could happen to "anyone's child" during a law enforcement encounter, he said, but it's crucial to "foster hope for fairness."- New York should consider better police training, body cameras on officers and other changes, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said on public radio's "Capitol Pressroom." The Garner case and others like it have a "corrosive" effect on society and cause many to lose faith in the criminal justice system, he said. Lawmakers should discuss improving the system and restoring public trust. He suggested topics including police cameras, law enforcement training and changes to the grand jury process.

Naturally, that’s a cause for concern, so Smith was asked after the game how he felt out there. This was his response.Steve Smith was asked about his stamina after being sick this week. "You can ask my wife about my stamina," he said.— Jeff Zrebiec (@jeffzrebiecsun) December 14, 2014Well, that settles that. We’d rather not follow up with Smith’s wife on the subject, so we’ll just go ahead and assume the 35-year-old receiver felt just peachy.Smith had five receptions against the Jaguars and became just the 18th player in NFL history to catch at least 900 career passes. The Ravens won 20-12 to improve to 9-5 this season.So what’s the moral of the story? Never question Steve Smith’s work ethic, unless you want an awesome response like this one.

Why the once-amazing device gets cranky and struggles to perform basic tasks or load apps?The answer lies in Apple's software, and it's a key part of the company's strategy to keep millions of people buying new iPhones.Apple releases a new mobile operating system every year, and that keeps a powerful cycle in motion. Each fall for the last few years, people have rushed to download the latest and greatest version of iOS, which is designed for -- and, as a result, works best on -- the newest hardware that is also released around the same time. In the months leading up to the release, many app developers furiously update their apps for the latest operating system.Here's how that affects you: If you have an iPhone that's more than two years old, and as Apple recommends, you've upgraded the operating system a couple of times since you bought it, you may find yourself wanting to throw your phone against a wall. It's likely gotten slow and finicky.For many, the solution is simply to buy a new iPhone.It's highly unlikely Apple deliberately slows down older iPhones just to get you to upgrade. The company declined to comment for this story. Instead, Apple designs the new operating systems, which have more features, take up more space and require more computing power, for the new iPhones. And a consequence of that is they don't work as well on older iPhones.The system has been pretty successful for Apple. iPhone owners in the U.S. tend to shell out big bucks for a new iPhone about every two years (which, not coincidentally, is also the length of the traditional wireless contract.)But with its latest update to iOS 8, Apple hit a few bumps.Last month, the company made the rare move of pulling an update to the operating system after some people reported it left their phones unable to make calls and their fingerprint sensors useless. Although Apple said the bugs only affected a small number of people, and the company soon released a fix, the episode led to a spate of bad publicity. That, along with the whopping five gigabytes of precious storage space needed to download the update wirelessly, seems to have made people shy away from downloading the new OS en masse. Apple fans are adopting the new operating system much more slowly than they adopted iOS 7, the previous version.Still, a huge number of people rushed to download iOS 8 in the first few days it was available.Justen Meyer, a 33 year-old who works in the pro sports industry in St. Louis, was one of those people. He regrets updating his iPhone 4S, which he says is now "slow.""It's horrible. My apps don't work. Twitter won't open," he said in an interview recently.Before the update, his phone was "perfect," he said. "I was completely happy. Now it's making me wonder if I'm going to go through this the next time I get a new phone."Meyer isn't alone. People complaining about their iPhones feeling slow after new iPhones and operating systems come out is nothing new. Catherine Rampell wrote in The New York Times last year that her iPhone 4 felt "a lot more sluggish" after the 5S and 5C were released. Sendhil Mullainathan, a professor of economics at Harvard, noted in another Times story this summer that Google searches in the U.S. for "iPhone Slow" spike when each new iPhone is released.Part of that could be because so many people download the new operating system at the same time, iMore Editor-in-Chief Rene Ritchie pointed out earlier this year. Apple releases its new OS to everyone at the same time, while Android updates hit different phones at different times. (This is one of the reasons why Android's operating system is so fragmented -- only a quarter of Android owners are on the latest version of the operating system.)iPhone models that are a year old -- the next-to-latest generation -- tend to do fine when they're upgraded to the latest operating system, said Mike Gikas, who as the senior electronics editor at Consumer Reports has reported on the testing of every iPhone that has come out.It's the older ones that begin to lag, Gikas said."We do know as the phone becomes older, the apps seem to become sluggish and some of the capabilities diminish," he said.Indeed, Twitter is full of people complaining about their phones slowing down after downloading iOS 8.finally got the iOS 8 update & I'm pretty sure it was more of a downgrade. phone has never been so slow or unresponsive. #rant 📱🔫 — travis (@originaliowaguy) October 6, 2014Ios 8 was specially made to make my iphone5 super slow. 😪 — shayiful. (@ShayifulEusoff) October 6, 2014New software has been slowing down older hardware since before we were jamming CD-Roms into our Gateway 2000s. What's different with iPhones is the sheer breadth of third-party software that runs on the phones. Apple has 1.3 million apps in its App Store. And in order for those apps to remain relevant and keep working, developers have to update them to work with Apple's latest software and hardware.Apple aggressively pushes developers to design apps that work on the latest operating system, said John Poole, the founder of Primate Labs, a Toronto-based company that makes apps to measure the speed of smartphones."Apple encourages developers to target the latest version of iOS by providing tools and APIs that only support the latest version of iOS," Poole wrote in an email to The Huffington Post. "For example, it’s difficult to write an app that supports both iOS 7 and the new iPhones' screen sizes."Poole added that Apple's huge publicity machine that is the App Store currently promotes apps and games for iOS 8, which provides a further incentive for developers to design for the latest and greatest.Of course, Apple wants to develop its software, too, and it isn't looking backward to make sure older versions of the iPhone work perfectly with newer versions of iOS. In order for Apple to remain a leader in the highly competitive smartphone game, it needs to innovate and focus on optimizing people's experience with the newest products."Apple faces that choice: Do they create an operating system that works well on older devices, or do they create an operating system that takes advantage of the latest hardware?" Poole said. "Apple's focus has been to make a compelling operating system that takes advantage of the latest phones rather than an operating system that will work well on older phones."And therein lies the conundrum -- or, if you're Apple, the genius: You want to download Apple's latest software since that's what developers are developing apps for, and it comes with new features and important security fixes. But if your phone's more than a year old, it may slow it down.Christopher Mims, a former technology and science editor for Quartz who's now a technology columnist at The Wall Street Journal, has been using Apple products for more than 20 years. In a story for Quartz last year, Mims explained how he's found a way to get more time out of an older iPhone: He simply chooses not to download the latest operating system."Except for small, incremental updates, do not upgrade the operating system of the hardware you are using," he wrote. "Especially if it’s currently getting the job done."Mims now has an iPhone 5S, last year's flagship phone. And he has no plans to download iOS 8."The only time you should [update your OS] is when critical apps stop working and demand you upgrade to the new OS," Mims told HuffPost via Twitter. "Apple has always been like this. It was true with Macs, now it's true with iPhones. Incremental upgrades are fine. But whole number upgrades? Just don't. You get them when you get a new phone."

http://www.aol.com/article/2014/12/06/american-south-african-hostages-killed-in-yemen/21003753/	American, South African hostages killed in Yemen	SANAA, Yemen (AP) - An American photojournalist and a South African teacher held by al-Qaida militants in Yemen were killed Saturday during a U.S.-led rescue operation that President Barack Obama said he ordered because of "imminent danger" to the U.S. hostage.U.S. officials believe the militants shot the two men during a firefight, and that both were alive when American forces pulled them from a building on the group's compound and put them on aircraft, where medical teams operated on them during a short flight to the USS Makin Island, a Navy ship in the region.South African Pierre Korkie is believed to have died during the flight, while American Luke Somers died on the ship, according to senior U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because the information had yet to be approved for release.About 40 U.S. special operations forces were part of the mission, according to the U.S. officials. The rescuers, backed by Yemeni ground forces, got within 100 meters of the compound in southern Shabwa province when they were spotted by the militants, and the skirmish ensued.Yemen's highest security body, the Supreme Security Committee, issued a rare statement acknowledging that the country's forces had carried out the raid with "American friends." The committee said all the militants who were holding the hostages were killed in the operation.The second rescue attempt in less than two weeks to free Somers was prompted by a video posted online earlier in the week in which al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula threatened to kill photographer Luke Somers within 72 hours.But an aid group helping negotiate Korkie's release said he was to be freed Sunday and his wife was told that "the wait is almost over."In a statement, Obama did not address Korkie by name, only saying he "authorized the rescue of any other hostages held in the same location as Luke." The South African government did not immediately comment on Korkie's death.Information "indicated that Luke's life was in imminent danger," Obama said. "Based on this assessment, and as soon as there was reliable intelligence and an operational plan, I authorized a rescue attempt."Officials said Obama authorized the rescue mission Friday morning and was informed that evening about the outcome.Lucy Somers, the photojournalist's sister, told The Associated Press that she and her father learned of her 33-year-old brother's death from FBI agents at 0500 GMT (12 a.m. EST) Saturday."We ask that all of Luke's family members be allowed to mourn in peace," she said from near London.Yemen's national security chief, Maj. Gen. Ali al-Ahmadi, said the militants planned to kill Luke Somers on Saturday, and that prompted the joint mission."Al-Qaida promised to conduct the execution (of Somers) today so there was an attempt to save them but unfortunately they shot the hostage before or during the attack," al-Ahmadi said at a conference in Manama, Bahrain.The operation began before dawn Saturday in a province that is a stronghold of al-Qaida's branch in Yemen. U.S. drones struck first the Wadi Abdan area first, followed by strafing runs by jets before Yemeni ground forces moved in, a Yemeni security official said. Helicopters flew in more forces to raid the house where the two men were held, he said.At least nine al-Qaida militants were killed in an initial drone strike, another security official said. Both spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to reporters.U.S. officials said no American forced were killed or injured. The American military team was on the ground for about 30 minutes. Officials also said that based on the location on the compound where Somers and Korkie were found, there was no possibility that the hostages were killed by American fire.U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said the rescue mission was "extremely well executed, and was complicated and risky. The two men "were murdered by the AQAP terrorists during the course of the operation," Hagel said during a visit to Afghanistan.The rescue mission was the second by U.S. and Yemeni forces searching for Somers, among the roughly dozen hostages believed held by al-Qaida militants in Yemen.On Nov. 25, American special operations forces and Yemeni soldiers raided a remote al-Qaida safe haven in a desert region near the Saudi border, freeing eight captives, including Yemenis, a Saudi and an Ethiopian. Somers, a Briton and four others had been moved days earlier, officials later said.Following that first raid, al-Qaida militants released a video Thursday that showed Somers. The group threatened to kill him in three days if the United States did not meet unspecified demands or if another rescue was made.Somers was kidnapped in September 2013 as he left a supermarket in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, said Fakhri al-Arashi, chief editor of the National Yemen, where Somers worked as a copy editor and a freelance photographer during the 2011 uprising in Yemen.Before her brother's death, Lucy Somers released an online video describing him as a romantic who "always believes the best in people." She ended with the plea: "Please let him live."In a statement, Somers' father, Michael, also called his son "a good friend of Yemen and the Yemeni people" and asked for his safe release.Korkie was kidnapped in the Yemeni city of Taiz in May 2013, along with his wife, Yolande. Militants later released her after a nongovernmental group, Gift of the Givers, helped negotiate for her freedom. Those close to Korkie said al-Qaida militants demanded a $3 million ransom for his release."The psychological and emotional devastation to Yolande and her family will be compounded by the knowledge that Pierre was to be released by al-Qaida tomorrow," Gift of Givers said in a statement Saturday."A team of Abyan leaders met in Aden this morning and were preparing the final security and logistical arrangements, related to hostage release mechanisms, to bring Pierre to safety and freedom. It is even more tragic that the words we used in a conversation with Yolande at 5:59 this morning was: 'The wait is almost over.'"Somers, who was born in Britain, earned a bachelor's degree in creative writing while attending Beloit College in Wisconsin from 2004 through 2007."He really wanted to understand the world," said Shawn Gillen, an English professor and chairman of Beloit College's journalism program who had Gillen as a student.Fuad Al Kadas, who called Somers one of his best friends, said Somers spent time in Egypt before finding work in Yemen. Somers started teaching English at a Yemen school but quickly established himself as a one of the few foreign photographers in the country, he said."He is a great man with a kind heart who really loves the Yemeni people and the country," Al Kadas wrote in an email from Yemen. He said he last saw Somers the day before Somers was kidnapped."He was so dedicated in trying to help change Yemen's future, to do good things for the people that he didn't leave the country his entire time here," Al Kadas wrote.Al-Arashi, his editor at the National Yemen, recalled a moment when Somers edited a story on other hostages held in the country."He looked at me and said, 'I don't want to be a hostage,'" al-Arashi said. "'I don't want to be kidnapped.'"More from AOL.com: Cosby accuser also testified against Marv Albert As many as 4 people stabbed, 1 clinging to life, aboard Detroit-bound Amtrak train Family of Tamir Rice files wrongful death lawsuit against Cleveland Police Department
http://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2014/12/11/7374859/gary-andersen-wisconsin-oregon-state-barry-alvarez	4 theories on why Gary Andersen left Wisconsin for Oregon State	Another coach leaves Madison, but why does Barry Alvarez keep watching them go?For the second time in three years, Wisconsin has lost a coach to an equal-at-best program. Head coach Gary Andersen has left Madison for Oregon State, stunning the Badger faithful and leaving athletic director Barry Alvarez grasping for options. Of course, Andersen was hired to replace Bret Bielema, who preferred the smoldering crater left by Bobby Petrino at Arkansas to Wisconsin.Why does this keep happening in Madison? Why are coaches so quick to leave for other jobs that look to be a small step down? Why does the Big Ten West's top program have such a hard time keeping a coach?Theory 1: Assistant salariesBielema made no secret of the fact that he felt Wisconsin did not give him a big enough budget to retain his assistant coaches, a point disputed by Alvarez. While it is true that Wisconsin's assistant salary pool was a paltry 40th in the nation and 11th in the Big Ten under Andersen this year, three facts cast doubt on the idea that Andersen left over assistant salaries.With the exception of Ohio State, Michigan, and Michigan State, every Big Ten team is in the same ballpark for assistant pay. The difference between the salary pool at Wisconsin and the rest of the Big Ten West is miniscule. Wisconsin paid $2.37 million to assistants in 2014. The highest-paid group of assistants in the division, Iowa, were paid just $2.77 million. Minnesota and Nebraska paid their assistants comparable to the Hawkeyes, and Illinois and Purdue paid less. Does Barry Alvarez expect his team to compete with Ohio State and Michigan on a fraction of the budget? Sure, but so does almost every other Big Ten athletic director. Indications are that many of Andersen's assistants are following him to Oregon State, which paid its assistant coaches under Mike Riley $2.35 million in 2014. Oregon State was 41st nationally in assistant pay, right behind Wisconsin. If assistant pay was a concern, we would expect to see assistants jumping ship for other jobs. But at Wisconsin, there was no indication that Andersen's top assistants were hunting for lateral moves to different programs. By all indications, most were out recruiting when they heard the news that Andersen was leaving.Theory 2: Academic requirementsSome have noted Andersen disliked Wisconsin's rigorous academic standards, which made it difficult to recruit and retain players.But, as Drew Hamm and Sam Brief at Bucky's Fifth Quarter point out, Wisconsin's standards for current students are identical to those at Oregon State. And the Badgers have the third-best recruiting class in the Big Ten at the moment, according to 247Sports. Andersen's incoming class was actually better than his class the previous year, and better than almost every class ever signed by Bielema.Andersen did lose one 2014 recruit, wide receiver Chris Jones, when he didn't meet Wisconsin's admissions standards despite being deemed eligible to play by the NCAA, but there is no indication that any other Wisconsin recruit had difficulty getting into school.Theory 3: GeographyAlvarez told reporters that Andersen wanted to move back to the west:"Gary felt that this was an opportunity for he and his family to get back to that part of the country, and he felt that he had to follow through with that opportunity. That was the extent of the conversation," Alvarez said.Andersen played college football at Utah and, aside from a one-year stint at Southeastern Louisiana in the late '80s, had coached in or near Utah for his entire career before taking the Wisconsin job. When he accepted Wisconsin's offer, he said that he had turned down other jobs because he did not want to leave Utah.In late November, Andersen was linked to job openings at Cal, Kentucky and Colorado. At the time, he expressed publicly that he had no intention of leaving Utah State in the context that he loved coaching and living In Logan, and he didn't see himself as a fit in any of those programs. "When I said no then,'' he pointed out, "I said no to those different places.''Certainly, homesickness could be a factor. But Andersen has also had to rely heavily on his western connections in recruiting since arriving in Madison. His first class at Wisconsin was spread across the country, but the recruits set to sign this February include players from California, Utah, and even as far as American Samoa.To be successful at Wisconsin, a coach has to be able to recruit nationally -- Bielema was, and remains, an excellent recruiter in Florida -- but if Andersen's base of talent was going to be in the west, it would make sense for his team to be there, as well.Theory 4: Barry AlvarezLong is the shadow cast over the Wisconsin program by Alvarez, the coach who resurrected it in the 1990s and remains the athletic director. Alvarez instilled the run-heavy pro-style cro-magnon DNA in the Wisconsin program that was only extended by the similarly-minded Bielema. Alvarez stressed Wisconsin Football would remain Wisconsin Football when Andersen was hired. For his part, Andersen was quick to dismiss any talk of spread offenses.Andersen had not worked under Alvarez before, and his tactical changes -- a 3-4 defense as opposed to Wisconsin's traditional 4-3, use of a dual-threat quarterback and option plays on offense -- still met Alvarez's philosophy. But personnel issues led Andersen to utilize a clunky two-quarterback system this season, and while Alvarez never uttered a word publicly about the changes to traditional Wisconsin football, the changes themselves were evident.Two years ago, we said that Andersen would try to bring Wisconsin into the 21st Century. At the end of the day, Andersen might have tried too much for his boss's liking. But that's just a theory.

REUTERS/Petar Kujundzic (CHINA - Tags: POLITICS TRAVEL)At the rate first daughter Malia Obama is getting all the social media attention, reality star and attention-seeker Kim Kardashian should be planning her next nude photoshoot so she would again be the talk of the town.This week, Malia is the flavour of the month as she got three viral social media posts that cost one GOP staffer her job and would probably cost an NFL player his neck or career.The third hit for the 16-year-old daughter of U.S. President Barack Obama was courtesy of Darnell Dockett, a defensive end player of the Arizona Cardinals, who made the great mistake of commenting "Omggg" on an image of Malia wearing tight jeans that emphasises her rear end curves, posted by dreday_4 on Instagram.YouTube/ComplexHe then compounded his sins against the White House by reposting the same photo and adding his own comment "LmFaooo" which means "laughing my f- - - -  ass off."Similar to the flood of criticisms that Republican ex-Communications Director Elizabeth Lauten received when she described the behaviour of Malia and Sasha during a White House Thanksgiving event as "lacking class," Dockett, 33, was also hit by fans of Malia and other netizens.Cynthia Wesley wrote on TheGrio.com Web site that what Dockett posted was not cute. She told the player that if he had a daughter, he would have wanted men to respect her also. Another member named Yolanda Gomez wrote, quoted by the New York Daily News, "He just proved he is just another dumb jock."Like Lauten who was pressured into quitting her post, Gomez sought the suspension of Dockett from the NFL.Aware of the repercussions of his action, Dockett immediately removed the offending photo and caption and insisted "I never said anything about the presidents daughter 'not one thing.'"He probably is also afraid that like Lauten whose teenage shoplifting and overspeeding misdemeanors were resurrected in social media after she attacked the Obama girls, his teen life may also be placed under the microscope too.Now, the issue has spread to Malia's mum, First Lady Michelle Obama, to whom some Twitter members attribute being the genetic source of her eldest daughter's attractive back assets. Angela S. noted "She take after her mom in that dept."While Kim Kardashian may be flattered by such kind of talk behind and about her back, Malia likely is not as she also surely disliked what Lauten wrote and hoax news that she is pregnant.Read:Hoax Alert: After Being Criticised As Lacking Class, Malia Obama Hit By Fake Pregnancy NewsResigned Elizabeth Lauten Has Other Misdemeanor As A Teen Than Just ShopliftingLautengate: GOP Staffer Quits Over Malia & Sasha PostsCalls For Firing Of Republican Staffer Elizabeth Lauten Grow Stronger Over Facebook Criticism Of Obama DaughtersTo contact the editor, e-mail:

In one location alone, 14 people were rescued from their cars after an mudslide swept across a road. Seven houses on Gilman Springs Road were also evacuated due to the threat of mud and debris flow.In eastern San Diego County, a 60- to 80-foot-wide mudslide blocked a roadway, causing road closures at Dehesa Road and Sloan Canyon Road in the Alpine and Spring Valley areas. Further south in San Diego, cars in the city's Mission Hill neighborhood were underwater after steady rain the day before.In 24 hours from Wednesday morning until Thursday morning, San Diego received 1.89 inches of rain, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). To put that in perspective, the city only received 6.55 inches of rain in all of 2013.A coastal flooding advisory was in affect from Anaheim south to Chula Vista on Thursday. Streams and rivers in San Diego were flowing one to three feet above their normal level.The National Weather Services issued a flash flood warning for Sacramento County that expired at 11 p.m. local time Wednesday night, but some streets throughout the region remained overwhelmed by standing water.A flooded neighborhood in Sacramento, California.In Mill Valley, across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco, a man was filmed by a news helicopter paddleboarding in the flooded streets, according to the SF Chronicle.The heavy rainfall, however, won't be enough to end the state's devastating drought, which has reached historic levels.Have something to add to this story?

http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/11/10/4-thyroid-disorder-signs-may-not-notice/	4 thyroid disorder signs you may not notice	Many people expect weight gain and fatigue as they age, but how do you know when it could be something more serious?More than 20 million Americans suffer from thyroid disorders, according to the American Thyroid Association. An estimated 60 percent of cases go undiagnosed, which may put patients at risk for serious conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases, osteoporosis and infertility.The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland in the front of the neck that produces hormones to control the speed of your metabolism. The most common types of thyroid disorders include:Hypothyroidism, or underactive thyroid, in which the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough hormones.Hyperthyroidism, or overactive thyroid, in which the thyroid gland produces too much hormone.Thyroid cancer, in which cancer develops in the thyroid gland.Dr. Alyson Myers, an endocrinologist at North Shore-LIJ Health System in New York City, told FoxNews.com when it comes to thyroid disorders, it’s important to know what symptoms may be of concern.Weight gain and fatigueOne of the most common and noticeable symptoms of hypothyroidism is weight gain. Myers said patients can be quick to blame an expanding waistline on an underactive thyroid, but it’s the type of weight gain that can help determine if there is a hormone problem.“The biggest misconception about hypothyroidism is when people gain weight, they assume it’s their thyroid. But with hypothyroidism, it usually causes water weight, not stomach fat,” Myers said.Feeling tired and sluggish can also be a sign of an underactive thyroid. Experts recommend keeping a journal of your changes in mood and energy levels to discuss with your doctor.Weight lossSudden or extreme weight loss can be a sign of many serious health problems, including hyperthyroidism. When the thyroid produces too many hormones, the body’s metabolic rate increases. Myers said that leads to additional symptoms.“Besides weight loss, hyperthyroidism can cause daily episodes of the sweats, shakes and heart racing or elevated heart rate,” she said.According to Myers, sometimes symptoms are delayed and patients can go months before they develop physical signs of hyperthyroidism.Neck painSwelling, pain, or a lump in the neck is a red flag something could be wrong with your thyroid, and could even be a sign of cancer.“Most cases of thyroid cancer are very slow, usually subtle,” Myers said. “But in more severe cases, there is rapid growth in their neck that the patient can see.”The five-year survival rate of people with thyroid cancer is about 98 percent.Neck pain and swelling can also occur because of a number of other thyroid issues. Myers said if you experience neck pain or swelling, you should see your doctor, and noted sometimes these symptoms could be the result of conditions totally unrelated to the thyroid.Being proactive about thyroid disordersMyers said getting tested for a thyroid disorder isn’t difficult or painful—it can all be done with a blood test called TSH, or thyroid-stimulating hormone blood test. But if left untreated, thyroid issues can become fatal.“If it is a severe case, you could die from it,” she said. “It could be life-threatening because over production or under production of thyroid hormones could cause severe effects to the heart.”According to Myers, knowing your risk factors is crucial to avoiding and understanding thyroid complications.“The key risk factor is family history,” she said. “Also people who have had radiation specifically to their neck from conditions like esophageal cancer, and those with autoimmune diseases like lupus are also at a higher risk.”Concerns about thyroid disorders should be discussed with your doctor.

So far Willie hasn't had to nix any of his daughter's costume choices, but this one does seemingly push the boundaries a wee bit more than others have.It seems that Sadie loves the costume and says it's going to be fun to dance in. As for the switch-up week, fans tend to both love and hate this recent “DWTS” twist. It can be a blast to see the celebrities dance with someone new, but it can make for some stress as well.Luckily in this case, Mark Ballas and Derek Hough just traded partners. As PureDWTS notes, Mark and Bethany Mota are doing a hip hop to the Usher and Nicki Minaj song “She Came to Give it To You.” Derek and Sadie's song is the Cheryl Cole and Tinie Tempah song “Crazy Stupid Love.”Which couples will succeed and which ones will falter in the switch-up week on “Dancing With the Stars”? Most would imagine that Mark Ballas, Bethany Mota, Derek Hough and Sadie Robertson would likely all be pretty safe. However, their “DWTS” and “Duck Dynasty” fans need to make sure they vote to ensure they stick around.

The first-place Lions are 7-2; the last-place Bears are 3-6.But Marshall wasn't in the mood to play with the Lions fan. Although his original tweets either were deleted or protected, here is a screen shot of how the chatter started.View gallery. Brandon Marshall on Twitter.View gallery. Brandon Marshall's response.At least Marshall didn't want any money in return? Hey, we're trying to sort this out ourselves.So Anthony might have realized he got in too deep. If he was in the World Series Of Poker, we'd be calling his next tweet a re-raise, aka the amateur's response (other than folding, of course) to knowing you've gone too far.No response yet from the fan, who likely is huddling with his promoter.But Marshall was getting antsy — like a boxer? — for a yay or nay to the offer.View gallery.

http://news.yahoo.com/girlfriend-man-shot-ohio-police-walmart-dies-car-222826688.html	Girlfriend of man shot by Ohio police in Walmart dies in car crash	By Kim Palmer(Reuters) - The girlfriend of a man shot dead by police while he was holding a BB gun at an Ohio Walmart has died in a car accident, a lawyer for the man's family said on Friday.Tasha Thomas, 26, who had accompanied John Crawford to the Beavercreek store where he was killed by police in August, was pronounced dead at the scene of an early morning crash on New Year's Day in Dayton, the Montgomery County coroner's office said. Another person in the car, Frederick Bailey, 30, also died.Crawford, 22, was shot after a 911 caller said a man was pointing a gun at people in a Walmart aisle in the Dayton suburb.Crawford’s death came just days before the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown by police in Ferguson, Missouri, which spurred months of protests against the use of deadly force by police. Crawford and Brown were both black, and the officers who shot them are white.In both cases, grand juries decided not to indict the officers.Surveillance video released by authorities showed that Crawford had picked up an unpackaged BB gun off a shelf and walked through the store while talking on a cell phone before police arrived and shot him.Crawford's family last month filed a federal wrongful death lawsuit against Walmart, the city of Beavercreek and the officers involved.Thomas was questioned by police for more than 90 minutes after Crawford was shot, according to video released by the Ohio Attorney General's office. Police told Thomas that Crawford was dead near the end of the interview.Michael Wright, an attorney for the Crawford family, called Thomas’s death “tragic" in an e-mail. A spokeswoman for the family said she was not sure what impact Thomas’s death would have on the lawsuit.(Reporting by Kim Palmer in Cleveland; Editing by Mary Wisniewski and Mohammad Zargham)
http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1077299-anna-duggar-and-josh-duggar-not-pregnant-with-fourth-child-but-anna-wants-more-children/	Anna Duggar Pregnant? Josh Duggar Wife Hoping for Fourth Child Soon	Anna Duggar and Josh Duggar are not pregnant with their fourth child, they revealed in the 19 Kids and Counting episode that aired on November 11, but they do hope to be soon.Josh, 26, is the oldest child of Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar, who are famous for having 19 children.He and Anna, 26, already have three children–Mackynzie, 5; Michael, 3; and Marcus, 1.The family was featured on the TLC episode, traveling from their Washington, D.C. home to Chicago to visit Anna’s sister.They took an RV and stopped at a number of places along the way, including the Indianapolis State Fair.They also stopped at a dairy farm, where they saw a cow deliver a calf inside a birthing center.Watching the birth sparked a discussion about a fourth child. Both parents would like another one, with Anna especially enthusiastic.Anna said that watching the birth, though, made her have second thoughts.“I definitely want to have more children but watching the momma cow in labor made me thankful that I wasn’t pregnant yet,” she said.“But then when you see the birth, the fresh new life, it’s just like, ‘Aww, that calf is so cute.’ But babies are even better, hint, hint!”She also took the time to clarify that she is not currently pregnant. But based on the birth pattern in the family so far, she may get pregnant soon.Mackynzie was born in October 2009, Michael was born in June 2011, and Marcus was born in June 2013.
http://www.popsugar.com/moms/Photographs-Birth-Center-Birth-36082798	When Your Pregnant Photographer Captures Your Birth, the Results Are Stunning	For Alaska-based photographer Sharon Johnson, photographing her friend Elizabeth Ashdown's birth was a practice run. Not in the sense that she'd be shooting another birth soon, but 25 hours later she'd be the one on the hospital bed holding her newborn child in her arms."I was 39 weeks and six days along in my pregnancy when I photographed this birth," Johnson shared. "Not only that, but I was going to be delivering at the same hospital, with the same midwives, and with the same doula. So, when I walked in the hospital the midwives and staff definitely thought I was in labor!"Luckily for Ashdown, who went into labor three weeks early, her best friend's baby decided to stay inside just a few hours more. The two women, who are both photographers, met when they were both new to Seattle. "We moved to Seattle within a few weeks of each other, both had toddler girls, were both photographers, and found out quickly after meeting that we were actually married in the same venue on the same day within a few hours of each other. And we ended up moving away from Seattle within weeks of each other a year later. Crazy how our lives were so in sync."That rhythm between the women definitely shows in the captivating photos Johnson captured of baby Charlotte's birth. Johnson says she's constantly disappointed by her inability to photograph everything: "With every birth being so different you never know what to expect and I just photograph what is going on. Of course I have a system, as I should, but that system changes every birth to accommodate the situation, so a list of 'wants' just have me disappointed constantly." But we think it's safe to say this is one well-documented birth."I usually get a little teary-eyed at births, but this birth I was just a bucket of tears," she says. And we are, too! Keep reading to see how Johnson photographed the event.
http://www.voanews.com/content/food-prices-jump-in-ebola-hit-countries/2487328.html	Food Prices Jump in Ebola-Hit Countries	Food prices have climbed by an average of 24 percent across the three countries worst hit by the Ebola outbreak, forcing some families to reduce their intake to one meal a day, a World Food Program spokeswoman said Friday.The sobering news was offset somewhat by reports Friday that the outbreak has been contained in Senegal and that four people suspected of infection have tested negative in Spain.   The food-producing regions of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia in West Africa have been severely affected by the worst outbreak on record of the virus has killed nearly 4,500 people.Infection rates in the food-producing zones of Kenema and Kailahun in Sierra Leone, Lofa and Bong County in Liberia and GuDeckDedou in Guinea are among the highest in the region. Hundreds of farmers have died.The three governments quarantined districts and restricted movements to contain the virus’ spread. But those measures also disrupted markets and led to food scarcity and panic buying, further pushing up prices, WFP and the Food and Agriculture Organization have said."Prices have risen by an average of 24 percent," said WFP spokeswoman Elisabeth Byrs, adding an assessment of major markets showed the price of basic commodities was rising in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone and in neighboring Senegal.Staple foods affectedIn the Liberian capital Monrovia, prices of cassava and imported rice, the main staple food, have increased by 30 percent."Planting and harvesting [are] being disrupted," creating future problems, Byrs told Reuters. "There is a high risk that prices will continue to increase during the coming harvest season.''Byrs said WFP was carrying out a food security survey remotely using mobile phones to investigate Ebola’s impact on 2,400 families across the three countries.The first round of the survey of 800 people in Sierra Leone's eastern districts of Kailahun and Kenema showed people are worse off in terms of food security, despite being the main producing areas."The survey showed that certain families have cut down to one meal a day or that people are eating food that costs less, such as cassava instead of rice," she said.Senegal’s response praisedAlso Friday, the World Health Organization praised Senegal’s health officials for responding quickly after confirming Ebola in a young man August 29 after he’d arrived in Dakar from Guinea. He recovered and went home. Meanwhile, the government continued monitoring his contacts for twice the incubation period of 21 days, turning up no new infections.Officials at the United Nations agency called Senegal’s outbreak “officially over” but said the country must remain vigilant given its close proximity to West African countries hardest hit by the epidemic.Negative tests in SpainSpain reported Friday that all four suspected Ebola cases hospitalized on Thursday, including a Nigerian passenger taken from an evacuated plane by police-escorted ambulance, have tested negative for the deadly disease. They will be tested within 72 hours to confirm the results, the government said.The three other people were a priest who had recently been in Liberia, a man recently in Sierra Leone who tested positive for malaria and a person who traveled in the same ambulance as Teresa Romero, Spain's only known Ebola sufferer.Spain is on high alert for the disease after Romero, a nurse who cared for two Ebola-infected priests before they died, became the first person to contract the virus outside West Africa. She is gravely ill but stable.
https://www.yahoo.com/parenting/words-you-wont-believe-have-been-turned-into-baby-126619829631.html	Words You Won’t Believe Have Been Turned Into Baby Names	PHOTO: CNETBy Pamela Redmond Satran, NameberryWith word names from Genesis to Justice, Miracle to Heaven now used for thousands of children every year, we have to ask where the craze for turning words into baby names will end.  The answer? Nowhere, as these words-turned-names from the extended Social Security list for 2014 proves.  Our picks for the most outrageous words that parents are using to name their babies.AliasGiven that Alias means an assumed name, this choice used for 28 boys last year feels particularly meta. A related name: Cypher, used for eight little boys. We prefer Genuine, a name given to five baby boys,AwesomeMany of the new word names can be a boon to their bearer’s self-esteem.  Eight little boys last year can say with all sincerity, “I’m Awesome.” Add to that the 25 girls who are Savvy, the 15 each who are Honest and Holy, 11 of each gender who can call themselves Majestic, nine boys named Wise and six who are Handsome.BossEvery parent who’s survived life with a newborn knows who’s the Boss, so why not come right out and choose it as your baby’s name?  Twelve boys were called Boss last year, with another 26 named Captain, 16 called Chief, and 12 named Master.  On the girls’ side, there were 24 little Goddesses of their parents’ worlds, along with ten named (why be modest?) Czarina.CoutureThe world of fashion has been highly influential on baby names, with hundreds of parents naming children after such designers such as Chanel and Armani, models such as Gisele and Elle, and even fabrics like Denim and Velvet.  There were 19 boys named Styles in 2014 and nine named Stylez, along with eight girls given the high-fashion name Couture.EliminateOkay, we are trying to imagine how a parent can spin this word name choice, given to five girls last year, in a positive way. Because Eliminate as in getting rid of waste is not very appealing.  And Eliminate as in slang for murder isn’t any better. Maybe it’s one of those words that sounds attractive if you don’t know what it means, like Chaos, used for nine boys, or Jihad, given to 28 hopefully-upstanding little boys?GambleHaving a baby is a risk, but you probably don’t want to come out and say so with your name choice. Still, five boys were named Gamble last year.  Fifty-four boys and 11 girls were named Lucky, while the parents of nine girls decided to go with Trust and another nine chose Fate.  Seven girls were called Victorious and six emerged as Winner.HaloWe suspect that most of the parents who chose to name their 22 baby boys Halo were inspired by the violent video game, but we’re going to focus instead on the beautiful Beyonce song as well as that circular thing angels wear on their heads.  Word names that relate to all things heavenly have long been among the most popular, with Heaven Number 338 in the US for girls and Nevaeh – Heaven spelled backwards – all the way up at Number 65.HarshThere’s a legion of tough new names on the march, and Harsh, used for 18 boys last year, is one of the, well, harshest.  There were also eight boys named Ruckus, six named Mayhem, five named Furious and another five called Rage.Indica and SativaFor those of you who don’t live in Colorado, Indica and Sativa are the two main varieties of weed. Indica was used as a name for 26 baby girls last year, while Sativa was given to 14 girls.  Interestingly, no baby girls were named Marijuana, which is an actual name.  Lest you worry the boys were left out, six baby boys were name Kilo.KindleIt’s an electronic reading device and now it’s a baby name, used for 15 baby girls last year.  We’re not sure what makes Kindle an exclusively female choice, except perhaps its resemblance to Kendall, as in Jenner. Surprisingly, there were no babies named Amazon though 19 girls were called Apple…and ten named Lemon.RemedyAs with Eliminate, we suspect that at least some of the 27 parents who named their baby girls Remedy were more attracted to its sound than its meaning.  While Remedy may be more upbeat than Eliminate, in that it’s a cure for what ails you, few people would want to be named after something you buy in the pharmacy.ShantyA Shanty is a rickety shack and it’s also a name given to six baby girls. Fourteen girls were called Sham, 12 boys were called Shade, ten girls were named Sway and five called Southern. As names, these S-starting choices are all very Shiny – itself used for five baby girls.ZeppelinWhat little girl or boy, or big one for that matter, wants to be named after a giant floating blimp that threatens to explode over the Earth? No one, that’s who, though 42 baby boys and 11 girls were given this name in 2014.  Why?  It’s a Mystery, used for seven baby girls

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/30/coconut-crab-hawaii_n_6392972.html	Giant Invasive Crab Caught Walking Down The Street In Hawaii	Earlier this month, Holly Cantere looked up to see a 4.8-pound coconut crab walking down a busy street in her suburban Honolulu neighborhood."It just kept walking, like there was not a care in the world when it crossed the street,” she told KHON-2. “Everybody slowed down like it was a pedestrian.”The largest terrestrial arthropods in the world, coconut crabs can grow as big as nine pounds and three feet wide, and they can live as long as 120 years. They've been known to shred trash cans, eat cats and tear up gardens. They’re so avaricious that one theory to explain Amelia Earhart’s demise says she didn’t drown, but crashed on the remote Nikumaroro atoll and was eaten by coconut crabs that then scattered her bones.They got their name because while mere humans need a machete to tear into a coconut, the crab's strong pincers can easily crack one.Although they are native to islands throughout the Pacific and Indian oceans, coconut crabs (or "robber crabs" because they scamper off with your stuff) are seldom found in the continental United States and are considered an invasive species in Hawaii.Story continues below... This coconut crab was spotted crossing a busy street in Honolulu, Hawaii, on Dec. 21, 2014. It was the first coconut crab captured there since 1989.Looking for help, Cantere bravely packed the neighborhood interloper in a box and called the state’s department of agriculture. The crab is now quarantined -- nobody knows where it came from or how it got there -- and once cleared, it will end up in an exhibit at the Honolulu Zoo.“It’s a rare event that anyone finds a coconut crab in Hawaii,” Robert Toonen, an associate researcher at the University of Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology, told The Huffington Post. The last time the department of agriculture found one in public in Hawaii was in 1989. (Toonen surmised it was probably meant for someone’s holiday dinner and escaped; coconut crabs that eat a diet heavy in coconuts are reportedly tasty.)According to Toonen, an infestation of coconut crabs in Hawaii would spell disaster for native species of birds and plants. He said they “eat any rotting material that falls to the ground, including leaves, coconuts and carrion … if they’re looking for food, they’ll eat anything they can put their claws on. A lot of the native species here are already under threat from other invasive species, so having one more nonnative predator is a concern.”Coconut crabs can grow as big as a trash can, as this one reportedly did outside a construction site.While coconut crabs aren’t allowed in Hawaii today, a 2011 study published by the scientific journal Plos One shows that a different species of endemic land crabs -- Geograpsus severnsi -- once roamed the forested mountains there. Though smaller -- the size of a human hand -- these crabs were discovered to have lived in Hawaii until settlers (and their pigs, dogs and rats) hunted them into extinction.Clarification: Language has been adjusted to specify more accurately the native range of the coconut crab species.

While it does have a bit more sugar than we’d ideally like to see it’s relatively low when you compare it to the competition. Save 120 calories and 5 grams of sugar by picking YoCrunch over Chobani.NOT THAT: Chobani Greek Yogurt Flip, Almond Coco LocoPer 5.3 oz container: 240 calories, 10 g fat, 21 g sugarWhile the majority of the extra calories and fat in this breakfast treat come from the almonds, the chunks of chocolate and coconut flavored yogurt are loaded with sugar.

http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/06/29/primary-care-shortage-health/11101265/	Supply won't meet growing demand for primary care	Federally funded programs will add at least 2,300 new primary care practitioners by the end of 2015, but the funding for at least one of those programs is set to expire at the same time, contributing to a massive shortage of doctors available to treat patients — including those newly insured through the Affordable Care Act and Medicare.The U.S. is expected to need 52,000 more primary care physicians by 2025, according to a study by the Robert Graham Center, which does family medicine policy research. But funding for teaching hospitals that could train thousands more of these doctors expires in late 2015.Population growth will drive most of the need for family care doctors, accounting for 33,000 additional physicians, the study says. The aging population will require about 10,000 more. The Affordable Care Act is expected to increase the number of family doctors needed by more than 8,000, the study says.Farzan Bharucha, a health care strategist with consulting firm Kurt Salmon, says the ACA should have focused more on the primary care shortage "because we already knew there was a problem -- and we knew implementation of ACA would potentially make it worse."Health and Human Services spokeswoman Erin Shields Britt says continuing to build the primary care workforce will take time, but she notes President Obama's budget working its way through Congress has several new ways to expand the primary care workforce, which includes nurse practitioners and pediatricians. The ACA, she says, significantly increases the number of primary care providers in underserved areas and increases Medicare and Medicaid payment for services delivered by primary care practitioners.ACA funding that added 600 new primary care residencies was part of a five-year investment that expires at the end of 2015, eliminating the chance to produce hundreds more doctors each year.But many agree far more needs to be done. Among the issues:• Other medical residency funding. More oversight is needed in the distribution of the current $12 billion in federal graduate medical education (GME) funding, which is used for medical residencies, says Bob Phillips with the American Board of Family Medicine. Hospitals can decide the kind of residencies to create and tend to train and hire specialists who bring in more revenue than primary care doctors, he says. HHS says reform is needed, but that it doesn't have authority to make program changes since the GME formula is determined by Congress.• Rising cost of medical school. For the class of 1992, the median education debt was $50,000. In 2012, it was $170,000, according to a 2012 Association of American Medical Colleges study. Gina Martin, who is finishing her primary care residency and plans to practice in rural Delta, Colo., says she faces $250,000 in medical school debt, which made her choice more difficult.• More lucrative specialty care. Payment rates for Medicare and Medicaid — the largest payers for primary care by far — tend to reward specialty, interventionist care over prevention, primary care and diagnosis, says health care consultant Kip Piper. Family physicians made an average of $175,000 in 2012, the third lowest of any doctor, according to the MedScape annual physician compensation report.• Scope of practice laws. States regulate and license doctors and have been slow to embrace the idea that non-physicians could take over some of the functions. Nurse practitioners and physician assistants should be performing vaccinations and strep tests, Bharucha says.Despite the challenges, Martin says her intention to pursue the field has never wavered. "I grew up in a system and I'm now training in a system that works toward keeping people as healthy as possible," she says.Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1lq2v5S

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/jimmy-carter-one-big-regret-152904479.html	Jimmy Carter: I have one big regret from my time as president	(AP) Former President Jimmy Carter. One event that marred the presidency of Jimmy Carter still weighs on his mind, he said Thursday.In a press conference held to discuss the details of the former president's cancer diagnosis, Carter was asked if he wished he had done anything differently as president.After thinking about it for a moment, Carter smiled."I wish I had sent one more helicopter to get the hostages, and we would've rescued them, and I would've been reelected," Carter said.Carter lost reelection in 1980 to California Gov. Ronald Reagan. Analysts and historians generally chalk up Carter's loss to a lackluster economy and the Iranian hostage crisis. Fifty-two American hostages who were taken from the embassy in Iran and held for months during Carter's presidency. The crisis culminated when eight US servicemen were killed during a failed rescue operation in April 1980, months before the election.Carter emphasized Thursday that his work with the Carter Center — a sprawling nonprofit that does everything from fight disease to help peace negotiations abroad — has been more personally satisfying to him than his four years as president, but he admitted that he would've liked to serve another term."That may have interfered with the Carter Center. If I had to choose between four more years and the Carter Center, I would've chosen the Carter Center. But it could've been both," Carter said, smiling.In 2014, Carter said that he could've "wiped Iran off the map," but instead opted for a helicopter rescue mission that failed."I think I would have been reelected easily if I had been able to rescue our hostages from the Iranians," Carter told MSNBC last year. "And everybody asks me what [I] would do more. I would say I would send one more helicopter because if I had one more helicopter, we could have brought out not only the 52 hostages, but also brought out the rescue team. And when that failed, then I think that was the main factor that brought about my failure to be reelected. So that's one thing I would change."Though Thursday's press conference focused primarily on Carter's health and plans for treatment, the former president took numerous questions from journalists and reflected on his life and personal accomplishments."I've had a wonderful life. I have thousands of friends. I've had an exciting, adventurous, and gratifying existence," Carter said.Carter jokes he'd like "the last guinea worm to die before I do" his Center fights worm-caused disease. — Kelly O'Donnell (@KellyO) August 20, 2015"The best thing I ever did was marry Rosalynn. That's the pinnacle of my life," Jimmy Carter says as he talks about cancer diagnosis. @CQNow — Catalina Camia (@ccamia) August 20, 2015NOW WATCH: President Obama and former President Clinton cross paths on the golf course More From Business InsiderJIMMY CARTER: 'I Could Have Wiped Iran Off The Map' Jimmy Carter Is Now A Record-Breaking Ex-President Jimmy Carter says he has cancer, revealed by recent surgery

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/11/09/textron-scorpion-fighter-jet-will-it-take-the-figh.aspx?source=eogyholnk0000001	Textron Scorpion Fighter Jet: Will It Take the Fight to ISIS?	One year ago, defense contractor Textron (NYSE: TXT  ) announced plans to build a new, budget-priced fighter jet. Now, the new Textron Scorpion could soon land its very first sale -- and perhaps go to war with ISIS.Textron's Scorpion is still in search of its first buyer. Will the United Arab Emirates sign on the dotted line? Photo: Textron.According to a Nov. 2 DefenseNews.com report, the United Arab Emirates is looking to beef up its air force, and is giving the Scorpion a good hard look. As well it should.A bit of background Last year, the UAE scotched plans to buy Typhoon fighter jets from BAE Systems (NASDAQOTH: BAESY  ) . Similarly, the Arab nation's plans to purchase as many as four dozen M-346 trainer jets from Italy appear to have hit a snag. Yet even as the UAE's air force seems starved for new planes, the country has taken on a role supporting U.S. airstrikes against ISIS insurgents in Syria.The UAE is using F-16 fighter jets to pound ISIS targets on the ground -- as is the United States. But using high-performance fighters for ground attacks is overkill. It would be more cost-effective to conduct these kinds of raids with cheap, light attack fighters -- such as Textron's Scorpion.The Scorpion is estimated to cost less than $20 million per plane (and perhaps as little as $17 million). In contrast, deagel.com puts the unit cost of the Typhoons that UAE recently passed on at $124 million apiece -- on par with the price tag of a Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT  ) F-35. And even the Italian M-346, a light attack aircraft that the UAE has been looking at as a possible jet trainer, is estimated to cost $48 million apiece -- more than twice the cost of a Textron Scorpion.Good enough for the job? Granted, at a top speed of 500 mph, the subsonic Textron Scorpion wouldn't be of much use in a dogfight. Italy's M-346 and Eurofighter's Typhoon both have longer "legs." But for the limited purposes of intelligence, search, and reconnaissance, or for plinking ISIS tanks and Toyotas in the desert, 500 mph should more than do the trick. To emphasize the point, Textron advertises the Scorpion as coming complete with a bomb capacity of 3,000 pounds, along with six "hard points" for carrying rockets and bombs under its wings.When you take out your calculator, and discover that for the price of a single M-346 you could buy two-and-a-half Scorpions -- or six Scorpions for the cost of just one Typhoon -- the case for buying Textron's new fighter jet only gets stronger.Textron's Scorpion -- a fighter jet "grounded" in the reality of tight defense budgets. Photo: Flickr.What it means for investors With Textron profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles basis and rolling in cash (with more than $1.1 billion in trailing free cash flow, according to the latest data from S&P Capital IQ), the Scorpion is hardly a make-or-break deal for the defense contractor. That said, the company did develop the Scorpion internally, without funding from the Pentagon, so it would dearly like to make a return on that investment.Winning a first customer for Scorpion -- which could lend confidence to other buyers considering the Scorpion -- has proven an elusive goal. The prospect that Textron might finally have found its first buyer, though, should lend the company's investors a bit of confidence.Textron has built Scorpion. It priced the jet right. All that remains now is for the first customer to arrive.Do you know this energy tax "loophole"? You already know record oil and natural gas production is changing the lives of millions of Americans.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eat-the-press/2006/10/04/oreilly-factor-labels-_e_30927.html	Eat The Press | "O'Reilly Factor" Labels Mark Foley As Democrat	from TVNewser.comTVNewser |  Brad Blog |  Posted Wednesday October 4, 2006 at 09:19 AMIt's just a misplaced letter, but what a misplaced letter: Swapping a "D" for an "R" last night, Fox News and "The O'Reilly Factor" labeled disgraced pedophile Congressman Mark Foley, longtime Republican, as a Democrat. Courtesy of TVNewser, here's a clip; apparently it happened a number of times over the course of the broadcast, though they deleted the reference for the rerun (which, let's face it, still gets plenty of viewers). As O'Reilly railed against Foley and his actions — entirely appropriately, and as he has done previously — the visual message to his viewers was that the perpetrator of these heinous crimes against children was a Democrat. This comes at a time when Republicans are desperately fighting the perception that they permissively allowed Foley to go about his business (and his "business") on the hill, and that they are no longer the party of upright moral values.Now, blaming O'Reilly for this is, of course, ridiculous: During a live show, he is obviously not the one at the controls. However, it's a pretty grave error and one that has Democrats steamed. BradBlog reports that though the "D-FL" was scrubbed for the rerun no explanation was given and, from the screenshot, the actual correction was not made; instead of being designated "R" the screen was left blank. Errors happen, of course; it's how the follow up is dealt with that really shows stripes. How O'Reilly handles this on the air tonight will provide some indication to how "fair" and "balanced" a position Fox is willing to take on this.

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2860481/Can-t-quit-smoking-Blame-BRAIN-people-simply-hard-wired-lack-self-control.html	Why some people just can't quit smoking	Scientists looked at images of the brains of smokers who had quit Those who relapsed within a week showed specific brain changes These brain changes distinguished them from successful quitters Showed reduced activity in area of brain responsible for working memory This brain network keeps people focused and promotes self-control  Smokers who relapse in the first seven days are most likely to fail  Findings could help develop interventions in the crucial first weekSmokers who relapsed within a week showed a decrease in the area of the brain responsible for working memory and self-controlSome people manage it first time, for others it's a never-ending battle. Now, scientists say they can identify the smokers who are most likely to relapse – by looking at their brains.Those who ended up relapsing within a week showed significant changes in their brain when they were abstaining.  The changes, which were not found in successful quitters, were seen in the brain’s working memory system.This is the part of the brain network that keeps people focused and promotes self-control.Researchers discovered that in people who struggled to quit, there was less activity in this area.They say identifying these changes to the brain could help distinguish successful quitters from those who fail at an earlier stage.The breakthrough could also help researchers come up with new ways to help smokers quit.The new test, it is claimed, has an 80 per cent accuracy rate. Most people who manage not to smoke for seven days after deciding to quit go on to be tobacco-free for at least six months afterwards.Therefore, giving support to people in the first seven days is vital.This is the first time changes people’s working memory - caused by abstaining from smoking - have been used to accurately predict relapse in smokers, said senior author Dr Caryn Lerman, of the University of Pennsylvania.The study’s lead author, Profesor James Loughead, also of Penn Medicine, added: 'The neural response to quitting even after one day can give us valuable information that could inform new and existing personalised intervention strategies for smokers, which is greatly needed.'Globally, five million die as a direct result of tobacco a year, and a further 600,000 or more die as a result of second-hand smoke, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).It has warned that smoking is the ‘biggest public health threats the world has ever faced’.In the U.S., where the study was carried out, smoking is at an all-time low in adults. However, there are still 42 million Americans who do smoke, including teenagers and young adults.In the study, researchers used MRI scans to explore how briefly quitting smoking affects the working memory.They recruited 80 smokers aged between 18 and 65 who reported smoking more than 10 cigarettes a day for more than six months.Volunteers had two MRI sessions: one immediately after their last cigarette and one 24 hours after abstinence began.After having smoking cessation counselling, participants set a future target quit date.Seven days after the target quit date, participants completed a monitoring visit, during which smoking behaviour was accessed, including a urine test.Past research strongly suggests that if a person is tobacco free after seven days, they will likely remain that way for six months, if not longer. It is therefore, highly predictive of long-term quitting success.People who manage to quit smoking for seven days are more likely to stay tobacco-free for six months or more, so identifying people likely to relapse within seven days is crucialOf the 80 people, 61 smokers relapsed and 19 quit successfully for this period, the researchers reported.Those who relapsed had decreased activity in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.This is a network that controls important functions such as working memory, compared to those who quit.Working memory is an essential function of the brain necessary for staying focused, blocking distractions, and completing tasks.NEW TEST COULD PREDICT IF SMOKERS WILL GET LUNG CANCER A new test could be used to warn if smokers are likely to develop lung cancer.Scientists have discovered that cells taken from the mouth and nose react differently to infrared light in people vulnerable to the disease. The results of these tests could help target CT scans more effectively - and potentially lead to earlier diagnosis and improved outcomes for lung cancer patients in the future.Compared with some other types of cancer, the outlook for lung cancer has not improved greatly over the decades. Only 10 per cent of patients will live for five years or more from being diagnosed. This is mainly due to the disease being diagnosed at a late stage.Professor Sam Janes, from University College London, said: 'This non-invasive test can help identify those who are at greatest risk within adult smokers, and may help target CT screening far more effectively.'Our vision for the future is that smokers could get a test in the GP or pharmacy, swab their mouth or nose, and the sample is then sent off for analysis. The earlier lung cancer is detected the better the outcome.' The area of the brain called the posterior cingulate cortex was also less suppressed in the relapsed smokers.This network is more active when people are in a so-called ‘introspective’ or ‘self-referential’ state - i.e. naval-gazing. The new test is said to have resulted in an 81 per cent correct prediction rate - a significant improvement on other tests.The prediction rate for tests which looked at withdrawal symptoms, demographics and history was 73 per cent accurate, and a test which looks only at demographics or smoking history was 67 per cent accurate.However, the researchers admit using fMRI images to predict whether people will quit smoking is expensive and therefore not currently feasible.But new interventions based on the information could be developed, they added.The research was published in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology. Previous research has shown relationships between these two networks of the brain.Dr Lerman and her colleagues published research earlier this year which found smokers suffering from nicotine withdrawal have more trouble shifting from the network in which they were ‘introspective’ into the ‘executive control’ network where they can exert more conscious, self-control over cravings and to focus on quitting for good.However, the new study is the first to use brain activity to help predict relapse in smokers.Today, there are known predictors for relapse, including age, the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence and other smoking urges and withdrawal tests, but the researchers say there  is much room for improvement.
https://www.yahoo.com/movies/farrelly-brothers-reveal-jim-carrey-made-7-million-for-102378340427.html	Jim Carrey Made $7 Million for Original 'Dumb and Dumber,' and Jeff Daniels...Didn't	Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels in Dumb and DumberJim Carrey was paid $7 million for the original Dumb and Dumber, while his co-star Jeff Daniels — who shared top billing! — made just $50,000. That’s one of the juicy tidbits revealed by directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly in their new Q&A for The Hollywood Masters. Carrey wasn’t a big star when Dumb and Dumber went into production in 1994 and the comedy’s total budget was just $16 million — so how did he walk away with so much?"They offered him $350,000 to do the movie and he passed," explains Peter Farrelly. "He wanted like $400,000. And they held off. And then Ace Ventura came out, which was his first movie and it was number one. So the studio said… ‘Okay, we’ll give you the 400.’ He said, ‘No, I want 500.’” Long story short, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective continued to top the box office, and by the time negotiations ended, Carrey’s salary was up to $7 million — “the most ever for a comedic actor,” says Peter Farrelly. As for Daniels, he got the short end of the salary stick because the studio didn’t want to cast him at all. “They said, ‘Please, anyone but him. Get a comedic actor,’” says Bobby Farrelly, who wanted to cast Daniels after seeing him in the film Something Wild. ”So they offered him, if I recall, 50 grand, which was, you know, Jim’s getting seven mil, they offered him 50 figuring he’ll say, ‘No, I’m not taking that,’ but he took it.”That’s how Carrey and Daniels became Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne, the dopey best friends whom they reunited to play in the new Dumb and Dumber To (in theaters Friday). It was Carrey’s suggestion to revisit Dumb and Dumber twenty years later.  ”Jim was in a hotel and he watched, it was on TV, and he flipped the tube on, watched it straight through and he thought, ‘We got to do another one,’” says Peter Farrelly. Judging from the trailers alone, the sequel rivals the original Dumb and Dumber for raunchiness. But even the Farrelly Brothers admit that the shock value of the first film could be hard to top. Peter mentions, in particular, the bathroom scene from Dumb and Dumber. “I mean we were clearly pushing the envelope. That was unprecedented that somebody sat on a toilet and we stuck with it because up to that point in human history, whenever somebody got on a toilet in a movie, the door would shut and that’s that,” he explains. Another shock that the Dumb and Dumber To audience won’t experience? That rumored cameo from Jennifer Lawrence. The Farrelly brothers insist that no cameo was ever filmed; the closest they came, says Bobby, was having dinner with Lawrence in Atlanta while she was shooting The Hunger Games. Watch a teaser for Dumb and Dumber To:
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/12/06/advocates-fear-impact-of-rolling-stone-apology/21003750/	Advocates fear impact of Rolling Stone apology	CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- Advocates for sexual-assault victims say Rolling Stone's backpedaling from an explosive account of a gang rape at the University of Virginia doesn't change the fact that rape is a problem on college campuses and must be confronted - even as some expressed concern that the magazine's apology could discourage victims from coming forward.Students, state government and education leaders, meanwhile, pledged to continue ongoing efforts to adequately respond to - and prevent - sexual assaults on campus.Rolling Stone cast doubt on its story Friday of a gang rape by a woman it identified only as "Jackie," saying it has since learned of "discrepancies" in her account."Our trust in her was misplaced," the magazine's editor, Will Dana, wrote in a signed apology.The lengthy article published last month used Jackie's case as an example of what it called a culture of sexual violence hiding in plain sight at U.Va.Alison Kiss, executive director of the Clery Center for Security On Campus, said groups who work in the area will be concerned about a "chilling effect" Rolling Stone's apology could have on sexual-assault victims reporting the crimes.But she said the magazine's announcement Friday "doesn't change the facts: Sexual assault on campus is drastically underreported and false reports are incredibly rare."Emily Renda, U.Va.'s project coordinator for sexual misconduct, policy and prevention, and a member of the governor's Task Force on Combating Campus Sexual Violence, said she didn't question Jackie's credibility because that wasn't her role. Renda knows Jackie and also was interviewed for the Rolling Stone article."Rolling Stone played adjudicator, investigator and advocate - and did a slipshod job at that," added Renda, a May graduate who said she was raped her freshman year at the school. "As a result Jackie suffers, the young men in Phi Kappa Psi suffered, and survivors everywhere can unfairly be called into question."Karen Chase, an English professor at U.Va. and Jackie's faculty adviser, said that she doesn't believe Jackie would knowingly say something that wasn't true."Jackie is a lovely person who never sought and who thoroughly disdains publicity or sensation," Chase said. "She spoke in good faith, and she deserves respect."She added that regardless of whether there were incorrect details in the student's account, "We don't need Jackie's story to substantiate the problem of rape on this, or any other campus."Victoria Olwell, one of the organizers of a protest rally on campus after the magazine story came out, said that it was Rolling Stone's credibility that was damaged."Actually, campus activists have been disputing one aspect of the story all along," which was the magazine's "depiction of them as quiescent," she said. "I think that we've seen in the last two weeks how effective we can be in mobilizing students, staff, faculty, and the administration to prevent sexual assault and penalize it more severely."Rolling Stone said that because Jackie's story was sensitive, the magazine honored her request not to contact the men who she claimed organized and participated in the attack. That prompted criticism from other news organizations."We were trying to be sensitive to the unfair shame and humiliation many women feel after a sexual assault and now regret the decision to not contact the alleged assaulters to get their account," the magazine's statement said. "We are taking this seriously and apologize to anyone who was affected by the story."The statement Rolling Stone posted on its website said discrepancies in the woman's account became apparent "in the face of new information," but provided no details about what facts might be in question.That wasn't enough for some."It is deeply troubling that Rolling Stone magazine is now publicly walking away from its central storyline in its bombshell report on the University of Virginia without correcting what errors its editors believe were made," Attorney General Mark Herring said in a statement.The original story noted that a dangerous mix of alcohol, date-rape drugs and forced sex at fraternity parties is by no means unique to any one U.S. university. In fact, U.Va. is one of 90 schools facing Title IX sexual-violence investigations from the Education Department, a list that includes four others in Virginia: the College of William and Mary; James Madison University; the University of Richmond; and Virginia Military Institute.But U.Va was roiled by the article, whose main allegation was that too many people at the university put protecting the school's image and their own reputations above seeking justice for sex crimes. The story prompted protests, classroom debates, formal investigations and a suspension of fraternity activities.Phi Kappa Psi, where the gang rape allegedly occurred on Sept. 28, 2012, was attacked after the article was published, with cinderblocks thrown through the fraternity house's windows.The fraternity issued its own statement disputing the account of Jackie, who described being led upstairs by her date, who then allegedly orchestrated her gang-rape by seven men as he and another watched."No ritualized sexual assault is part of our pledging or initiation process," the statement said. "This notion is vile, and we vehemently" dispute the claim. "We continue to be shocked by the allegations and saddened by this story. We have no knowledge of these alleged acts being committed at our house or by our members. Anyone who commits any form of sexual assault, wherever or whenever, should be identified and brought to justice."College officials and state leaders said Friday's developments would not stop ongoing efforts to respond to - and prevent - sexual assaults on campus.Over the past two weeks, the college community "has been more focused than ever" on the issue, U.Va. President Teresa Sullivan said Friday in a statement."Today's news must not alter this focus," Sullivan said.Gov. Terry McAuliffe's spokeswoman, Rachel Thomas, said the governor has asked for an investigation while continuing to work with state and educational leaders "to ensure that Virginia's college campuses are leaders in prevention, response, and awareness efforts."Some state lawmakers proposed legislation requiring university officials to report sex assault allegations to the criminal justice system, rather than try to handle cases themselves. Another proposed requiring campus police to report assaults to local prosecutors within 48 hours.Sullivan asked Charlottesville police to investigate the alleged gang rape. The police inquiry continued Friday.A vigil organized by high school students in support of sexual-assault victims prior to Rolling Stone's announcement took place as planned on the U.Va. campus Friday evening, with several dozen high school and college students in attendance.---Frommer reported from Washington.

Police did not say where exactly or how they were discovered.(Reporting by Amanda Orr, Editing by Alex Dobuzinskis)

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/11290816/Lee-Harvey-Oswald-coffin-embroiled-in-legal-row.html	Lee Harvey Oswald coffin at centre of legal row	Lee Harvey Oswald's brother is suing the funeral home which interred the presidential assassin after learning that the company sold Oswald's coffin through a Los Angeles auction house.Robert Oswald has accused Baumgardner Funeral Home in Fort Worth, Texas of acting in bad taste for selling the coffin for $87,468 (£55,682).Three days after he assassinated President Kenney in 1963, Oswald was shot and killed by nightclub owner Jack Ruby and was laid to rest in a Fort Worth cemetery.His body was exhumed in 1981 and he was reburied in a new coffin, with the original remaining in a store room at the funeral home.Allen Baumgardner, who took over the business, decided to cash in on Oswald's notoriety by putting the coffin up for sale via Nate D Sanders auction house.This proved too much for Robert Oswald, 80, who has asked a court in Fort Worth to block the sale.Giving evidence via video-link, he said the sale of the coffin was in "bad taste" and described himself as its rightful owner. He had assumed the coffin had been destroyed after the exhumation.He knew of no case where anybody had ever bought a used coffin, he told State District Judge Don Cosby during a two-day trial."He doesn't want money. He doesn't want the casket in a museum," said Grant Grimes, Mr Oswald's lawyer. "He wants the thing destroyed. There's got to be a limit somewhere on what the public deserves as part of historical curiosity and just good taste."Mr Baumgardner insisted that as the coffin was unclaimed for decades he was the rightful owner.When the original coffin was bought by Robert Oswald, it was a gift to his dead brother and formed part of his estate.Mr Baumgardner argued that as neither Oswald's widow nor daughters had claimed the coffin, ownership was vested with the funeral home.It is not the only item of grim memorabilia being put up for sale by the funeral home, which has approached a number of museums.Other lots include the original death certificate, which was invalidated because of an error, and the embalming table.The coffin itself is in poor condition, having suffered water damage and the ravages of time and decay.A ruling is expected before Christmas.
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/9-financial-concepts-every-functioning-183000672.html	9 Financial Concepts Every Functioning Adult Should Know	Flickr / Vitor Esteves It's a good place to start.When you're the one in charge of your money, it's best to have some understanding of basic financial concepts.But where to start? Save some Googling with this list of what to know about money by age 30, created with the help of certified financial planner Mary Beth Storjohann, founder of Workable Wealth.1. Net worth"Your net worth is a measure of your financial health," Storjohann says. It's the result of your total assets minus the total amount you owe.You're in good financial health if your net worth is well into the positives, and you have some work to do if your net worth is anywhere in the negatives. "Net worth can also be used to measure how far you've come over time," Storjohann says.2. InflationInflation refers to the sustained increase in the price of goods and services. As prices rise due to inflation, you'll be able to afford less and less. Storjohann points out that the historical inflation rate is 3% per year."What's most important is whether your income is rising at the same rate as inflation," Storjohann says. If your pay is not keeping up with inflation, you won't be able to afford much a few years down the road.3. Liquidity"Liquidity is how accessible your money is," Storjohann says. Cash is the most liquid your money can be, because you can access it immediately. While the inaccessibility of certain assets, such as your home or your retirement accounts, gives them time to gain value, there are some cases where you want money at your fingertips."Your emergency fund should be in a cash account since it needs to be readily available in case of an emergency," Storjohann says. "Money you have invested in the stock market is not as available, because you risk losing some of it if you take it out."4. Bull marketA bull market refers to a market that is on the rise, which is a good thing. That means that prices of shares in the market are increasing. Usually a bull market also means the economy is in a good state, and the level of unemployment is low. The US is currently in a bull market.5. Bear marketA bear market is the opposite of bull. In other words, the market is declining. Share prices are decreasing, the economy is in a downfall, and unemployment levels are rising.It sounds like a bad thing (and it certainly isn't good), but Storjohann says the most important thing to keep in mind is that the market is a "rollercoaster," meaning it's bound to go up and down and people shouldn't panic every time the market looks a little ursine. "Millennials have time on their side," she explains, "and over time money has the ability to grow."  6. Risk toleranceRemember that roller coaster we were discussing a moment ago? According to Storjohann, risk tolerance refers to how comfortable you are with these swings. "It's about whether you understand the cycle or stress out about it," she says. How high your risk tolerance is determines how aggressive you can be with your investments.Risk tolerance isn't just emotional — it depends on how much time you have to invest, your future earning potential, and the assets you have that are not invested, such as your home or inheritance. Major banks such as Wells Fargo, Merrill Lynch, and Vanguard provide online tools to help determine your own.Flickr / André Benedix Your net worth says a lot about your financial situation. 7. Asset allocation and diversificationAsset allocation — where you keep your money — depends on your individual needs and goals. It's also the basis of diversification. The goal of diversification is managing the risk we touched on in point six — if you keep your eggs "all in one basket," as Storjohann describes it, what happens to your wealth if the basket falls and breaks? You're going to want some wealth stored elsewhere. "Diversification allows for balancing," Storjohann says. "You give up some upsides, but you lower some downsides." Be aware that simply scattering your investments around might not be effective. To be effectively diversified, you have to be strategic about where you invest.8. InterestInterest can work for or against you, depending on the context.When it comes to saving money, "Interest means your money is going to work for you," Storjohann says. When you put your money in a savings account at a bank, you're letting that bank borrow your money. Interest is what they pay you to borrow it; it's a percentage that can go up or down depending on the state of the economy.On the other hand, when you borrow money from someone — think your credit card issuer — you pay interest to them for borrowing that money, just like the bank paid you to borrow yours. You'll keep paying interest until you've paid that money back, which is why it's important to stay out of debt, or if you're in debt, to pay it off as quickly as possible.9. Compound interestCompound interest is interest that you earn on a "rolling balance," and not on the initial principle, Storjohann says.Here's an example: If you start off with $100 earning 7% interest annually, after your first year you'll have $107. The next year, you'll be earning 7% interest on $107 and not $100 (you'll earn $7.49 instead of $7).It doesn't sound so impressive when we're discussing $7 at a time, but compound interest is the concept that powers the exponential growth of retirement savings. As Business Insider's Sam Ro puts it, "It's the deceivingly simple force that causes wealth to rapidly snowball."More From Business InsiderThis Is A Life-Changing Application That Every iPhone 6 Owner Should Download 9 Financial Concepts Every Functioning Adult Should Know 11 Websites That Will Make You Smarter About Money

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/05/pee-cycling_n_5651431.html?utm_hp_ref=weird-news&ir=Weird+News	Farmers Reap The Benefits Of 'Pee-Cycling'	This post originally appeared on Mother Nature Network.Human urine contains at least 3,079 compounds. Some of them are produced naturally in the body. Others of them come from the things we put in and on our bodies. Two things that are commonly found in urine are nitrogen and phosphorous, both very useful for fertilizing plants. It’s not uncommon for gardeners to pee in the garden or on their compost pile to add these free, natural fertilizers to the soil. It sounds a little gross, but it really does make sense to recycle urine for fertilizing gardens or farms, and the practice has a name, “pee-cycling.” In Vermont, the Rich Earth Institute is looking to turn "pee-cycling" into something more than just people heading out to their gardens after dark and peeing straight onto their garden soil. The organization is looking to stop wasting this nutrient-filled human waste on a larger and more organized scale. NPR profiled the Rich Earth Institute and its pilot program with 170 volunteers who donate their urine, about a quart per volunteer each day. The urine is collected and given to a farmer who uses it to fertilize hayfields in place of synthetic fertilizers. Rich Earth is currently the only “legally authorized and publicly documented urine reuse project in the U.S.” Is this “inherently local and renewable source of fertilizer,” as Rich Earth co-founder Abraham Noe-Hays calls it, safe? Yes, when it comes straight from the source. Human urine is sterile, and peeing directly onto a garden or compost pile ensures it’s sterile when it hits the soil. But, in a collection project like Rich Earth’s, there’s a risk of contamination in the urine-diverting toilets or waterless urinals that are used, so the institute is testing two different sanitation methods right now. So far the results of the pilot program have been encouraging. The 2013 hay fields that used “pee-cycling” for fertilization had dramatically increased yields, and now there are other farmers in the region who are on a waiting list for pee. In addition to being a useful fertilizer, urine that is kept out of local waterways reduces the need for treatment with harsh chemicals, Rich Earth Institute’s website explains. In 2013, Rich Earth’s goal was to collect 3,000 gallons of urine, and it reached that goal with 170 volunteers. The goal is double for 2014 and more volunteers are needed to donate to the program, but you have to live near Brattleboro, Vermont, to participate.
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/11/20/round-2-buffalo-braces-for-another-wintry-wallop/20996458/	Already buried by epic snowfall, Buffalo pounded by a second wintry wallop	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- A new blast of lake-effect snow roared through western New York with thunder and lightning on Thursday, raising to nearly 6 feet the three-day total in parts of the Buffalo area before pummeling already buried towns to the south with the threat of 1 to 3 feet more.But even as it strained roofs and stalled daily life, the snow wasn't the only worry. Forecasters warned a rapid weekend warmup and rain could turn all that snow into floods."It's a force of nature, a massive force of nature," Deputy Erie County Commissioner Richard Tobe said during a Thursday morning briefing, where he announced an eight storm-related death. "We're prepared, but the storm is gigantic and persistent."Even for Buffalo, a place that typically shrugs at snow, this was a stunning snowfall - the kind of onslaught folks will be telling their grandchildren about.Those living in the Buffalo area were already buried under as much as 5 1/2 feet of snow Wednesday, and they awoke Thursday to more. The roving lake-effect band dropped several inches on the city of Buffalo and then pushed into towns to the south, National Weather Service meteorologist David Zaff said."This is an historic event. When all is said and done, this snowstorm will break all sorts of records, and that's saying something in Buffalo," Gov. Andrew Cuomo said after touring the region Wednesday and talking to truckers who had been stranded more than 24 hours on the Thruway.The storm came in so fast and furious over Lake Erie early Tuesday it trapped more than 100 vehicles along a 132-mile stretch of the New York State Thruway that remained closed Thursday.Tom Wilson, of West Seneca, split a Salisbury steak frozen dinner with co-workers and tried his best to get some rest when he was stuck 36 hours at his warehouse job."I slept on a pallet. Then I slept on some office chairs, and then I went back to the pallet," Wilson said. "Then I found some sponges to lay on. I found one pack of sponges unopened. That looks like a pillow to me."We tried to make popcorn with a two-by-four, two empty pop kegs, some charcoal and a dust pan," he added. "It didn't work."Bethany Hojnacki went into labor at the height of the storm and ended up giving birth in a Buffalo fire station after she and her husband couldn't get to the hospital. Mother and daughter were later taken to the hospital in an ambulance.Cuomo, who stayed in the region overnight, said Wednesday afternoon that all trapped travelers had been removed from their cars, though some truckers were staying with their rigs.Asked by reporters how officials could allow people to be snowbound in cars for 24 hours, Cuomo cited a jackknifed trailer that prevented plows from removing fast-falling snow, and drivers' own wrongheaded choices."What happened was, even though the Thruway was officially closed, people went on. We didn't immediately block every entrance. It was a mistake," Cuomo said."Part of it is citizen responsibility," he added. "If the road is closed, it's closed."The storm was blamed for up to eight deaths in western New York, at least five of them from heart attacks. Erie County officials announced the latest death on Thursday, that of a man in his 60s who was stricken Wednesday while operating a snowblower.Residents of a mobile home park in the suburb of West Seneca were being evacuated Thursday after their roofs began to collapse under the weight of heavy snow.The NFL's Buffalo Bills offered $10 an hour plus game tickets for people willing to help shovel out the stands in Ralph Wilson Stadium in Orchard Park, in the snow belt southeast of the city.Team spokesman Scott Berchtold said the team has an estimated 220,000 tons of snow to remove from the stadium before Sunday's game against the Jets - more than ever before.Sunny skies returned to some hard-hit areas Wednesday, but workers were still trying to cart off the acres of snow. Lake-effect snow fell heavily on some northern New York areas east of Lake Ontario.With an additional 2 feet possible on Thursday, the one-week totals for the hardest hit areas will approach the average snowfall for an entire year: 93.6 inches, or close to 8 feet. It won't stick around, though. With temperatures expected to rise above freezing on Saturday and approach 60 by Monday, flooding is likely to produce the next challenge.The highest snowfall total for the Buffalo area this time was 65 inches, recorded in Cheektowaga. National Weather Service meteorologist David Church said forecasters haven't determined yet how this storm ranks, but that 60 to 70 inches in 24 hours is probably in the top 5 for the region.The heaviest 24-hour snowfall on record in the Lower 48 states is 75.8 inches, which fell at Silver Lake, Colorado, in 1921, according to the government.---Associated Press writer Michael Hill contributed from Albany.

http://news.yahoo.com/column-ronaldo-messi-yawn-neuer-ballon-dor-160949964.html	Column: Ronaldo? Messi? Yawn. Neuer is Ballon d'Or	PARIS (AP) — Ronaldo, Messi, Messi, Messi, Messi, Ronaldo.Yawn.Time for a new winner of the Ballon d'Or.Why? Because football is not and must not become solely about forwards. Because even its two best forwards aren't one-man shows and depend on the teams behind them. And because it would cheapen the sport's most coveted individual prize to reward them again — for a seventh consecutive time — in this year of a World Cup that neither won.Manuel Neuer — the other player-of-the-year finalist with those superstars who need no first-name introductions — should get the gong not only to snap football out of monochromatic Messi-Ronaldo tunnel vision but because the Germany and Bayern Munich goalkeeper deserves it on his own merits.At a World Cup where goalkeepers often stole the show, Neuer was still heads and shoulders above the rest. Germany wouldn't have been world champions in Brazil without his Golden Glove-winning play. 'Play' being the proper word for the 'keeper who does so much more than just keep goals out.View gallery FILE - The July 9, 2014 file photo shows Argentina's Lionel Messi celebrating after winning a sh …Supremely quick and agile, self-confident and brave, Neuer is making cool a position that kids, in their own matches, fill with the slowest and least athletic. Neuer's skills on the ball, his sliding tackles as good as those of any defender and his prescient read of the game belie the notion that goalkeepers aren't really footballers.Germany and Bayern can play with greater confidence higher up the pitch, harassing, dispossessing and hurting opponents in their own half, because Neuer provides comfort behind them, guarding not just his goalmouth but a 25-yard swath of turf in front and to either side of it.His exhilarating forward rushes to kick, punch, even head away danger before it gets close, and his cool ball-retention and passes from the back with both feet to put teammates into play, make him more than a mere safe pair of hands. Neuer's teammates, noted Germany coach Joachim Loew, "give the ball to him almost like he is another defender."This "sweeper-keeper" role is too risky for those without Neuer's speed of feet and thought and supreme confidence. The safer alternative would be staying closer to goal, rarely venturing out, and so avoiding missed tackles that can leave a slow-footed 'keeper in no-man's land, opening the route to goal and embarrassment. Neuer makes that plain vanilla look as outmoded as the mullet.It was Neuer, rushing from his box to smother Algeria's counter-attacks, who plugged holes in Germany's high-pressing, Swiss-cheese defense in the exhilarating 2-1 extra-time win for a World Cup quarterfinal place against France.View gallery FILE -In this Sept. 23, 2014 file photo Real's Cristiano Ronaldo holds the ball as he celebrates …In that 1-0 victory, Neuer again shone, palming away shots and earning praise — "a very, very good goalkeeper," he said — from French striker Karim Benzema.The unnerving sight of 28-year-old Neuer — 92 kilograms (203 pounds); size 47 (US/UK size 12) shoes; 1.93 meters (6-foot-3) tall — tearing forward can take an attacker's mind off goal. It will be a while before Gonzalo Higuain forgets the Neuer-ing he suffered in the World Cup final. Leaping up, knee forward, the Germany 'keeper flattened the Argentina striker as they competed for a high ball."The man's a beast," said former Motherwell, Rangers and Dundee United goalkeeper Ally Maxwell, speaking in an Associated Press phone interview. "There's probably no striker that will want to get anywhere near Manuel Neuer on a 50-50 (ball) ... When you see a guy that quick, that tall, that physically strong bearing down on you, yeah, I think probably he's going to win most 50-50s.""Neuer is the benchmark," he said. "The best in the world right now, by a long way."With Germany and at Bayern, Neuer is, of course, fortunate to be protected by formidable defenders and teammates higher up field drilled by Loew and Pep Guardiola to quickly win back the ball when they lose it.But when they switch off, Neuer's powers of concentration keep him switched on."He will make a save in the last minute of the game as brilliantly as he'll make a save in the first minute of the game," Maxwell said.Given that Ronaldo won the Champions League this year with Real Madrid, scoring a single-season record 17 goals in the process, he would be entitled to pout if he's not player of the year again. Less so Messi, after last season's failure to win a major trophy with Barcelona and a World Cup of brilliance only in fits and starts with Argentina.Still, a Ballon d'Or change would be refreshing.Football already has enough kids who want to be Ronaldo or Messi. Give them Neuer instead.___John Leicester is an international sports columnist for The Associated Press. Write to him at jleicester@ap.org or follow him at http://twitter.com/johnleicester
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/29/sleep-weight-gain-avoid-prevent_n_4659815.html?utm_hp_ref=healthy-living	10 Ways To Prevent Sleep-Related Weight Gain	By Bonnie Taub-DixCould lack of sleep be secretly sabotaging your health and weight? Sleeping the recommended seven to nine hours nightly can boost your overall health and whittle your waistline. In fact, studies have proven that sleep-deprived people consume over 500 more calories per day on average than those who got an adequate night's sleep.The link between diet and sleep can be compared to the chicken or egg problem -- which comes first? You need to eat healthfully to sleep soundly, while getting enough zzz's also encourages a healthy diet and lifestyle. Regardless of the reason for a disrupted sleep cycle, here are some tips to help you sleep easier and maybe even shed a few pounds.1 Eat A Variety Of Foods Flickr:jimlightfoot26 A study from the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine found that those who consume a large variety of foods (an indicator of a healthy diet) are more likely to sleep a healthy seven to eight hours a night. It was also found that very short sleepers (less than five hours a night) drank less water. Short sleepers (five to six hours a night) ate the most calories. 2 Boost Protein And Whole Grains Throughout The Day Flickr:Sight possible This combination will prevent your blood sugar levels from spiking, avoiding an afternoon crash. Try oatmeal and berries for breakfast, a hefty salad filled with veggies, quinoa, and beans for lunch, and lean meat or fish with veggies for dinner. 3 Have Your Evening Meal Several Hours Before Bedtime Shutterstock .Fill up on protein and B vitamins (think lean meat, dark leafy greens and whole grains), but leave time for digestion because going to bed on a full stomach will keep you awake, especially if you suffer from reflux or GERD. 4 Choose Your Bedtime Snack Carefully Shutterstock Avoid simple carbs and sugars, which can rev you up, and fats, which are slow to digest, making it harder to fall asleep. Opt for complex carbs and grains that can stimulate the release of serotonin, a chemical in your brain that makes you feel relaxed. Try a small bedtime bowl of oatmeal -- it's rich in carbs as well as melatonin, a natural sleep enhancer. 5 Find Slumber-Inducers In Your Kitchen Flickr:Jose C Silva Certain foods, like fish, yogurt and jasmine rice, can naturally help you count sheep. You might be surprised about other foods that can help sleep. 6 Sip Soothing Tea Flickr:FromSandToGlass Chamomile tea can calm you and peppermint tea may soothe an upset stomach. Sipping on a warm mug of comfort before bed can prevent overeating and unnecessary snacking while bringing its own natural benefits. 7 Nix Your Nightcap Shutterstock While alcohol may help you fall asleep quickly, it will lead to early rising or several wake-ups during the night. If your evening is filled with cheer, make sure it's several hours before you turn in. 8 Unplug Shutterstock It may be best to turn off emails, Facebook posts and tweets an hour or two before you turn down. Screen time right before bed could hamper sleep time. (Plus, the longer you're awake, the more time you have to eat!) 9 Ease Stress Flickr:mac.rj Before turning in, make a list of what you accomplished during the day and make note of what's on your to-do list for tomorrow. It may help to keep a pad and pen on your nightstand to help transfer your thoughts from your head to your paper. Knowing you've written it down will help you drift to sleep seamlessly. 10 Exercise Shutterstock For some people, a good workout can help you rest peacefully at night -- but if you work out too close to bedtime, it can keep you tossing and turning. It's important to be aware of the routine that works for you and your body.More from Everyday Health: 10 Ways to Spend Your FSA Before it Disappears 3 Dry Skin Mistakes To Stop Making Now Unbelievably Easy Fixes for Winter Hair ProblemsSleep and Weight: Why You Need to Know About It originally appeared on Everyday Health
http://news.yahoo.com/vatican-finds-hundreds-millions-euros-tucked-away-cardinal-131617994.html	Vatican finds hundreds of millions of euros 'tucked away': cardinal	VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Vatican's economy minister has said hundreds of millions of euros were found "tucked away" in accounts of various Holy See departments without having appeared in the city-state's balance sheets.In an article for Britain's Catholic Herald Magazine to be published on Friday, Australian Cardinal George Pell wrote that the discovery meant overall Vatican finances were in better shape than previously believed."In fact, we have discovered that the situation is much healthier than it seemed, because some hundreds of millions of euros were tucked away in particular sectional accounts and did not appear on the balance sheet," he wrote."It is important to point out that the Vatican is not broke ... the Holy See is paying its way, while possessing substantial assets and investments," Pell said, according to an advance text made available on Thursday.Pell did not suggest any wrongdoing but said Vatican departments had long had "an almost free hand" with their finances and followed "long-established patterns" in managing their affairs."Very few were tempted to tell the outside world what was happening, except when they needed extra help," he said, singling out the once-powerful Secretariat of State as one department that had especially jealously guarded its independence.View gallery Cardinal George Pell gestures as he talks during a news conference for the presentation of new presi …"It was impossible for anyone to know accurately what was going on overall," said Pell, head of the new Secretariat for the Economy that is independent of the now downgraded Secretariat of State.AUSTRALIAN OUTSIDERPell is an outsider from the English-speaking world transferred by Pope Francis from Sydney to Rome to oversee the Vatican's often muddled finances after decades of control by Italians.Pell's office sent a letter to all Vatican departments last month about changes in economic ethics and accountability.As of Jan. 1, each department will have to enact "sound and efficient financial management policies" and prepare financial information and reports that meet international accounting standards.Each department's financial statements will be reviewed by a major international auditing firm, the letter said.Since the pope's election in March, 2013, the Vatican has enacted major reforms to adhere to international financial standards and prevent money laundering. It has closed many suspicious accounts at its scandal-rocked bank.In his article, Pell said the reforms were "well under way and already past the point where the Vatican could return to the 'bad old days'."(Reporting By Philip Pullella; Editing by Tom Heneghan)

But instead of showing the actual surgical shots, Cyrus (and then her fans) photoshopped the images to make them (slightly) less graphic. It’s hard to explain, but check out the photos below, if you’re so inclined.The singer, who has not tweeted in weeks, posted the pics on Instagram. She did not explain what was being done to her arm, although a number of fans have speculated that it was a simple cyst removal. Cyrus shared a picture of herself (see right), captioned, “The gown is sooooo hipster.”She also posted a fairly graphic picture of her cut-open wrist (see below), with a tiny smiley face superimposed over the wound. Cyrus later shared a number of different fan-made versions of the shot, including one with Justin Bieber’s face and another with a slice of pizza.Cyrus recently celebrated her 22nd birthday with boyfriend Patrick Schwarzenegger, dancing topless and riding a mechanical dildo at a club in Hollywood. Her relationship with Schwarzenegger and their recent visit to Art Basel in Miami have made headlines in the tabloids, as have a number of totally false pregnancy rumors. Hopefully Cyrus is feeling well after whatever needed to be done to her wrist on Friday. See the pictures below.(Instagram)(Instagram)(Instagram)(Instagram)(Instagram)(Instagram)

Amanda Bynes took out nap outside of a Bloomingdales in L.A. on Thursday. (WENN.com)No, that wasn't Goldilocks snoozing outside Bloomingdales at the Beverly Center in L.A. on Thursday. It was Amanda Bynes — and, according to the actress, it was all her parents' fault.The troubled 28-year-old, who recently revealed that she suffers from bipolar disorder, was photographed looking worse for wear napping on a mall couch. She had on red sweatpants and rubber sandals, a black jacket and sunglasses as she conked out among the shoppers.After learning she was photographed, the Hairspray star  took to Twitter to explain the sad sight and placed the blame on the ongoing battle she's fighting against her parents, Lynn and Rick Bynes.I was not given money for a hotel so i have been staying with friends and i didn't get enough sleep last night so I fell asleep on a couch— amanda bynes (@amandabynes) November 6, 2014@ the beverly center and a paparazzi snuck in and took pictures of me FYI ! I hate my parents for still not giving me money for a hotel— amanda bynes (@amandabynes) November 6, 2014What is wrong with them? My lawyer is working to have them fully removed from being my conservator, because they don't deserve control over— amanda bynes (@amandabynes) November 6, 2014my money - They are miserable in their life and I will fight to get control of my finances taken away from them !— amanda bynes (@amandabynes) November 6, 2014Bynes's battle with her parents is a nasty one. Her mother was once again appointed conservator of Amanda's estate and finances after convincing a judge that the former All That star was incapable of overseeing her money. (They claimed she was throwing away her $5 million fortune, buying strangers on the street Cartier jewelry and other gifts.) Meanwhile, Amanda has accused her father of physical abuse on multiple occasions.Lynn and Rick, who were photographed packing up their L.A. home in advance of a move back to Texas, are now working to hire a third party to act as Amanda's conservator and be responsible for her daily needs.View gallery. Lynn and Rick Bynes have been packing up their L.A. home and will reportedly move to Texas. (Splash News)"Her parents love her so much that they are willing to relinquish this little bit of control," a source told People of Amanda, who was released from a psychiatric hold on Oct. 30 against her parents' wishes. "Her mother being conservator is not doing her any good and Amanda is not progressing. They want someone she will respond to and work with. A professional conservator can live with her, have constant access to her and is equipped to deal with everything in a less emotional way."A lawyer for Lynn wouldn't comment on the situation to Yahoo.Until that new conservator is in place, Bynes's parents are giving her gift cards for her daily expenses, according to TMZ. So she has no cash, but has American Express gift certiicates in the amounts of $50 or $100 a day, to live off of.To make ends meet, Bynes reportedly wants to get a job as a bartender, according to the website.Amanda has reportedly had several offers of a place to stay other than a mall couch. One of those came from limelight loving Heidi Montag of The Hills fame. No word if Amanda reached out to her, but we are doubtful that would better the seemingly unstable star's situation.But at this point, it's clear Amanda needs all the help she can get. Fingers crossed she gets it before it's too late.

It's also looking for conditions favourable for life; not now, but in the past, when Mars may have been home to extraterrestrial microbes.But maybe the answer is right here on Earth, after all -- in the form of a meteorite.Tissint landed in the desert of Guelmim-Es Semara, Morocco, on July 18, 2011. It was thrown from the surface of Mars by an asteroid collision some 700,000 years ago -- and there is no other meteorite quite like it. The 7-11 kilogram grey rock -- seared glassy black on the outside by the heat of entry, called a fusion crust -- showed evidence of water. It was riddled with tiny fissures, into which water had deposited material.This material, on analysis, turned out to be an organic carbon compound -- one that was biological in origin. It is not the only meteorite in which organic carbon has been found, but the debate has always centered on whether the carbon was deposited before or after the meteorite in question landed on Earth -- to wit, whether it is terrestrial or extraterrestrial in origin.A team of researchers studied the organic carbon found in the fissures of Tissint and determined that it is not of this world.There are several points of evidence put forward by the team. First, there was a relatively short timeframe between when the meteorite was observed falling to Earth and when it was collected.The second is that the microscopic fissures in the rock would have had to have been produced by a sudden high heat -- such as, for example, the heat of atmospheric entry. This shock, and the temperatures required to open the fissures, could not have come from the Moroccan desert.Thirdly, some of the carbon grains inside Tissint had hardened into diamond. There are no known conditions under which this could have occurred on the surface of the Moroccan desert -- and certainly not in the time it took between the meteorite's fall and discovery.A piece of Tissint, showing the glassy fusion crust and grey interior. Alain Herzog/École polytechnique fédérale de LausanneFourthly, the carbon contains a high amount of deuterium, heavy hydrogen with one proton and one neutron in its nucleus -- consistent with the composition of Mars geology. "Such an enormous concentration of deuterium is the typical 'finger print' of Martian rocks as we know already from previous measurements," study co-author Professor Ahmed El Goresy of the University of Bayreuth, Germany, said.These points are supported by the nanoscale secondary ion mass spectroscopy data. This reveals that the material was significantly depleted of carbon isotope 13C, compared to the level of 13C in the carbon dioxide of Mars' atmosphere as measured by Phoenix and Curiosity. This difference was consistent with the levels found on Earth between the atmosphere and a piece of coal -- which is biological in origin.While the case looks strong, though, it would be a mistake to consider the evidence conclusive just yet, cautioned Yangting Lin, the study's senior author and professor at the Institute of Geology and Geophysics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing."We cannot and do not want to entirely exclude the possibility that organic carbon within Tissint may be of abiotic origin," Lin wrote, meaning the carbon maybe physical in origin rather than organic -- devoid of life."It could be possible that the organic carbon originated from impacts of carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. However, it is not easy to conceive by which processes chondritic carbon could have been selectively extracted from the impacting carbonaceous chondrites, selectively removed from the soil and later impregnated in the extremely fine rock veins."The full study, "NanoSIMS analysis of organic carbon from the Tissint Martian meteorite: Evidence for the past existence of subsurface organic-bearing fluids on Mars", can be found online in the journal Meteoritics & Planetary Science.

The pair were photographed holding hands, and the music manager put an arm around Jenner's shoulder as they put their belongings in order."What started off as a friendship has turned romantic, but it's all very new," a source told E! News of the couple.Jenner and Gamble met at Givenchy designer Riccardo Tisci's birthday party in August, and were seen having dinner in mid-October. The couple were spotted a week later at Kim Kardashian's birthday bash in Las Vegas."He's a really great guy," another source said of Gamble. "He's so nice and a very responsible man. He doesn't drink or party. He is very caring about other people and generally just an all around good guy."Jenner filed for divorce from husband Bruce Jenner on September 22. The couple had been married since 1991, and separated since October 2013. Bruce Jenner has since been linked to Jenner's best friend, Ronda Kamihira.
http://news.yahoo.com/florida-woman-found-dead-arrows-head-205015049.html	Florida woman found dead with arrows in head	MARY ESTHER, Fla. (AP) — A Florida man told police he shot his mother with a gun and a bow-and-arrow and then stabbed her Sunday because he claimed she "stole his diamonds and also gave his father cancer," authorities said.The Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office received a call at 2:48 a.m. Sunday reporting a man knocking over Christmas decorations and yelling at another person. When deputies arrived, they found 65-year-old Gloria Watkins slumped forward in a chair with arrows protruding from her head.Her son, Michael Watkins, 42, admitted to the killing, according to an arrest report."You see that, that's death," Watkins said as he pointed to his mother, according to the report.Watkins claimed his mother "stole his diamonds and also gave his father cancer" and that "he had to kill her because she was trying to kill him," the report said. The report did not say why or how she was trying to kill him.Watkins was charged with murder and resisting arrest without violence. The sheriff's office said Watkins ignored repeated commands to get on the ground. After eventually complying, he stood up and retrieved a large knife from a sheath on his belt, authorities said.Deputies used stun guns on Watkins twice.An autopsy was to be conducted on the victim. It's not clear if Watkins has an attorney. Officials with the jail and the sheriff's office could not be reached.

"Silent Night" cruised to victory in the final matchup, besting "Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer" by a 50 percent margin. Congrats to users Allaman3, gardenmama, and jodyann07 whose prediction brackets came in first, second, and third respectively. Thanks to everyone who voted. The next big question, of course, is which version of "Silent Night" do you love the most? Be sure to tell us about it in the comments.UPDATE December 22: Final four ends and final matchup begins The final four saw powerhouse songs get knocked out. "Silent Night" knocked out the classic ballad "White Christmas" and "Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer" bested Elvis Presley's "Blue Christmas." UPDATE December 20: Round 4 Voting in Christmas Song Madness ends Round 4 saw "Silent Night" knock out "O Holy Night" and "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" push "Let It Snow" out of contention, but it was "White Christmas" that saw the biggest win, besting "I'll Be Home For Christmas" with more than two-thirds of the vote. But that win won't be a shock for anyone who knows that Bing Crosby's "White Christmas" holds the title of best selling single record of all-time, according to Guinness World Records.The tightest race came between anther Crosby hit, his "Little Drummer Boy/Peace On Earth" duet with David Bowie. That tune held a solid 14-point lead for most of round 4, but Elvis Presley's fans came out in full force in the final hours, and "Blue Christmas" ultimately overcame to win by a tiny 2 percent margin.UPDATE December 18: Round 3 Voting in Christmas Song Madness endsAs three rounds of Christmas Song Madness ended we said goodbye to hits like "Joy To The World," "O, Come All Ye Faithful," and "All I Want For Christmas Is You.""Frosty the Snowman" lost in the tightest race of round 3, only 200 votes behind "Let It Snow," which advanced to our "Elite Eight" round to go head-to-head with "Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer."At this point in the tournament, we had some big names matching up, and the decisions were bound to get harder. Would the David Bowie and Bing Crosby version of "The Little Drummer Boy/Peace On Earth" beat Elvis Presley's classic "Blue Christmas"? And how will inspirational favorite "Silent Night" do when up against "O Holy Night"?UPDATE December 16: Round 2 Voting in Christmas Song Madness endsRound 2 saw Mariah Carey's 20-year-old modern classic "All I Want For Christmas Is You" get knocked off by Elvis Presley's version of "Blue Christmas" with Presley's 1957 hit knocking Carey's 1994 love song off 69.6 percent to 30.4 percent.The tightest race of round 2 came between "Mary, Did You Know?" and "Feliz Navidad," with the former squeaking by the latter by fewer than 100 votes. The second closest race was won by "O, Come All Ye Faithful," which snagged 51.8 percent of the vote to knock out "The Little Drummer Boy." But at least one version of "The Little Drummer Boy" is still alive, as the David Bowie and Bing Crosby version of the song - mixed with "Peace On Earth" - managed to beat out the bluesy Christmas tune "Please Come Home For Christmas.""Silent Night" continued its run as a fan favorite, moving onto round 3 with a 55-point win over "Angels We Have Heard On High," but the biggest blowout of round 2 went to "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer," which nabbed a massive 79-point margin of victory over "I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas." Sorry, hippos. Better luck next time.UPDATE December 13: Round 1 Voting in Christmas Song Madness endsMariah Carey's 20-year-old modern classic "All I Want For Christmas Is You" carried her to victory with 68.4 percent of the vote against Paul McCartney's 1979 "Wonderful Christmastime" in round 1. Mariah will have her work cut out for her in round two. She'll square off against Elvis Presley's 1957 version of "Blue Christmas," which easily dispatched John Lennon's 1971 "Happy Christmas (War is Over)" in a landslide, claiming nearly 80 percent of the vote in a round one match-up.Other notable outcomes in the first round included "Jingle Bells" narrowly falling to "Winter Wonderland," 51.1 percent to 48.9 percent. In the tightest first-round match-up, "Santa Baby" barely edged "The Chipmunk Song," 50.6 percent to 49.4 percent. And in the first round's most lopsided contest, "Silent Night," a heavy favorite to go all the way, clobbered "Once In Royal David's City," 92.8 percent to 7.2 percent.Whether you're hearing them at the mall or on the radio, the holiday season means Christmas songs are wafting through your ears and getting stuck in your heads. We're getting into the spirit this year by bringing a little springtime tradition to the Christmas season with a March Madness style competition that pits Christmas songs against each other -- and you'll get to the decide the winner.We've amassed a list of 64 of the most popular and fun Christmas songs, and we're putting them all head-to-head, round-by-round until we finally crown America's Favorite Christmas Song. Vote for your favorite songs in the bracket below, then come back to keep voting each day. Along the way, you'll learn interesting trivia about all the songs in the tournament. (Check out some fascinating tidbits just below the bracket.)Did you know the original lyrics to 'O Holy Night,' were penned by Placide Cappeau de Roquemaure at the behest of a parish priest of southern France in 1847? Cappeau, a well-known one-handed businessman and poet, was either an 'avowed atheist' or a rare churchgoer -- depending on which account you believe -- but he's generally believed to be a casual Christian at best. Meanwhile, the man he commissioned to write the music for the beloved Christian carol, Adolphe Charles Adams, was Jewish. (Look below the bracket for the rest of the story.)When the church made this discovery, leaders weren't pleased. As Ace Collins explains in his book, 'Stories Behind the Best-Loved Songs of Christmas' eventually church leaders became so concerned about the "total absence of the spirit of religion" that they tried to ban the hymn, but the French people already loved it and wouldn't stop singing the song.That's far from the only amazing fact about a Christmas carol. "White Christmas" is the best-selling single of all time, according to Guinness World Records. 'The Christmas Song' -- or 'Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire' as most probably remember it -- was purportedly written during a heat wave by a lyricist trying to conjure up thoughts of cooler weather.Which tune will claim the championship title of Best Christmas Song? Only you and your fellow voters can decide, but the AOL editors went on the record with their predictions about which song will come out on top -- and we definitely don't all agree.We also had more songs we loved that we just couldn't squeeze into the 64-song bracket.

http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Ant-Man-Most-Important-Movie-Marvel-Cinematic-Universe-Here-Why-68112.html	Ant-Man Will Be The Most Important Movie In The Marvel Cinematic Universe, Here's Why	When Edgar Wright left the Ant-Man project earlier this summer, the alleged straw that broke the camel's back was a surprise re-write that fixed two problems Marvel had with the last draft that Wright and co-writer Joe Cornish had turned in. Those two "problems" were that the film's "core morality" as well as "franchise characters" not getting enough love by the current standards of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. For those of us who wanted to see Edgar Wright's unfettered, unaltered Ant-Man, we'll probably never get the chance to even the now fabled draft. So what does that leave us with?Well, details have been slowly leaking out, sketching out the film's possible and confirmed trajectories in plot and character development. It sounds like the morality of the picture might be "improved," and the representation of pre-existing Marvel Cinematic Universe characters has been more than fortified. In fact, everything that's out there right now, both rumor and fact, has us thinking that Ant-Man is going to be the most important Marvel Studios picture in the entire MCU, connecting not only to the present and future of the entire operation at hand; but also filling in some essential blanks in the past.In the comic history of The Avengers, Hank Pym's Ant-Man was one of the first members of the team, and judging by the 2012 film introduction to Earth's mightiest heroes, you wouldn't know it. However, Marvel seems to be correcting this error with some fancy retcon work in Ant-Man. In addition to Hank Pym being named one of the "founding" Avengers, he also looks like he'll be interacting with two favorites of the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Peggy Carter and Howard Stark.While we've seen Peggy and Howard during the 1940's, the 50's onward are a bit of a haze. Agent Carter will fill in the gaps that come after Captain America: The First Avenger, ending at some assumed point in the 1960's - 1970's, at the very least 1974. Why '74? Because that's when the Stark Expo hosted by Howard Stark, takes place, and since John Slattery is back in the saddle as Howard Stark, this all makes sense. While "The Avengers Initiative" may not have been deployed until 2012, its beginnings are clearly linked to the formation of the SSR and S.H.I.E.L.D. So don't be surprised if young Hank Pym shows up alongside young Anton Vanko in Howard Stark's lab on Agent Carter.
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/houston-texans-quarterback-insane-throwing-141727867.html	The Houston Texans' New Quarterback Has An Insane Throwing Arm	David J. Phillip/AP Ryan Mallett hasn't had much of a chance to prove himself in the NFL. After serving three years as Tom Brady's backup in New England, Mallett was traded to the Houston Texans, for whom he will make his first start Sunday against the Cleveland Browns.Mallett, who replaces Ryan Fitzpatrick at starter, has played in just five NFL games, usually wrapping up blowouts. He has thrown four passes for 17 yards and an interception. He is unproven, but he will get a chance to show what he can do in Week 11.The Texans can look forward to the chance to see Mallett's throwing arm, which was legendary when he was in high school. Tania Ganguli's ESPN profile on Mallett describes Mallett's long bombs in high school:In high school, [Mallett] threw the ball 88 yards at an Elite 11 camp. Many assumed the wind must have aided him. A few days later, throwing for a magazine story, he made it 86 yards. That time there was no doubt. [Boston Red Sox third basemen Will] Middlebrooks has seen him kneel at midfield and shoot the football through the uprights of the goalpost 60 yards away. That arm was part of what caused [Mallett's high school offensive coordinator] to invite Mallett to throw with the varsity team when he was in eighth grade. Mallett's arm got recognition in college, too, when ESPN's Sports Science did a segment on him, concluding his throws could reach speeds of 65 miles per hour.  The Browns are aware of Mallett's arm and are already preparing. Head coach Mike Pettine said the Browns "know he has a great arm," adding that they are anticipating deep, downfield shots. Browns running back Ben Tate played for Mallett's Southeastern Conference rival Auburn in college and also noted the former Arkansas Razorback's throwing ability, saying:  "He's got a strong arm. Very, very strong arm. He can sling that thing around."Browns quarterback Brian Hoyer, who spent a season as a backup in New England with Mallet, upped the praise even more. "Strongest arm I've ever seen, and I really do mean that," he said. The Texans have two highly talented wide receivers in Andre Johnson and DeAndre Hopkins and a top running back in Arian Foster. If Mallett can combine accuracy with his strength, the Texans offense may be able to put a lot of points on the board Sunday.More From Business InsiderNFL POWER RANKINGS: Where Every Team Stands Going Into Week 11 NFL QUARTERBACK POWER RANKINGS: Where All 32 Starters Stand Going Into Week 10 The Microsoft Engine That Nailed The World Cup Is Predicting Every NFL Game — Here Are Its Picks For Week 11

http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/05/29/food-fight-tyson-foods-pilgrims-pride-hillshire-brands-pinnacle-foods/9719463/	What's behind the food frenzy?	The ongoing food frenzy comes down to this: buy or be bought."Think of it as a Pac Man for companies," says Michael Silverstein, senior partner at the Boston Consulting Group. If you don't swallow someone else, they may swallow you.Perhaps that's why even giant Tyson Foods got into the melee Thursday when it offered $50 a share — about $6.8 billion — in an all-cash deal to purchase Hillshire Brands, which makes Jimmy Dean sausage and Ball Park hot dogs. Earlier this week, Pilgrim's Pride offered about $6.4 billion for Hillshire. Never mind that earlier this month, in a possible move to thwart Pilgrim's Pride, Hillshire bid $4.2 billion for Pinnacle Foods.Some major drivers behind the ongoing food fight are:• Demand for growth. It's extremely expensive to create and grow new brands — particularly food brands. It's much cheaper to grow by purchasing a company with familiar brands. "They're looking to buy market share rather than build it," says David Lewis, senior vice president at the Astec Analytics division at SunGard Financial Systems.• Desire to cut costs. When one company talks about "synergies" with another that typically means cost-cutting. The combined food companies can pay less for commodities, transportation and packaging, says Silverstein, "because they have more market power."• Aim for cheap financing. Interest rates are so low right now that it's easier and cheaper to finance big deals with debt than at just about any other time, notes Gary Stibel, CEO of the New England Consulting Group.• Lust for scale. Bigger food makers have more power with retailers and suppliers, Stibel says. "To hold on to your seat at the table with Wal-Mart, you'd better have scale."• Opportunity to expand. Many food makers are eager to expand into adjacent categories "to build awareness across different areas of packaged food," says Farha Aslam, managing director at Stephens Inc.• Desire to be defensive. Some food makers want their lead — or to stop certain competitors from gaining market share, Aslam says.• Urge to merge. Amid the nation's estimated 13,000 food companies, there fewer than 1,000 that are true takeover, merger or acquisition targets, Silverstein says. Uniqueness of brand or product makes them targets. And the universe, he notes, is contracting.• Need to feed egos. CEOs of major food companies know they'll be remembered for one of two things: the products they create or companies they acquire, Silverstein says. The latter is easier than the former.• Chance to shine. For many consumers, protein, the chief food category involved in these current merger talks, is back on-trend, Stibel says. Now, for example, there are more nutritionally-focused offerings like antibiotic-free meats. "Protein is no longer the big, bad dude," he says.Read or Share this story: http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/05/29/food-fight-tyson-foods-pilgrims-pride-hillshire-brands-pinnacle-foods/9719463/

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/espn-anchor-stuart-scott-died-145158463.html	ESPN Anchor Stuart Scott Has Died	ESPN anchor Stuart Scott has passed away at the age of 49.Here's the statement from ESPN.Stuart Scott, a dedicated family man and one of ESPN’s signature SportsCenter anchors, has died after a courageous and inspiring battle with cancer. He was 49.Scott is survived by his two daughters, Taelor, 19, and Sydni, 15; his parents, O. Ray and Jacqueline Scott; and his three siblings Stephen Scott, Synthia Kearney, Susan Scott and their families. His girlfriend, Kristin Spodobalski, was with Stuart and cared for him every step of the way and along with support from his loving family, close friends and colleagues, he went through several surgeries, chemotherapy, radiation and clinical trials to stay strong and ward off cancer for as long as humanly possible.“ESPN and everyone in the sports world have lost a true friend and a uniquely inspirational figure in Stuart Scott,” said ESPN president John Skipper. “Who engages in mixed martial arts training in the midst of chemotherapy treatments? Who leaves a hospital procedure to return to the set? His energetic and unwavering devotion to his family and to his work while fighting the battle of his life left us in awe, and he leaves a void that can never be replaced.”On July 16, 2014, Scott accepted the Jimmy V Perseverance Award at the ESPYs. During his speech, he expressed the following sentiment about his two daughters: “Taelor and Sydni, I love you guys more than I will ever be able to express. You two are my heartbeat. I am standing on this stage here tonight because of you.”During his ESPY speech, Scott shared his approach to fighting cancer. “I also realized something else recently,” he said. “I said, I’m not losing. I’m still here. I’m fighting. I’m not losing. But I’ve got to amend that. When you die, that does not mean that you lose to cancer. You beat cancer by how you live, why you live, and the manner in which you live. So live. Live. Fight like hell.”For 21 years, years Scott was one of ESPN’s and ABC Sports’ most recognizable and quotable personalities and one of the most popular sportscasters around the world. His catchphrases, including his most famous “Boo-ya” and “As cool as the other side of the pillow,” have become an integral part of pop culture. While Scott became instantly known for his enthusiasm and colorful descriptions, he was always proud of the facts he would weave into his storytelling, recognizing that every great story is based in fact.After joining the network in 1993 for the launch of ESPN2, Scott became a leading voice on ESPN’s SportsCenter, where he anchored the 11pm show. Over the years, his talent and work ethic led to many additional high-profile assignments including major hosting roles on NFL and NBA programming.

Scott also hosted numerous ESPN and ABC series and specials, including Dream Job, Stump The Schwab, ESPN’s 25th Anniversary Special, and The ESPY Red Carpet Show.In addition to this busy TV schedule, Scott had also worked as a regular contributor to ESPN: The Magazine, ESPN Radio, and ESPN.com.Scott was featured in countless This is SportsCenter commercials, which he so enjoyed.Most recently, Scott was in the anchor chair alongside his longtime partner, Steve Levy, when ESPN re-launched SportsCenter on a new set.Scott not only interviewed most of the world’s top athletes, he interviewed top celebrities, newsmakers, and politicians. Stuart interviewed and played a televised game of one-on-one basketball with President Barack Obama, one of his two interviews with the President, and conducted numerous one-on-one interviews with the likes of Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan, Denzel Washington and President Clinton.Hollywood and Madison Avenue also took notice of Scott’s wide appeal; he was featured in numerous high-profile commercial campaigns. He appeared on many TV shows, sitcoms, feature films and music videos and was parodied in a Saturday Night Live skit.Over the years, Scott earned numerous awards and honors. He was recently honored with the NABJ Award of Merit, received a Rammy Award which pays tribute to superlative performances in athletics, academics and sports from his beloved alma mater, UNC-Chapel Hill, and was a guest of honor at the 14th annual “An Evening with Heroes” celebration in Indianapolis, which benefits the Heroes Foundation. In 2011 he was honored by The V Foundation with “The Spirit of Jimmy V Award.” He was instrumental in raising hundreds of thousands of dollars for The V Foundation, Livestrong, and participated in Stand Up To Cancer campaigns as well donating time to raise awareness and funds for numerous other charities.He always said a personal and professional highlight for him came in 2004, when he was requested by U.S. soldiers to be a part of “ESPN’s SportsCenter: Salute the Troops” effort, in which he and fellow anchors hosted a week of programs originating in Kuwait.Prior to joining ESPN, Scott worked at local stations in Orlando, Florida; Raleigh, North Carolina and Florence, South Carolina.

He met the challenge as he did everything in his life – with determination, a courageous fighting spirit and an always positive attitude that impacted and inspired everyone who knew him.In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made to The V Foundation (www.jimmyv.org).

Nothing good can come of it. Via Cleveland.com:Midway through the third, Harris was going to work on James in the mid-post area and to create some separation; he flung his elbows around in the vicinity of James' face. James backed up to avoid the connection, but he took exception and said something to Harris. The two jawed back and forth at one another and had to be separated. While walking away, Harris yelled, "Stop flopping." ... From that point on James dominated Harris, going 5-of-7 in the final 17 minutes. He scored 15 of his game-high 29 points in the fourth. After that alteration with James, Harris only scored one point. He finished with 17 points on 6-of-12.Total badass quote by LeBron: "I was actually in chill mode tonight but chill mode was deactivated after that."Damn.(Vine via @bencelestino)
http://news.yahoo.com/ted-cruz-just-did-huge-214002995.html	Ted Cruz just did a huge favor for Democrats	The Senate unexpectedly stayed in session for several hours on Saturday before voting on a bill to fund the government through next September (the "CRomnibus"). The Saturday session was forced late Friday night by Senators Ted Cruz and Mike Lee, who are upset over the Obama administration's executive actions on immigration. They refused to allow Congress to go into recess without a vote on the constitutionality of Obama's actions. The Senate voted down Cruz and Lee's motion on immigration — with several Republicans joining Democrats — before it passed the CRomnibus. Because of the extra time, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was able to move closer to votes on 24 Obama administration nominees — including nominees for Surgeon General, the head of the country's chief immigration enforcement agency, and twelve federal judgeships — who Republican senators have been blocking.Why is the Senate in session over the weekend?The Senate needed to pass something by midnight Saturday night to prevent the federal government from running out of money and shutting down.On Friday night, the Senate was supposed to pass a bill funding the government through Wednesday. Then, they would adjourn for the weekend, and come back on Monday to pass the $1.1 trillion "CRomnibus": the bill to fund most of the government through September, 2015.This plan got worked out by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on Friday. The way the Senate works, votes need to be scheduled a certain number of hours in advance, in order to "ripen" — but under the terms of the deal, senators would agree to waive the waiting period in order to get the short-term bill passed Friday night. The problem is that waiving the waiting period requires unanimous consent of all 100 senators.Why did Ted Cruz and Mike Lee block the plan on Friday?Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Mike Lee (R-UT) took to the Senate floor late Friday night to call for an immediate vote to stop President Obama's recent executive actions on immigration. Under the deal that Reid and McConnell worked out, Republicans would bring up a "constitutional point of order" on Monday that would register the Senate's belief that the President's executive actions are unconstitutional. But Lee and Cruz wanted a vote on the point of order immediately.Reid refused to give them the vote. As a result, they refused to consent to the procedural plan Reid and McConnell had worked out. No unanimous consent meant that the waiting period applied again, and the Senate had to stay in session through the weekend to allow the votes to happen as scheduled.Congressional expert Sarah Binder of the Brookings Institution describes the result as "full bloom procedural nuttiness." But it's also, she notes, a demonstration of what happens when you can't get all 100 senators to go along with a plan: "the Senate doesn't work very well when Senators refuse to cooperate."How did the Senate get itself out of this mess?On Saturday night,Reid, Cruz, and others worked out an agreement to let them go home earlier.Under that agreement, the Senate voted on the point of order Cruz wanted.  It failed, 22 to 74. Then, the Senate took a final vote on the CRomnibus — which passed 56 to 40.Were other Republicans on board with Cruz and Lee?Many of them weren't on board with the plan to keep the Senate in session — not least Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. McConnell wanted to allow the Senate to adjourn for the weekend — in fact, according to Politico, he'd already left the Capitol on Friday when all this went down.As a matter of fact, when the Senate voted on Cruz and Lee's motion on Saturday, 20 Republicans joined Democrats in voting against it — not because they support President Obama's actions on immigration, but to show their disapproval of Cruz and Lee's tactics. That included not only McConnell, but Cruz's fellow Texas Senator John Cornyn and Lee's fellow Utah Senator Orrin Hatch.What does this have to do with nominees?Republicans have been blocking lots of Obama nominees for the executive branch and federal judgeships. Reid and Senate Democrats wanted to get a chance to approve a couple dozen nominations before leaving for the year, and coming back to a Republican-controlled Senate.When the Senate stayed in session on Saturday, Reid had a chance to go into executive session — which is what the Senate does to confirm nominees — and file for cloture on 24 nominations. That will give those nominations time to ripen sooner.If the Senate had been out of session over the weekend, and then come back Monday to pass the CRomnibus, Reid would have had to schedule votes on nominees for later next week.Cruz's office says that this means the weekend session didn't change anything. "Everyone knows Harry Reid planned to jam forward as many nominees as he could after the omnibus passed," said Cruz's deputy press secretary. "He made this clear to members last week, and his spokesperson confirmed so publicly."However, according to Politico, Republican leadership was betting that lame-duck Democrats wouldn't want to stick around for all those votes. So they thought that they might be able to take control of the Senate before those nominations got approved.But now, Reid can schedule votes that will have the time to ripen by the beginning of the week. At this rate, they'll be able to start voting for cloture on the nominees on Monday.Who are the nominees in question?It's a mix of judicial appointments and executive picks.The highest-profile nomination is Surgeon General nominee Vivek Murthy, who is opposed by the NRA because he's called gun violence a public health issue. There's also a nominee to lead Immigration and Customs Enforcement — the government's chief immigration agency — who Republicans oppose because of their opposition to President Obama's recent executive actions on immigration.UPDATE: This article was updated with a comment from the office of Senator Cruz, about the effect of the weekend session on nominations.More from vox.com:How politics makes us stupid Beating the odds: How a bill becomes a law in 2014 7 reasons the Democratic coalition is more united than ever Who really matters in our democracy — the public, or wealthy elites?
http://money.cnn.com/2015/08/19/technology/tech-destroys-creates-jobs/index.html?iid=ob_homepage_money_pool&iid=obnetwork	The jobs that are most threatened by technology	Routine-based jobs may be most threatened by technology, new research from Deloitte suggests.If history repeats itself, most of us won't have to worry about technology killing off our jobs.For a century and a half, computers, machines and robots have created more jobs than they have destroyed, according to new research published this week.Economists at Deloitte studied employment records in England and Wales for every decade since 1871. They also analyzed labor data from 1992.Researchers Ian Stewart, Debapratim De and Alex Cole found that jobs that require a routine have declined the most because they can be easily substituted by technology.Among them:-- Footwear and leather working jobs, which have declined 82% since 1992.-- Weavers and knitters (-79%)-- Metal making and treating process operators (-70%)-- Typists and related keyboard occupations (-57%)-- Secretaries (-52%)-- Energy plant workers (-51%)-- Farm workers (-50%)-- Metal machine setters and setter-operators (-44%)Non-routine jobs, on the other hand, have exploded."Technology is highly complementary to cognitive, non-routine tasks...[and] there is little opportunity to apply technology in non-routine manual tasks, such as those done by care home workers."Specifically, the independent study found that the number of nursing jobs skyrocketed 909% since 1992. Teaching jobs ballooned 580%.Other industries that have benefited significantly:-- Management consultants and business analysts (+365%)-- I.T. managers (+195%)-- Welfare, housing, youth and community workers (+183%)-- Care workers and home carers (+168%)-- Actors, dancers, entertainment hosts, producers and directors (+156%)-- Financial managers (+132%)The Deloitte researchers admit they can't predict the jobs of the future, but it's likely that the in-demand tasks will require more social interaction, empathy and creativity."Machines will take on more repetitive and laborious tasks, but seem no closer to eliminating the need for human labor than at any time in the [past]," they concluded. "We believe that jobs will continue to be created, enhanced and destroyed much as they have in the last 150 years."This study was first reported by The Guardian.The report is part of a growing amount of data and research on the topic of tech's impact on jobs.Amy Webb, a digital media futurist, recently predicted at least eight careers "ripe for disruption" in the next 10 to 20 years.She called out factory workers and phone operators, but also journalists, lawyers, and financial middle men in the banking, escrow, insurance and mortgage sectors.A Brookings Institution report published earlier this summer offers another perspective -- that a pattern may not be so clear."There is, as yet, essentially no visible relationship between the use of robots and the change in manufacturing employment," the Brookings researchers wrote. They say broader economic factors are at play.Related: July jobs report -- 215,000 addedRelated: The fight over middle-class jobs and free tradeRelated: The machines are not taking your job

http://www.aol.com/article/2014/03/15/missing-malaysian-airlines-jet-nets-high-ratings-on-cable-news/20850540/	Missing Malaysian Airlines jet nets high ratings on cable news	AP Television WriterNEW YORK (AP) -- The mystery of the missing Malaysian Airlines jet has become a hot television story, particularly on CNN.The network devoted the bulk of its time Friday to the story, a direct result of ratings showing a fascination among viewers about the Boeing 777 airliner that has been missing since taking off from a Kuala Lumpur airport a week ago.CNN averaged 588,000 viewers for the full day Thursday, well above its average of 320,000 this year. Anderson Cooper's prime-time show, which has focused heavily on the mystery, more than doubled its typical viewership the last two nights and topped 1.1 million viewers Thursday.The network tracked various theories Friday, a headline on its screen identifying the story as "Vanished." Correspondent Martin Savidge did several reports from a cockpit simulator, Wolf Blitzer discussed whether the recording of a seismic event in the region on the day the plane took off could be tied to a crash and security experts continued to mull potential terrorism.It has become a water cooler topic, with several social media references to the downed jet that kicked off the popular television series "Lost."Cooper's show, which has averaged 444,000 viewers this year, reached 972,000 people on Wednesday, Nielsen said. On both of the last two nights, Cooper achieved the highly unusual feat of topping Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly among the 25- to 54-year-old age demographic. O'Reilly easily won among viewers of all ages.So far, the plane story has meant less for Fox and MSNBC, which have a heavier concentration on political stories. Fox's full-day average of 1.26 million people on Thursday beat the 1.1 million it has been typically drawing this year. MSNBC had 370,000 viewers, lower than its non-Olympic average of 405,000 this year, Nielsen said.
http://news.yahoo.com/feds-flood-colorado-river-grand-canyon-081527473.html	Feds flood Colorado River through Grand Canyon	FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) — Federal officials opened the floodgates at Glen Canyon Dam on Monday, sending water rushing through the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon. The five-day flood is meant to mimic conditions of the river before the dam was built, because the dam now blocks a majority of the sediment from traveling downstream.___HOW MUCH WATER AND SEDIMENT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE GRAND CANYON?The amount of water released over 96 hours will fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool every 2.5 seconds. The flood will distribute enough sediment through the Grand Canyon to bury a professional football stadium up to the lighting.___WHO BENEFITS FROM THE FLOOD?Water managers and federal officials believe the increased sediment will improve beaches for campers along the river and breeding grounds for the endangered humpback chub. They say extra layers of sand will protect archaeological sites. Trout fishing should improve at Lees Ferry, about 16 miles downstream from the dam. Grand Canyon officials have warned river users and backpackers that campsites will be in shorter supply during the flood but will be more plentiful after it's over.___DOES THE FLOOD HAVE ANY EFFECT ON THE WATER SUPPLY OF THE SOUTHWEST DURING THE DROUGHT?No. To create the flood, Lake Powell will shrink by 2 1/2 feet. But Lake Mead in Nevada will rise by 2 1/2 feet as the increased amounts of water flow through the Colorado River and to Lake Mead. The flood won't alter the amount of water sent between the two lakes annually, as monthly adjustments are made to account for the surge in water, officials said.___HOW MANY OF THESE EXPERIMENTS HAVE BEEN DONE?This week's experiment is the third since the U.S. Department of Interior declared them routine through 2020. The floods have accomplished the intended effect in building up beaches and sandbars, but the results often are short-lived. Federal officials want to study results over a longer time frame to see if the sediment can be maintained. "The natural ebb and flow of things historically would have been something like with floods," said Matthew Allen, a spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation in Salt Lake City. "All these sandbars build up and wash away, build up and wash away."___WHEN IS THE NEXT HIGH-FLOW EXPERIMENT?The Interior Department has said it would evaluate springtime floods starting in 2015, depending on the sediment available from Colorado River tributaries. Past experiments have shown that flooding the river in the springtime increases the population of trout that prey on native fish.
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/11/20/michael-phelps-reported-girlfriend-drops-bombshell/20996559/	Michael Phelps' reported girlfriend drops bombshell	One of the world's most famous athletes Michael Phelps has quite the history of making headlines away from the pool, but his latest venture into the spotlight involves his girlfriend and a seemingly unnecessary debate over whether she was born a man or woman.Taylor Lianne Chandler told Radar Online she was born with both sets of reproductive organs, but she identified as a boy until her teenage years. While that's considered being born intersex, you'll note the outlet's headline reads she "Was Born A Man!"Phelps is currently in rehab and serving a six-month suspension from USA Swimming after police in Maryland arrested him for his second DUI in late September. By far the most decorated Olympic athlete in history, Phelps was in the process of training for the 2016 Olympics at the time of his arrest. (Video via CNN & ABC)Chandler also told Radar Online she met Phelps in August through the matchmaking app Tinder, and she told him about her past through an email while he was in rehab. She says the Olympian has yet to respond.She said, "Michael is a brand, and dating someone like me may not be the best thing. I just hope he follows his heart and not what his people tell him."And oh, the headlines that followed. Virtually every headline about the revelation to this point says Chandler was born a man, a boy or a male. The Daily Mail's headline reads Chandler "admits she was born a male" as though she's done something wrong.And Chandler does appear to have some real remorse about not telling Phelps a very intimate secret earlier in their relationship, but the gender identity reporting hasn't gone over well with her.In a Facebook post Wednesday, Chandler appeared to reference the Radar Online article when she wrote, in part, "Two steps forward and 100 steps backwards. ... In a world of educated people that had all the facts of intersex and what it means and then to sell a magazine say[ing] Michael Phelps is dating a MAN. I have cried now for an hour."The Intersex Society of North America tries to combat misconceptions about the incredibly complex issue. "Rather than trying to play a semantic game that never ends ... We work to build a world free of shame, secrecy, and unwanted genital surgeries for anyone born with what someone believes to be non-standard sexual anatomy."Chandler doesn't know if her relationship with Phelps will continue once he leaves rehab.Also on AOL:
http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-simple-question-grimes-wont-answer-again/	The simple question Alison Lundergan Grimes wouldn't answer - again	Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Kentucky Democrat challenging Republican Leader Mitch McConnell for his seat in the Senate, once again on Monday night refused to say who she voted for in the 2012 presidential election.In a debate against McConnell, Grimes said she is refusing to answer the question as a "matter of principle.""Our Constitution grants here in Kentucky the constitutional right for privacy at the ballot box, for a secret ballot," she told debate moderator Bill Goodman, host of "Kentucky Tonight." As Kentucky's secretary of state, Grimes said she is "tasked with overseeing and making sure we're enforcing all of our election laws... to ensure privacy at the ballot box... I'm not going to compromise a constitutional right provided here in Kentucky in order to curry favor on one or other side, or for members of the media."Did Alison Lundergan Grimes vote for Obama?Locked in a competitive race against McConnell, Grimes has gone out of her way to distance herself from the president. She first refused to say in an interview with the Louisville Courier-Journal editorial board whether she voted for Mr. Obama in 2008 and 2012, even though she was a delegate for Mr. Obama at the 2012 Democratic Convention.When pressed on the issue, Grimes has emphasized her ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton, who are considerably more popular than the president in the Bluegrass State.In Monday's debate, Grimes explained that the difference between a "Clinton Democrat" and an "Obama Democrat" comes down to "growing the middle class," noting the strong economic growth during the Clinton years.McConnell, meanwhile, said "there's not a dime's worth of difference" between Clinton Democrats and Obama Democrats."He added that there's no "sacred right" to privacy at the ballot box. "I voted for Mitt Romney proudly," he said.The debate focused largely on the economy, with Grimes railing against McConnell for failing to stimulate the Kentucky job market."It is a senator's No. 1 priority to bring jobs back here to Kentucky," she said, alluding to a moment earlier in the year in which McConnell said it was "not my job" to bring jobs back to the state."We haven't had someone reach across the aisle with a jobs plan," Grimes said.McConnell, meanwhile, slammed the "job-killing Obama administration, which my opponent supports."
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/24/project-landis_n_6369332.html?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000592	Dog With Bent Legs And Curved Spine From Awful Living Conditions Gets A New, Loving Start	This dog with a dark past is now looking toward a bright future.Earlier this month, Second Chance Rescue in New York City received a plea for help from a shelter in Georgia regarding a pit-bull mix, who has since been named Landis. The canine was emaciated with several serious medical problems."The tendons in all 4 legs are ruptured due to his prior living conditions. He is very small and underweight," Jacquelyn O'Sullivan of Second Chance Rescue told the Huffington Post in an e-mail. "His body condition tell us that he lived in a small space, hence his dwarf-like appearance, bent legs and curved spine.Members of the rescue group were deeply affected by the pictures they received of the poor pup. Inaction was not an option for them."We were heartbroken and horrified and knew we had to help him," O'Sullivan told HuffPost.The organization got straight to work and sent the pup to one of their veterinarians the next morning, kicking off Landis' recovery process. The pup will arrive in New York City on Tuesday to finish the remainder of his treatment. O'Sullivan says that the group is eager to help the canine get in good shape and look forward to a life with plenty of TLC.While Landis is lucky to have been given a new beginning, his past serves as a serious reminder to pet owners that hard work goes into caring for a furry friend."[Dogs] cannot take care of themselves. We see way too many neglected and abused animals. Ask for help before they end up in horrible shape. No living creature deserves to be abused or neglected," O'Sullivan wrote in her e-mail. "Treat them like part of your family. Remember that dogs feel pain and experience sadness."O'Sullivan told HuffPost that she looks forward to seeing Landis' transformation, and says that the organization has already received requests from all around the country from people willing to adopt the precious pooch -- one who, she says, has a beautiful personality despite all he's been through."Landis is amazing, very sweet and loving," O'Sullivan said. "He has won the hearts of everyone who has met him and many who have not met him. He has definitely struck a chord with people everywhere."Like Us On Facebook Follow Us On Twitter

For example, you might be asked, “Tell me why you think you might be the person for this job?” Or perhaps one like this: “Describe for me what you do in your current job.” But you can almost be absolutely guaranteed to be asked this one: “Tell me about yourself.”While most job candidates have little if any difficulty answering the first two example questions, a surprising number of candidates seem to entirely miss the point when answering the “tell me about yourself” question.Actually, when most hiring managers or other hiring professionals ask you, “Tell me about yourself,” the very last thing they actually want you to do is, well, to tell them about yourself!How do most candidates answer this question? Normally, the answer goes along these lines:“Well, let me see . . . I grew up on a dairy farm just outside Green Bay, WI, and of course I am a BIG Green Bay Packers fan! You can’t live in Green Bay without being a Packer’s fan, you know, etc., etc., etc.”Some candidates continue to detail their entire life history and don’t become aware that they have gone far, far afield until they see the hiring professional’s eye begin to glaze over!Am I suggesting that a hiring professional doesn’t care to learn anything personal about you, the candidate, at this point? Yes, that’s precisely what I am suggesting! What the hiring professional is usually laser-focused on at this very early stage of the game is just one thing: Finding the very best candidate to fill an open position at his or her company. If you were to become the candidate of choice, the hiring professional may then want to learn more about your personal life and background, but until that time. . . .OK, so how should you answer the “Tell me about yourself” question?In our executive recruiting firm, The Hire to Win Group, we coach candidates we present to our hiring company clients to use a THREE-PART approach to answering the “Tell me about yourself” question. (Parts 1 and 2 can normally be used from interview to interview, while Part 3 needs to be customized for each unique career opportunity.)PART 1Normally, the first part of the answer will consist of a one-sentence statement of your career history, i.e., essentially the condensed version of your entire career. But that’s not as challenging as perhaps it might first appear. Here is an example of how you might accomplish that goal:“I am a five-year veteran of LAN/WAN administration and systems engineering, with substantial experience using a variety of contemporary business software systems.”PART 2This part consists of a one- OR two-sentence summary of a single career accomplishment that you are especially proud of and one that you can reasonably expect to capture the hiring manager’s attention and interest. It must, however, be an accomplishment that can easily be explained and/or illustrated. Plus, it must also highlight a “bottom-line” impact for the potential employer. Here is an example:“Recently, as a long-term contract employee at a local regional bank, I learned that the bank was about to install a particular software system and was planning to use an outside firm for the project. I let them know that I had done a similar installation at my last assignment, outlined how we could get the job done with in-house staff and successfully complete the installation for $55,000 to $65,000 less than it would have cost with outside consultants.”PART 3This final part of the answer is the most dynamic, as well as the part that must be customized for each unique career opportunity. It should be a one- OR two-sentence summary of specifically what you seek in your next career move AND it must be relevant to the position being sought. Here is how you might construct this final part of your answer:“For the next step in my career, I would like to move away from contract work and find myself as a direct employee of a large firm where I can join a substantial IT team and be involved with a group that focuses on email and network security applications, while having access to the knowledge base that would come with a large, diverse IT group.”Obviously, you would tailor your answer to fit your unique skill set and professional discipline, but the principles and approach featured in this example would nonetheless apply. And, of course, you wouldn’t break up your answer into individual parts as I’ve illustrated here. Rather, all three parts would constitute your entire answer. This example answer, by the way, would take about one-minute to deliver.By using this approach to answer the “Tell me about yourself” question, you will clearly and quickly brand yourself as a true professional, someone who knows the value of what you have to offer a potential employer. It will also set you widely and distinctly apart from the overwhelming majority of your “competition,” i.e., those other candidates interviewing for the same position(s) as you!You will immediately have the hiring manager’s attention, and gain her respect, with an answer like this. On the other hand, most other candidates for the position you seek more than likely will see fit to drone on and on about their life histories. The hiring manager’s eyes will glaze over, she will begin to slump in her chair. And, she will soon be looking for a way to quickly end those interviews so she can get to the type of candidate she seeks to fill her open position—a candidate like YOU!This article was syndicated from Business 2 Community: How You Answer This ‘Warm-up’ Question May Leave You ‘Out-in-the-Cold’More Business articles from Business 2 Community:10 Marketing Bloggers You Need to Start Folllowing Big Data And Cloud For SMBs Starts With Engagement Using Social Listening To Discover The Truth About Your Brand What’s The ROI Of Outsourcing B2B Telemarketing Services? 2015 Content Trends: Top Tips for Spending Your Budget Wisely
http://www.examiner.com/list/jessa-duggar-wedding-reception-response-from-the-bride-during-honeymoon	Jessa Duggar: Wedding reception response from the bride during honeymoon	Jessa acknowledges rumors are true! Jessa Seewald / InstagramJessa Duggar is happily married to Ben Seewald and away at a private location enjoying their honeymoon. While spending this special time with her husband, she has found time to either check online or talk with family to see and hear what fans of the reality show “19 Kids and Counting” have been saying. On November 9, according to Fox News Jessa revealed that she and Ben did indeed consummate their marriage in a room before the wedding reception at the church.In her response posted to Instagram she stated to all; “Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good,' she wrote with a photo of a Bible passage. The biblical scripture reads. 'Repay no one evil for evil, but give thought to do what is honorable in the sight of all. Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written. Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord."Aside from the fact that the bride and groom did not kiss at the altar there were a few other things that the couple did during their wedding that some say were also untraditional as far as weddings go. Jessa wore a pale blush rose colored princess gown in lieu of the more common white and lace bridal gown most women choose to wear. The wedding was held at the First Baptist Church in Arkansas and there were around 1,000 people in attendance. At the reception instead of serving a tiered wedding cake with roses and a cake topper of a bride and groom, Jessa and Ben chose instead to serve ice cream sundaes to their guests to share as their wedding dessert.One thing she also feels strongly about is, knowing that living her life with her best friend is the greatest feeling and emotion a couple can share together.New episodes will air on Tuesdays at 9:00 p.m. EST on TLC so stay tuned in to watch and catch up with the Duggar clan on “19 Kids and Counting”!
http://www.examiner.com/article/sergey-kovalev-s-trainer-advised-floyd-mayweather-to-forget-about-manny-pacquiao	Sergey Kovalev's trainer advised Floyd Mayweather to forget about Manny Pacquiao	Play Manny Pacquiao says Floyd Mayweather is still ducking him YouTube/ESPN/MortalKombtMastrSome observers say Manny "PacMan" Pacquiao is still busy preparing for his upcoming fight against Chris Algieri in Macao, China, but based on a posted tweet by ANC or ABS-CBN News Channel this morning, Nov. 11, 2014, Freddie Roach is assuring everyone that the former pound for pound king is already in shape almost twelve days before the fight. “Coach Freddie Roach says Manny Pacquiao 100% conditioned for fight vs. Chris Algieri,” ANC tweeted.YouTube/video screenshot/rainydayFreddie’s revelation with ANC is just a simple exposition, however, it is very important to the supporters of Manny Pacquiao especially those who want to know about his present condition. Right now, their only wish for him is to win his battle against the former junior welterweight title holder because they believe that his impressive win will give him the ticket to get a shot with Floyd Mayweather Jr. who is still undecided to reveal his future opponent.And speaking of Floyd Mayweather; someone is talking about him and his future foe. In an interview with Jenna J of "On The Ropes Boxing Radio," John David Jackson, trainer of the unified light heavyweight champion, Sergey Kovalev, instructed the “Money Man,” Floyd Mayweather Jr. to fight Gennady “GGG” Golovkin instead of thinking a super fight with Manny Pacquiao. You guys know that aside from his welterweight title, Floyd also holds junior middleweight belt which according to John David Jackson is Floyd’s chance to defend the title to a fighter like “GGG.”Jackson added that he wants to see the "Money Man" duplicating the actions of Bernard Hopkins who at 49-years-old accepted a dangerous opponent. “Listen, I hate to say it, but don’t fight Manny, fight Golovkin, he’s a little bit bigger. It’s like Bermard Hopkins fighting Sergey, let Floyd fight Golovkin. One thing about Golovkin is he’s coming right at you, he’s coming to knock your head off, he’s not afraid of you. He’s just like Sergey Kovalev, he’s coming right at you to knock your head off,” John David Jackson said.

http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/blackhawks-assistant-equipment-manager-passes-away-sunday-morning-225437738.html	Blackhawks assistant equipment manager dies Sunday morning	View photo. Photo via Chicago Blackhawks Some sad news out of Chicago. Blackhawks assistant equipment manager Clint Reif, 34, died Sunday morning. Below is the release from Chicago.“We are deeply saddened by the untimely loss of one of our own family members this morning, assistant equipment manager Clint Reif. Like all trainers and support staff within our organization, Clint was instrumental in helping our players and coaches prepare and compete both on and off the ice. Our sincerest sympathies go out to the Reif family.”While the cause of death is still unknown according to reports, the below blurb was published in the Chicago Sun-Times.According to a DuPage County coroner statement, Reif was found unresponsive in his Lombard home, where he was pronounced dead at 8:32 a.m. The death still is under investigation by the coroner’s office and Lombard police, officials said.The above photo is a decal players wore for Reif on their helmets in Sunday's game against Toronto. The Blackhawks held a moment of silence prior to the contestFor all these guys who spend a lot of time together, it's like losing a family member. Reif was in his ninth season with the Blackhawks, according to the team's website. Following the game, a 4-0 win by the Blackhawks, there was clearly a sullen mood amongst the players.From the Chicago Tribune:Asked what made Reif so special, Patrick Sharp began to answer but then apologized and walked out of the dressing room.Duncan Keith, who was perhaps the player closest to Reif, said: "It was tough. To lose a close friend and have to try to play a hockey game on that same day, it wasn't easy."From CSN Chicago:"It's tough to describe," (Jonathan) Toews said, pausing between each sentence. "I think a lot of people, whether guys in this locker room or anyone else, other athletes, who have lost someone close to them and have to find ways to get their minds together and go out there any play as a team ... It's really tough to describe, something that still hasn't sunk in for most of us yet. But we were definitely playing with heavy hearts out there."We're still in disbelief. The fact we went out there and played the way we did, we dedicated that one to our good friend Clint."Below are tweets from former Blackhawks members on Reif: Just terrible to hear about the passing of Clint Reif. One of the best guys I've met through hockey. RIP my friend. #veryfaast— Viktor Stalberg (@VStalberg) December 21, 2014Thoughts and prayers with the Reif family. Such a wonderful person to b around.— Brian Campbell (@bcampbell_51) December 21, 2014Rest in peace Clint. Everyone keep the Reif family in your thoughts.— brandon pirri (@pirri91) December 21, 2014Players know and certainly appreciate the hard work and effort of equipment managers who sharpen their skates and fix their helmets. Managers tend to become close with the people they serve, and it sounds like Reif was no different with the Blackhawks. While this thought is clearly not in the front of people's minds right now, but with Chicago playing in the Jan. 1 Winter Classic and the NHL and the Blackhawks filming an all access series with EPIX to promote the event, one does have to make sure this situation will be handled the right way on screen.  Again, just terrible news. Thoughts go to Reif's family, his wife Kelly and their four children -- daughters Florence, Aislynn, Colette and son, C.J.- - - - - - -Josh Cooper is an editor for Puck Daddy on Yahoo Sports.

http://www.aol.com/article/2014/11/18/judge-refuses-to-toss-rick-perry-case-on-technicalities/20995692/	Judge refuses to toss Perry case on technicalities	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - A Texas judge refused on Tuesday to quash on technicalities two criminal felony indictments for abuse of power against Gov. Rick Perry, ruling that the potentially embarrassing case against the possible 2016 presidential hopeful should proceed.The governor's defense team had sought to have the matter thrown out, arguing that the special prosecutor, Michael McCrum, wasn't properly sworn in and some paperwork wasn't correctly filed. But a written ruling from District Judge Bert Richardson, who like Perry is a Republican, sided with McCrum."This court concludes that Mr. McCrum's authority was not voided by procedural irregularities," Richardson wrote.An Austin grand jury indicted Perry in August on charges of abuse of official power and coercion of a public servant. He's accused of publicly threatening, then carrying out, a veto of state funding for public corruption prosecutors after the unit's Democratic district attorney refused to resign following a drunken driving conviction.Perry made his first court appearance Nov. 6. He calls the case a political witch hunt and says he'd issue the veto again.His attorneys have also sought to have the charges against Perry dismissed on constitutional grounds, but Richardson has yet to have a hearing on that challenge and isn't expected to rule on it for weeks.The day before Richardson's ruling, Perry's defense team filed a 28-page brief asserting that the case shouldn't continue because Perry's actions were protected by the constitutional powers of his office. They also bristled at McCrum's past suggestions that the governor wasn't above the law in arguing that his fate should be decided by a jury - just like any criminal defendant."This invalid prosecution cannot go to trial - not because Governor Perry is above the law, but because everything he is accused of this case is absolutely protected," the attorneys wrote Monday.Perry didn't seek re-election but is seriously considering a second White House run after his 2012 bid flamed out in a series of memorable gaffes. He said he may announce a decision by May or June.Top national Republicans initially lined up to praise Perry and decry the criminal case against him, but they've been less vocal about their support as the case drags on.In arguing that it should be tossed out because of technicalities, Perry's lead attorney, Houston-based Tony Buzbee, had repeatedly cited the U.S. Constitution and said it should apply to all matters, no matter how small."If you're going to take away someone's freedom, it's not too much to ask you follow the letter of the law," Buzbee said in Richardson's courtroom this month. "If we start picking and choosing which parts of the Constitution that we're going to follow, that's utter chaos. That's anarchy."McCrum countered that he'd followed procedure and that a jury should decide the case. In court, the special prosecutor repeatedly referred to "Mr. Perry," rather than calling him governor.More from AOL.com: Israel vows harsh response to synagogue attack Virginia college student's death ruled homicide Right-to-die advocate's mom blasts Vatican remarks

http://www.examiner.com/article/aliens-are-divided-into-two-groups-on-earth-says-boyd-bushman	Aliens are 'divided into two groups' on earth, says Boyd Bushman	Play YouTube video of Boyd Bushman discussing UFOs and alien life on earth. Shocking News / YouTubeAliens on earth are divided into two groups and have distinct differences. This report comes from a Tech Times report on Nov. 8 that highlights claims made by a deceased scientist who worked at Area 51 and held high positions with Lockheed-Martin, Hughes Aircraft, and various other aerospace divisions. Boyd Bushman made news last week when he alleged that the U.S. government has secret ties with UFOs and aliens and that a conspiracy exists to keep information from the publicA video Bushman made before his death on Aug. 7 was revealed in October. In it, he showed several photographs of aliens and UFOs. He stated that there are a handful of aliens that actually reside here on earth and hold federal jobs.Bushman said in the video that it takes an estimated 45 minutes for aliens to reach earth from their native planet of Quintumnia. On earth, they operate under a type of "cattle ranch" structure consisting of two groups. Bushman shares the details."One group are wranglers, and the others are rustlers - the ones who are stealers of cattle. The two groups act differently. The ones that are wranglers are much more friendly, and have a better relationship with us."Boyd Bushman defined the aliens as standing between four-and-a-half to five-feet. He even claims that he came into contact with some aliens that are 230-years-old.Bushman further explained that aliens have three backbones, are formed of cartilage, and are similar to human beings with their "appendages." The mysterious forms of life powerful traits stemming from evolution."They're able to use their own voice by telepathy to talk to you. You walk in the room with one of them, and all of a sudden you find yourself giving the answer to your question in your own voice."Apparently the "wranglers" alien group are working with scientific experts in China and Russia to develop "anti-gravity technology" for earthlings, alleges Bushman; vice versa, there are humans "working around the clock on aliens spaceships."To many, Boyd Bushman's claims are way out there at best, but due to his prominence in the history of aerospace research, it warrants a bit of pondering. Alejandro Rojas from Open Minds posted one of many possibilities on Bushman's allegations. He writes that it could simply be "delusional ramblings of an old man," but the fact he was such a high-level scientist makes him wonder why he'd fabricate crazy stories.Are there aliens living here on earth and divided into two different groups? If scientists from earth are working with UFOs, that would be even wilder yet.

Jack's dad wasn't pleased, and spent the following three minutes reading the label of the glow stick to figure out what to do. The result is a sad but hilarious video uploaded to YouTube by Jack's older brother."God dammit, Jack!" the dad yells. "I have to see what to do, you dingaling! ... Not to mention it's all over your awesome shirt."Luckily, Jack probably won't go blind. The chemical inside most glow sticks -- dibutyl phthalate -- is low in toxicity and causes only minor irritation if swallowed or in contact with the eye. Most poison centers recommend flushing out the eye with water for at least 10 minutes, and calling a poison control center if irritation persists.Also: Don't microwave glow sticks, people.Like Us On Facebook | Follow Us On Twitter | Contact The Author

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/25/ouija_n_6047432.html?utm_hp_ref=entertainment&ir=Entertainment	Box office update: ‘Ouija’ scores with $8.3 million Friday	Image Credit: UniversalKeanu Reeves is no match for a board game, it seems. After debuting in early Thursday night showings, Universal’s spooky Ouija has earned an estimated $8.3 million, putting it on track for a $20 million weekend, while Lionsgate and Summit’s John Wick took in an estimated $5.45 million, suggesting the violent revenge pic will net out around $14 million by weekend’s close.While Ouija, which cost Blumhouse and Platinum Dunes less than $5 million to produce, is a resounding success, $20 million is a little less impressive than the standard Blumhouse fate. The Purge and The Purge: Anarchy, for instance, opened to $34.1 and $29.1 million respectively. This is more on par with 2012’s Sinister, which had an $18 million opening weekend in mid-October and grossed $48.1 million domestically by the end of its run.Based on exit polling data, audiences didn’t seem to like either new opener all that much, though. Critics may have loved John Wick, but it only managed to get a B CinemaScore, while Ouija, which was pretty universally loathed by reviewers, picked up a deadly C CinemaScore.St. Vincent, meanwhile, managed to snag a spot in the top five after its nationwide expansion with an estimated $2.6 million on Friday. The Theodore Melfi comedy, starring Bill Murray and Melissa McCarthy, has played well for two weekends in limited release, and audiences gave it an A- Cinema Score.Here’s the top five:1. Ouija — $8.3 million 2. John Wick — $5.45 million 3. Fury — $4.1 million  ($37.2 million domestic total) 4. Gone Girl — $3.5 million ($116.5 million domestic total) 5. St. Vincent — $2.6 million ($3.68 million domestic total)Check in tomorrow for estimates and analysis.
http://www.examiner.com/article/obamacare-scandal-healthcare-law-lies-to-u-s-megyn-kelly-of-fox-news-loses-it	Obamacare scandal: Healthcare law lies to U.S., Megyn Kelly of Fox News loses it	Play WASHINGTON -- Democrats have repeatedly mocked Republican promises to craft a replacement for Obamacare, and while the GOP is reportedly working on a plan, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) had only another promise to offer on Wednesday. on.aol.comObamacare has been a controversial healthcare plan since its introduction, but Megyn Kelly seemed to lose it on the air this week after hearing the latest lies and “scandal” surrounding the law. This week, the Fox News host grew visibly angry after welcoming Bernard Whitman, a Democrat and political activist, onto her talk show, “The Kelly File.” Breitbart News reveals this Thursday, November 13, that Kelly was adamant in arguing that the purposes of President Obama’s Affordable Care Act have been misconstrued by the American public for months now.Wikimedia CommonsAre Obamacare “lies” something the U.S. public should really worry about this 2014? Megyn Kelly of Fox News certainly thinks so. The TV host lost her cool on the air this week while having a heated debate with Democrat Whitman over Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber’s recent comments. Gruber, a national economist, apparently stated that the only reason the healthcare law passed was due to the American people being utterly deceived at its original intent. Kelly says that Gruber in fact hinted President Obama’s “takeover” health care plan a long time ago.“He said in January that Obamacare was never meant to save money, don’t worry about that. But before it was passed, he said it was a deficit reducer, it was a cost effective step towards healthcare problems….Now he comes out and says, all that stuff we said about taxes, that was B.S. And this other stuff, it’s all B.S. We had to do it, because we had to get this law passed, and sorry.”For his part, Whitman says that although Gruber might deserve to be known as skillful when it comes to public policy, he remains “a political idiot.” The Democrat continued by saying that the Affordable Health Care Act — Whitman never used the unofficial term “Obamacare” — has been successfully already, despite rumors of lies or scandal surrounding the bill.“The fact is, the Affordable Care Act has brought down the deficit by almost $100 billion largely due to Medicaid reductions,” he said. The fact is, the cost of healthcare is going down. It went up 8% before this law, it’s now going up 4% … The fact is, 18% of Americans did not have health insurance before the law passed, that’s down to 13%. Over 15 million folks who didn’t have health insurance before the ACA was signed into law in 2010 are now covered bringing the total uninsured adults in the US from 18% to 13.4%.”While Megan Kelly lost it upon hearing Whitman’s comments, Western Journalism News notes this evening that many from the U.S. public took issue with these statements as well. After all, says the report, the Senate Budget Committee revealed that the ACA will in fact be incurring an estimated $131 billion in federal deficits between 2015 and 2024, while a considerable number of American citizens are now experiencing higher deductibles that will ultimately lead to more expensive costs out-of-pocket.The Fox News host denied Whitman’s claim that “everyone knew what they were getting.” She said Obamacare lies to the people, and that the healthcare law is in fact based on an untruth.“Oh my God," she said. "Seriously? Seriously? Everyone knew what they were getting? Is that what you want the viewers to believe? … My head is about to explode.”Regardless of which side U.S. citizens stand on, open enrollment for the Affordable Care Act is on its way soon. Enrollment for healthcare insurance officially starts this November 15, and will close on February 2015. Do you agree with Democrat Whitman’s support of Obamacare, or Kelly’s argument that the bill was ultimately passed on nothing but a “lie?”Obamacare was first brought into the public limelight this week after the “architect” of the controversial healthcare law stated that the “stupidity” of the American voters was the only reason the bill passed. Jonathan Gruber says that community ignorance of what President Obama’s new plan actually entailed resulted in Obamacare ever making it through Congress. Do you agree?

http://www.aol.com/article/2014/10/14/cdc-rapid-response-team-for-any-new-ebola-cases/20978134/	CDC: Rapid response team for any new Ebola cases	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government will send a rapid response team to any hospital in the country that diagnoses another Ebola patient, to make sure the local health workers can provide care safely.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has specialists implementing changes to protect health workers at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas as it cares for a nurse who became infected while treating Thomas Eric Duncan, the first Ebola patient diagnosed in the U.S.CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said Tuesday that it's still not clear how the nurse became infected, but that he wished his agency had sent in what he called an "Ebola response team" when Duncan was diagnosed on Sept. 30."That might have prevented this infection," he said.Since Duncan's diagnosis, CDC had been advising the Dallas hospital, which has said it also underwent Ebola training before Duncan's arrival.But Frieden described the new response team as having some of the world's leading experts in how to care for Ebola and protect health care workers from it. They would be charged with everything from examining how the isolation room is physically laid out, to what protective equipment health workers use, to waste management and decontamination.If another case is diagnosed, "we will be there, hands-on, within hours," he said.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eat-the-press/2006/06/27/teenage-wasteland-where-_e_23883.html	Eat The Press | TEENAGE WASTELAND: Where Are The Mags for Teenage Boys?	Andrew Hearst/PanopticistHuffington Post |  Melissa Lafsky |  Posted Tuesday June 27, 2006 at 11:51 AMTwo weeks ago, blogger Andrew Hearst, well-known in the industry for his magazine-cover parodies, posted another offering on his site, Panopticist.com. Hearst's latest was a takeoff of teen-girl bible Seventeen, re-imagined as a book for teenage boys called "Sementeen."Yet a quick scan of newsstands reveals that Hearst has imagined not only a title but an entire genre: in a space crowded with books like Seventeen, CosmoGirl and Teen Vogue, not a single general interest magazine exists for teenage boys. A Magazine Publishers of America's 2004 Teen Market Profile shows that the total number of teens in the United States grew by 4.5 million between 1990 and 2000, a 17% increase in a group holding substantial spending power and market sway. According to a 2004 Neopets Youth Study, eight out of ten teens read magazines, translating into 19.3-million readers in a demographic with a proven disproportionate influence on fashion and purchasing trends. But while giants like Hearst and Condé Nast currently publish three titles apiece for girls, magazines aimed at boys, including Dirt, Transworld Stance and the never-launched K-Max, have come and gone. Time Inc.'s Teen People is currently the only top-selling teen magazine designed for both boys and girls, though its frequent beauty and fashion articles shift the focus towards female readers.So why no magazines for the other half of the teen market?Perhaps it's because publishers fear that a market doesn't exist. Rodale launched the short-lived MH-18 in October of 2000, which lasted seven issues. Rather than a lifestyle book like Dirt, which focused on music and pop culture and lasted one issue, MH-18 was developed developed as a teen version of Men's Health, highlighting topics like bodybuilding, workout advice and tips for getting dates. It sold 75,000 copies per issue before ceasing publication. But MH-18 former Editor-in-Chief and current Executive Editor of Best Life Jeff Csatari blames the timing and the marketing, not the content or the market. "There was nothing for teen boys like this," said Csatari. "After 9/11 the advertising market went south and there was new management at the company and they pulled the plug. It was doing real well. It was just a really smart idea."The prevailing attitude in the industry is that magazines aimed at teenage boys simply won't sell. "The general consensus is that teenage boys are already reading Maxim and don't want to read anything else that's not about video games," said Jeff Bercovici, Media Editor of Women's Wear Daily. But Eric Gillin, Entertainment Editor at Maxim, disagrees. "We're not aimed at [teen boys]. That's not who we're aimed at," he said. One source noted that "advertisers do not believe teen boys are interested in print magazines...the only exceptions being very vertical titles in categories like skateboarding, snowboarding, etc. They think they can reach teen boys through online and some TV much better." But a 2003 Nielson cross-media comparison found that teens in fact trust ads in magazines more than those in radio, TV or the internet.Concerns over cultural differences have hindered marketing strategies for magazines aimed at teen boys. "This is a demographic that's simply not used to reading magazines--unless it's the SI swimsuit issue," said Men's Health Editor-in-Chief and Rodale Senior Vice President David Zinczenko. The continuing lack of popular titles for teen boys arguably forms a vicious circle, as well. "I work at a magazine because I grew up reading magazines," said Seventeen Editor-in-Chief Atoosa Rubinstein. "Because of this, teen girls are easier to market to." Stereotypes also play a part. "There's a stigma maybe that teen boys dont read, that teen boys are playing video games," said Gillin.Behavior and buying patterns also make teen boys a unique group for marketers. "The traditional route of getting magazines to people doesnt work [for teen boys]," said Csatari. "Eighty percent of MH-18 copies were being sold in supermarkets. How many teen boys do you know who hang out in supermarkets?" With a little more time, Csatari thinks things might have gone differently. "We were on the verge of new ideas when the plug was pulled," said Csatari, who speculated that new marketing tools such as promotions through sportswear catalogues like Eastbay would have been more effective.Some argue that the needs of teenage boys are already being met by men's magazines and specialty books such as Transworld SKATEboarding. "I dont feel like that market is not being served; it's just being served piecemeal. It's being served indirectly," said Gillin, who says that teen boys want to read what their fathers are reading. "Magazines are in a way about selling fantasy," said Gillin. "What's better than peeking at your dad's back issues of Maxim?"But others hold a different view. "I think of boys as the lost generation," said Rubinstein. "Boys intuitively and because of cultural norms, boys tend to go inside themselves. But they have those same struggles [as teenage girls], they're just a little harder to pin down...No one's protecting teenage boys the way we do teen girls." Said Csatari, "The teen years are very scary times. You dont go to your mom and dad to answer these questions...With a magazine it's just you one on one with the editors. You get real information that you can apply to your life."Industry insiders agree that, to be successful, a teen boys magazine would require a high level of dedication to the demographic. "It's a tough market to reach, but I think the potential is there for someone who has the content and the staying power," said Csatari. Rubinstein says the time has come to find the right man for the job, saying, "I'm looking for a male Atoosa: a man who will care as passionately as I do about teen girls, for boys."

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/clint-eastwood-would-destroy-donald-trump-in-election_55d6153de4b055a6dab35034	If Clint Eastwood Ran For President, He Would Destroy Donald Trump	Presidential hopeful Donald Trump might be doing well in the polls, but a recent survey released Thursday shows his chances would be destroyed if Oscar winner Clint Eastwood entered the race. Which would be astounding, given that the last time Eastwood took to politics was at the Republican National Convention in 2012 when he jabbered on incoherently at an empty chair that an imaginary Barack Obama was sitting in, a scene that left attendees dumbfounded. And yet, it seems that Americans would rather vote for a rambling, gravelly voiced Hollywood icon than the unfiltered egotistical real estate tycoon who currently leads our news coverage. At least that’s what one survey, conducted online by Harris Poll in July, tells us. It matched up well-known celebrities against real presidential candidates to see how they would perform in a hypothetical -- and far-fetched -- electoral race.Celebrities with no plans to run for office, of course, have the advantage of enjoying near-universal name recognition and the ardor of dedicated fanbases without any of the pesky drawbacks traditionally associated with serious feats of electioneering -- like worrying about fundraising, or developing a controversial political platform. This isn’t surprising to most pollsters, who’ve long documented the fact that even real politicians tend to curry more favor with the public while they’re on paper than they do after they enter the ring. But the results collected by Harris only further reaffirm America's grave disappointment and dislike of the 2016 presidential field.Those Americans surveyed are more than twice as likely to say they'd vote for Eastwood than they are to say they'd vote for Trump; 72 percent would support Clint while only 28 percent would back The Donald. But these poll respondents consistently preferred Hollywood power to political glower. For example, George Clooney bests Jeb Bush, 57 percent to 43 percent; Ben Affleck would defeat Ted Cruz by 18 percent; and Jimmy Fallon would beat Rand Paul by 10 percent.Democratic nominees Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders fare somewhat better, but are not completely in the clear. Clinton beats Oprah Winfrey by 10 percent, and Sanders beats Jerry Seinfeld by 9 percent.Another Harris Poll conducted in August found that Morgan Freeman, Clint Eastwood and Jon Stewart were the top three celebrities that Americans think would make a good president. The survey also found that nearly 6 in 10 Americans think a celebrity would make a good president. This may work better in theory than it does in practice, but it does underscore a latent public affection for political figures who emerge from off the beaten path. The 2016 cycle, in fact, has been unique in the way it’s given rise to candidates without a traditional background in elected office, such as Trump, neurosurgeon Ben Carson and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina -- three candidates who emerged from the first GOP debate with more support than they’d previously garnered.The Harris Polls were sponsored by CallFire Inc., and were conducted online. One poll surveyed 2,039 adults July 22-24, and the second poll surveyed 2,084 adults Aug. 7-11.
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/mcdonalds-takes-us-inside-one-161402340.html	REVEALED: Here's The Inside Of A McDonald's Hamburger Factory	For the first time ever, McDonald's is giving customers an inside look at one of its US meat processing facilities.The company released a video Monday starring f ormer "MythBusters" co-host Grant Imahara, who tours a Cargill facility in Fresno, California, that makes, freezes, and ships McDonald's beef patties. The video begins with Imahara inspecting cuts of meat on a conveyer belt headed toward a grinder. YouTube/McDonald's "MythBusters" co-host Grant Imahara, center, inspects meat at a Cargill factory. He asks whether there is any "pink slime" in the meat, which refers to lean beef trimmings — what’s left of the meat after all the choice cuts of beef are taken — that is treated with ammonium hydroxide, creating the pink hue. "Lean finely textured beef or so-called pink slime — we don't use that in our burgers," says Rickette Collins, director of strategic supply for McDonald's. (The company has said previously that it stopped using the treated trimmings three years ago.)Next, the meat is sent through a grinder.Then the ground meat is formed into beef patties.Finally, the patties are sent to a giant freezer, just before they are boxed and packaged for shipping.There is also a grill on site, which food quality technicians use to test batches of meat as they are sent out. YouTube/McDonald's The video marks the launch of an aggressive public relations campaign in the U.S. that aims to clarify some of the mysteries surrounding McDonald's  food sourcing and processing practices.As part of the campaign, the company is inviting customers to ask questions about its food on social media. McDonald's will respond to selected questions with videos posted to YouTube, Facebook and Twitter.Some questions the company is planning to answer in the coming weeks are: "What is in my hamburger?" and "What part of the chicken is a Chicken McNugget?"The company has launched similar campaigns in Canada and Australia."We're proud of the food we serve our 27 million U.S. customers every day, yet we know people have unanswered questions," Kevin Newell, executive vice president, chief brand and strategy officer for McDonald's USA, said in a release. "So, we're inviting everyone in the U.S. on a journey to learn more about our food. We look forward to the opportunity to have an open conversation and to show people firsthand how we make our most iconic menu items."More From Business InsiderAn Obscure Italian Brand Is Suddenly The Hottest Name In Teen Retail Gap Shares Plunge After The Company Announces A New CEO Nordstrom's Simple Strategy For Beating Everyone Else In Retail
http://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/dougmaceachern/2015/08/18/green-jobs-fail-california/31929791/	MacEachern: California's epic green-jobs fail	Nothing quite compares to what happens when earnest, good-hearted greens get hold of taxpayer money to "invest" on their own. Not even good, old-fashioned, Solyndra-style crony capitalism.In 2012, California voters approved the Clean Energy Jobs Act, which raised corporate taxes and promised to create 11,000 new jobs a year and overhaul the state's public schools with new, efficient green energy systems.Three years later? Fewer than 1,700 jobs have been created, according to the Associated Press. Schools have received $297 million -- far less than originally promised, but over half of which the schools have spent on consultants and auditors. The state's largest school district, the Los Angeles Unified School District, has received $12.6 million for various Clean Energy Jobs projects, not one of which has been completed.Oh, it gets better. As usual with such well-intentioned programs, the act created a panel of wise people to oversee it. The board consists of engineers, professors and climate experts, but is  notably lean on people experienced at running efficient, job-creating enterprises. In the three years since the law passed, the board has never met. Which, everything considered, may be a good thing.The ambition built into the Clean Energy Jobs Act is impressive. State Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Leon, D-Los Angeles, estimated it would save LA schools $27 million a year on energy costs. Advocates in the state Democratic-dominated state legislature came up with the 11,000 new jobs per year figure. And the state Energy Commission, meanwhile, is holding to the belief that the act eventually will save schools $25 million a year in energy costs.And, who knows? Maybe it will. Sometimes government "investments" actually do pan out, sort of. Although that success often depends on government tipping the scales elsewhere.But if it does produce anywhere near the savings and the jobs that were predicted, the predictions that all those government people pulled out of their hats are still just wild guesses intended to make the act look pretty to voters prior to voting day.Read or Share this story: http://azc.cc/1NDGX5U
http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/576237/20141217/amazing-spider-man-3-peter-parker-actor.htm	Andrew Garfield Out, Tobey Maguire As Peter Parker In 'The Amazing Spider-Man 3' -- Report	The recent Sony Pictures hack revealed Marvel and Sony's plans of a third sequel for "The Amazing Spider-Man." However, producers made it clear that they'd want a fresh start for the movie, where it doesn't focus on the romance as the main story but to have it as a side-story instead. Ultimately, it would also mean a change of actor to play the title role aside from Andrew Garfield.Currently scheduled for a U.S. release in 2018, "The Amazing Spider-Man 3" could probably look into five actors befitting the role. According to Comicbook's Russ Burlingame these possible candidates include "Star Trek" actor Anton Yelchin, "The Flash" star Robbie Amell, "Divergent" actor Ansel Elgort, "Ultimate Spider-Man" mainstay Drake Bell and lastly the original Peter Parker Tobey Maguire.When Sony's Jeff Robinov told Amy Pascal that he wants "The Amazing Spider-Man 3" to be a clean slate and to start off with an aged Peter Parker, Burlingame thought why not bring back Tobey Maguire. Burlingame assumes having the actor to portray the role again after 20 years would "drive a ton of interest from casual fans." Likewise, it would supposedly be interesting to see if Maguire can still be compelling as the Spider-Man.Comicbook reader Anonymous 2918 and Anonymous 15909 also seemed to agree. The latter supposed Tobey Macguire as Spider-Man would be a good choice. "I think that choosing him to continue the role as an older Peter Parker would tie everything together nicely," the user said, adding that Andrew Garfield may be a good actor but he supposedly just "didn't fit" the role. Another reader named Elmis agreed on the studio's decision for a clean slate for "The Amazing Spider-Man 3." However, is against Tobey Maguire for the role of Peter Parker since the actor "may be too old" already. Meanwhile, below are some fans' reactions on the possibility of Tobey Maquire as the new Spider-Man.IGN's Scott Collura likewise claimed it would make fans happy to see the return of the actor and the Sam Raimi "Spider-Man" movies. It would supposedly also be a way to deviate from the original story.A previous report from the International Business Times claimed Andrew Garfield may not reprise his role as Peter Parker a.k.a. Spider-Man since he had allegedly displeased Sony's higher ups. Back in July the actor failed to give an hour's notice that he won't be able to attend a corporate dinner with Sony CEO Kaz Hirai and other executives. It was believed to be an "affront and slight by the company's Tokyo bosses." Likewise, Garfield had supposedly made some comments regarding the box office numbers of "The Amazing Spider-Man 2" that annoyed the wrong people. Thus, it's believed to be these reasons that his contract with Sony Pictures has officially been terminated. However, this report still warrants a confirmation from the studio or from Andrew Garfield himself.Toby Maguire in Spiderman 3 oh oh oh — Flaurent Soki (@IamFlaurentSoki) December 12, 2014Not a big Spider man fan, but have to admit the the 3 with Toby Maguire were good films.

CNN Video shows the suspect getting out of his vehicle carrying a longboard, which he uses in a pathetic getaway attempt.Police were able to catch up with him when a celebrity entered the chase. Luis "Lou" Pizarro, who starred in the now-cancelled truTV show, Operation Repo, happened to be on the scene and cut off the suspect using a big red truck, CNN reports."I seen the guy running with a skateboard in his hand, and he's running from the cops ... and it was just instinct just to block the guy off, slow him down a little bit," Pizarro told ABC-7.The suspect was arrested without incident.

The 33-year-old actress recently shared a photo of herself from her Thailand vacation. In the photo, she is seen wearing a bikini and sarong. Alba is jumping in the air along with a friend, and she captioned the picture, "Jump for joy! #Thailand w my #BFF." According to Inquisitr, Alba's photo has triggered speculations in regard to her thin body frame.

But hours after a grand jury on Wednesday (Dec. 3) chose not to indict the New York City police officer who put Eric Garner into a fatal choke hold on Staten Island, those words came from none other than white evangelical leader Russell Moore.With back-to-back grand jury decisions that white police officers will not face charges in the deaths of unarmed black men, white Christians, including evangelicals, have grown more vocal in urging predominantly white churches to no longer turn a blind eye to injustice and to bridge the country’s racial divides.“It’s time for us in Christian churches to not just talk about the gospel but live out the gospel by tearing down these dividing walls not only by learning and listening to one another but also by standing up and speaking out for one another,” said Moore, president of the Southern Baptist Convention’s Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission.Other white evangelicals issued similar pleas.“I weep & pray for his family,” tweeted Danny Akin, president of Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, the day before he led a prayer for justice at his school in Wake Forest, N.C. “I beg our God to bring good out of this tragedy.”“’Love your neighbor as yourself’ means you picture yourself being choked and surrounded by five men while you say, ‘I can’t breathe,’” tweeted Scott Slayton, a white Southern Baptist pastor in Chelsea, Ala.The Rev. Alan Cross, a white pastor in Montgomery, Ala., said the publicized video of Garner’s choke hold has moved some white Christians to speak when they might not have after Officer Darren Wilson was cleared in the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. Cross is encouraging them to not just speak but listen to black people’s perspectives instead of only considering their own.“What often happens when white evangelicals try to speak into this is that we continue to think first in terms of our own position,” said Cross, a Southern Baptist and author of “When Heaven and Earth Collide: Racism, Southern Evangelicals, and the Better Way of Jesus.”“We should consider what people in the black community are saying, what are they going through, what is their experience.”Cross and others went online in the hours after the Garner decision to share how blacks were reacting. Author Barnabas Piper chose to post what others were saying about Ferguson and Garner on his blog, saying as “a young white man” he wasn’t in the best position to explain it all.“Put yourself in the shoes of the authors and immerse yourself in the experiences they describe,” he wrote. “You and I need to do so if we want to contribute anything to stopping injustice and closing the racial gap that exists.”The Rev. Barbara Williams-Skinner, co-chair of the National African-American Clergy Network, sees a growing interest among white Christians and others to speak up about the “pile on” of events capped with the Garner decision.“It just so offends the human spirit of people of every race that it compels them to act,” she said. “We don’t have to ask young white students and young white adults anymore to act. They understand … if the system will so violate the rights of people of color today, they will violate everybody’s rights tomorrow.”She had already witnessed an interest across races in the Ferguson events when her network’s planned letter on justice from black church leaders took on a more interracial feel.Even before the Garner decision, the progressive Christian group Sojourners had gathered 50 leaders, including black clergy and white evangelicals, for a retreat on Tuesday and Wednesday that included a “historic pilgrimage of racialized St. Louis” and a discussion of theological implications for “our nation’s broken justice system.”“There were white evangelicals in the room in Ferguson who were weeping when the Garner decision came down,” said the Rev. Jim Wallis, founder of the Washington-based social justice group.White Christians beyond evangelicalism added their voices to the outcry about the ruling.“The degradation and demeaning of black life must stop,” said Serene Jones, president of New York’s Union Theological Seminary. “What the hell kind of country do we live in?”Moore, noting some of the reaction after he called for racial reconciliation in the wake of the Ferguson strife, said some white Christians see no reason to speak up for better race relations.“I have gotten responses, and seen responses, that are right out of the White Citizens’ Council material from 1964 in my home state of Mississippi, seeing people saying there is no gospel issue involved with racial reconciliation,” he said in a podcast.He doesn’t agree with them.“Are you kidding me? There is nothing that is clearer in the New Testament than the fact that the gospel breaks down the dividing walls that we have between one another.”

http://hiking.about.com/od/Blog/fl/When-to-Call-for-a-Rescue.htm	Got a hiking emergency? Here's how to deal	Photo (c) Corey Hochachka / Design Pics / Perspectives / Getty ImagesNobody wants to have to call for a rescue, right? But it can happen to even the best-prepared hikers.So when should you call for help, and what should you do while you're waiting for help to arrive? As a general rule if you can walk out, do -- but if you decide you cannot do so safely, or if you've been injured and will need immediate aid even if you do make it to the trailhead, it's time to call. And if you know your trip plan has already triggered a rescue or will do so soon, it's time to head back to a place where you can communicate with rescuers and let them know a rescue is not, in fact, necessary.If you're lost and cannot get unlost, stay put. Wandering around will just make it harder for rescuers to find you. If you do decide that you must walk out, stick close to established routes -- those are the first places rescuers will look -- and communicate what you're doing to rescuers if possible. That could mean a cell phone call, or it could mean leaving obvious markers of your passage.Coping With an EmergencyMost rescue organizations need at least a little time -- sometimes a lot -- to mobilize depending on the situation, and once they're moving it can still take hours to carry out a remote wilderness rescue. If you're in stay-put mode, there are some proactive things you can do to make yourself safer and more comfortable while you wait.Aside from tending to your basic survival needs, having something to do makes it a lot easier to stay calm as you wait for rescue -- and staying calm and keeping your wits about you that matters more than carrying all the emergency supplies in the world.Get Your Mind in the GameSometimes you have to act fast in an emergency. But acting haphazardly or out of panic isn't going to help you at all. So as soon as you can, follow a version of the STOP acronym you'd use if you were lost:Stop and take stock of your situation. Think about your options, and identify which immediate needs must be met first. (More on that in a second.) Observe your surroundings, and take stock of all the resources available to you. Everything in your pack, and everything around you, can be a tool to help you. (Hopefully you're carrying an emergency kit, but this holds true even if you're not.) Plan your course of action, then act. Calm, purposeful action gives you infinitely better odds than random, anxiety-driven efforts.Tend to Your Basic NeedsIn a wilderness setting, survival and comfort are both tied to your most basic needs: water, shelter, heat and food (not necessarily in that order). If you're injured, evaluating the injury and applying appropriate first aid zooms straight to the top of your priority list. Even if you are injured and not very mobile, you can take steps to try and meet some your survival needs:WaterGot a water filter and access to a water source? Use it. No filter? Collect water and boil it. No water source? How about setting up a plastic sheet to catch rain or dew?ShelterBuilding a full-on shelter, even something as simple as a debris mound, takes a surprising amount of time and energy. But even if you're injury and relatively immobile, you can still problem-solve. So make full use of the most important survival tool you own: Your brain.Here are some examples of quick, easy things you can do to help yourself out: Wrap up in a space blanket or garbage bag to conserve warmth, or set either one up above you to shed rain. (Here are five other ways a garbage bag can save your life.) Stuff a garbage bag full of leaves or other debris to make an improvised sleeping pad. Crawl under a tree so its boughs can shelter you, but not before leaving a highly visible signal so rescuers will know where to find you.HeatFire can give you an immense psychological boost, but depending on the particulars of your situation it may not be your best immediate source of heat. If you can spare it, eat something from your food stash -- the fattier the better, because it'll help fuel sustained body heat. If others are with you, huddle together beneath shelter to share body heat. When you do build a fire, make the most of it by positioning yourself between the fire and a surface that will reflect the heat back toward you.FoodExcept for its role in sustaining body heat, finding food usually takes a back seat to the more immediate needs of water, shelter and heat -- especially if you're hurt and not fully mobile. Foraging is an excellent survival skill but if you are at all in doubt about what is and isn't safe, err on the side of caution; eating poisonous or toxic foods can leave you seriously debilitated, just when you need the fullest grasp of your abilities. All things being equal, you can get by on very limited food for a week or more.
http://news.yahoo.com/russian-scientist-spies-mountain-sized-asteroid-heading-way-170022867.html	Russian scientist spies mountain-sized asteroid heading our way	A Russian astrophysicist says his team has located a huge, mountain-sized asteroid whose orbit crosses the Earth’s every three years. Even though experts say the giant object, known as 2014 UR116, poses no immediate threat of collision, its unexpected discovery underscores how little is still known about asteroids and their unpredictable orbits. Vladimir Lipunov, a professor at Moscow State University, announced the find in a short documentary, “Asteroid Attack,” posted on the website of the Russian Space Agency on Sunday. Mr. Lipunov says the asteroid, which he calculates is 370 meters in diameter, could hit the Earth with an explosion 1,000 times greater than the surprise 2013 impact of a bus-sized meteor in Russia. That object entered Earth’s atmosphere over the city of Chelyabinsk, resulting in a series of ferocious blasts that blew out windows and damaged buildings for miles around. MoreLike this:

The images are made from what the search vessels are recording during the search for the plane, as seen in this video below:The video was created after data was gathered via a multibeam sonar that provided high resolution data.“The image is a synthetic aperture sonar acoustic image of the seafloor gathered by GO Phoenix,” reads a statement from the agency, according to News.com.au. “This is indicative of the resolution and quality of the data and that it is revealing important detail of the seafloor.”The GO Phoenix and Furgo Discovery ships are working to scan the ocean floor, which is about 6,000 meters (3.7 miles) beneath the ocean’s surface. There’s a lack of data about the southern Indian Ocean’s floor.More than 9,000 square kilometers has been searched so far, which is about 16 percent of the overall search area.“In addition to locating the aircraft, the underwater search aims to map the MH370 debris field in order to identify and prioritise the recovery of specific aircraft components, including flight recorders, which will assist with the Malaysian investigation,” said a statement.“The equipment used on the vessels is providing extraordinary data.”A synthetic aperture sonar acoustic image shows sea floor of the Indian Ocean (ATSB)Meanwhile, there’s been more theories about what happened to the missing plane, which disappeared March 8 with 239 passengers–mostly Chinese nationals–on board. It was flying from Kuala Lumpur.Jeff Wise, the author of “Extreme Fear: The Science Of Your Mind In Danger,” theorized about a possible hijacking earlier this month. He’s also a member of The Independent Group, which is an organization of technical and aviation experts and has written for Slate magazine.Wise says Russian-backed hijackers took the plane to the Central Asian nation of Kazakhstan.“The idea that MH370 might have wound up in Kazakhstan is not new. In the days after MH370’s disappearance, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak personally appealed to Kazakhstan’s president, the Soviet-era strongman Nursultan Nazarbayev, to allow Malaysia to set up a search operation in the country. Kazakhstan never responded. After Inmarsat concluded that the plane had gone south, the matter was dropped,” he wrote on his website.“If Russia has the savvy to plan an insanely complex special operation, they also have a track record of implementing such schemes. A week before MH370 vanished, Russia began infiltrating special forces into the Ukrainian territory of Crimea, eventually annexing it. The operation was designed to look like an internal uprising, but the personnel and equipment belonged to elite Russian military units,” he then stated.

One noticeable trend? The tartan kilt, which was seen on both actor David Hasselhoff and rapper Redfoo—and probably worn in homage to the show's first return to Scotland since the 2003 ceremony in Edinburgh.Kilts aside, the best looks of the MTV EMAs red carpet spoke more to classic dresses and clever silhouettes. Take British reality star Vicky Pattison, who caught our attention on the carpet in an iridescent, curve-hugging black gown. Actress Jena Malone went for simple and flirty in a navy tweed dress with a flattering A-line silhouette. Malone complemented the look with patent leather pumps and a fiery, no-fuss tousled bob.NEWS: See all the 2014 MTV EMAs red carpet arrivalsAriana Grande went for a very grown-up style on the carpet: No cat ears in sight! The singer, who opened the show with a performance of "Problem," wore a sweeping navy gown with sexy key-hole cutouts.English songstress Alesha Dixon wowed in an airy, printed shirt-dress and sexy cage booties. The singer's pin-straight locks and bright violet lips sealed her spot for best look of the night.NEWS: See the 2014 MTV EMAs winners listGetty ImagesAnd onto the red carpet misses: Supermodel Jourdan Dunn made a sexy appearance on the carpet, but her dress was missing a good few inches of fabric (almost as short as the thigh-bearing minidress that Ashley Monroe wore during her performance at the 2014 CMAs). The slit-to-belly-button number was a bit too shapeless on Dunn's svelte figure.Redfoo's kilt was overpowered by the oversized combat boots, purple knee socks and metal-trim leather vest that accompanied it. The rapper also promised more than he could deliver by teasing fans on Twitter to guess what was #underfooskilt—from what we could discern, there was nothing more intriguing under there than a pair of white undies.Charli XCX's two-piece skirt suit was an interesting choice—but the leopard and fur platforms she wore were a little too much against the all-sequin ensemble. And finally, we're all for a good feathered accessory, but Kiesza's multihued feather dress was somewhat of a sensory overload.Who do you think deserves best and worst dressed of the night?PHOTOS: The 2014 MTV EMAs red carpet arrivals
http://www.fastcompany.com/3037949/innovation-agents/the-amazing-story-of-the-blind-engineer-who-is-also-a-triathlete	The Amazing Story Of The Blind Engineer (Who Is Also A Triathlete)	Patricia Walsh is one of those people who seems to excel at everything she does. After several years in a successful and coveted stint as an engineer at Microsoft, she left to join Austin, Texas-based mobile payment app Mozido—a job she loves—in 2013. A longtime marathon runner, Walsh completed her first triathalon in 2010 and began breaking records a year later. She launched a motivational speaking business and wrote a book.She’s also blind.Walsh lost most of her vision when she was 14 as the result of a pediatric brain tumor and subsequent complications from the surgery to remove it. Today, her field of vision is a six-degree "tunnel of light, dark and motion." She went from being a student on track to graduate from high school early finding it hard to read children’s books in Braille.The trauma of losing her vision took a toll on Walsh. Depressed, angry and frustrated, she was living with her father in northern Ontario, Canada. Then her father started having health issues, including two strokes and two heart attacks in less than a year. To cope with the trauma of losing her eyesight and to get herself healthier, she started running.She started on a trail near her house, keeping track of where she was by running with one foot on the edge of the trail. The first time, it was tough to figure out how to get back home. The second time, she left a rock as a marker and fell over it. But, soon, she was running a mile, then a few. Running gave her the confidence to finish high school and go on to college, land her job at Microsoft, and then further testing her athleticism.Photo via Blind AmbitionWalsh broke records in her second triathalon in 2011, besting the fastest men’s time by 55 minutes and the previous women’s best time by four hours. She was recruited to the U.S. Paratriathalon National Team and will compete when the paratriathalon makes its debut as a sport at the 2016 Paralympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. She is leaving her job at Mozido to devote full-time focus to promoting her book, Blind Ambition: How to Envision Your Limitless Potential and Achieve the Success You Want, training for the Paralympic Games, and lining up sponsors for her trip to the Paralympic Games. Walsh shares some of the lessons she’s learned throughout her many remarkable accomplishments.Walsh holds an undergraduate degree in computer science and electrical engineering from Oregon State University. She says it’s tough to make math accessible to blind people, especially advanced math, where seeing problems and figures is an important part of learning. Initially, her professors discouraged her, thinking she wouldn’t be able to do it."I went in and they were all trying to convince me I might fail at this. I told them, ‘I might fail, but we’re going to try it anyway and just see what happens,’ It was really a willingness to take a bet on [myself] and have some failures along the way," she says.Those same professors ended up becoming her champions and recommending her for the job she landed at Microsoft.Walsh routinely deals with people who are nervous around her because they’ve not been around someone with vision loss or who simply don’t understand her capabilities. People ask insensitive questions and say inappropriate things, such as saying she’s not "really blind" because she has some vision.Instead of letting the comments and questions get under her skin, Walsh sees herself as a patient teacher. By reacting with kindness and understanding to the people who say such things because they don’t know better, she avoids slipping into a state of anger and resentment—something that does no one any good."It is actually one of my biggest pet peeves and something that I find hurtful every time and in my opinion is really the prejudice of reduced expectations," she says.After losing her vision, Walsh could have gotten angry and bitter, but instead turned to running to help her deal with those emotions. Later, her father was ill and her apartment was burned down by an arsonist. Meanwhile, she had to finish her book, train for her sport, and protect her spot on the national team. The only way to keep going was to focus on what really mattered to her—changing the perception of athletes with disabilities from "participatory hobbyists" to hardcore competitors who are to be taken seriously. She says she could never do that if she got mired in negativity.When Walsh first ventured out onto that Ontario running path, she never could have dreamed that she’d compete in the Paralympic Games one day. She says that accomplishing the big goals is a matter of faithfully doing the work toward achieving them every day. It’s getting on a bus at 5:30 a.m. to go work out and jump in a pool of cold water, even when she doesn’t want to. But the only way to get better is to keep working. Stay in touch with what motivates you."The only way to [keep going] is by reminding yourself frequently why this is important to you, and it can’t be something superficial, it has to be something that honest-to-God means something to you at a heart level," she says.
http://news.yahoo.com/china-shows-off-stealth-fighter-101940905.html	China shows off new stealth fighter	Zhuhai (China) (AFP) - China's new stealth jet fighter rocketed skywards Wednesday as Beijing puts on an unprecedented display of openness -- and military force -- at the country's premier airshow.The black J-31 rose in a nearly vertical climb on take-off in Zhuhai before circling back and doing two rolls, in the aircraft's first announced public appearance.The plane's existence has been the subject of rumour and speculation for years, with photographs appearing increasingly frequently on military websites in recent months.Defence analysts say the J-31 is China's answer to the United States' F-35, though the Chinese jet lags behind the American one technologically.The fighter's Chinese name is "Falcon Eagle" and it is manufactured by a unit of Aviation Industry Corp. of China (AVIC), whose defence arm uses the slogan: "We are making the best weapons for guardians of the peace."The plane's debut comes amid tensions between China and its neighbours over territorial disputes, particularly Japan which has feuded with Beijing over a group of islands in the East China Sea.China's air force said the display of military might at the airshow showed the intention to build a strong country.View gallery A J-31 stealth fighter taxis after a flight at the Airshow China 2014 in Zhuhai, south China's G …The People's Liberation Army (PLA) air force "will make unremitting efforts to realise dreams of a strong China and powerful armed forces", read a sign alongside an array of eight warplanes at the airshow."The display... demonstrates the strength and confidence of (the) PLA Air Force to fulfil missions and achieve world peace."China has steadily increased its defence budget for years, with funding projected to rise more than 12 percent to $132 billion in 2014.

http://www.foxnews.com/science/2014/11/14/extraordinary-5000-year-old-human-footprints-discovered/	Extraordinary' 5,000-year-old human footprints discovered	A 5,000-year-old human footprint discovered on the Danish island of Lolland. (Lars Ewald Jensen/Museum Lolland-Falster)When a pair of fishermen waded into the frigid waters of the southern Baltic Sea about 5,000 years ago, they probably didn't realize that the shifting seabed beneath their feet was recording their every move. But it was.The long-lost evidence of that prehistoric fishing trip two sets of human footprints and some Stone Age fishing gear was recently discovered in a dried up fjord, or inlet, on the island of Lolland in Denmark. There, archaeologists uncovered the prints alongside a so-called fishing fence, a tool that dates back to around 3,000 B.C.Archaeologists have found fishing fences before, but the footprints are the first of their kind discovered in Denmark, according to Terje Stafseth, an archaeologist with the Museum Lolland-Falster, who helped excavate the ancient prints. [See photos of the Stone Age human footprints]"This is really quite extraordinary, finding footprints from humans," Stafseth said in a statement. "Normally, what we find is their rubbish in the form of tools and pottery, but here, we suddenly have a completely different type of trace from the past, footprints left by a human being."For more than a year, Stafseth and his colleagues have been racing against the clock to collect artifacts and other historical objects from Denmark's past before they disappear forever. In the next year or so, construction is slated to begin on the Fehmarn Belt Fixed Link, an underwater tunnel that will connect Lolland with the German island of Fehmarn. The tunnel will be built with several above-ground facilities that will cover up dried fjords, including the one where the footprints and fishing equipment were found, according to Lars Ewald Jensen, the Museum Lolland-Falster's project manager for the Fehmarn Link project.Those dried up inlets, as well as other areas of Lolland, are a good place to look for artifacts because these areas weren't always dry, Jensen told Live Science. In fact, the fjords used to be the backdrop for Stone Age people's daily water activities, such as fishing and offering sacrifices to the sea, he said.But in 1872, the Baltic Sea flooded, killing 80 people on the island of Lolland alone, Jensen said. To protect against future storm surges, a dyke was completed in 1877 that spans about 37 miles of Lolland's southern coast. The project left the fjords dry.The Stone Age footprints were likely formed sometime between 5,000 B.C. and 2,000 B.C., Jensen said. At that time, the water level of the Baltic Sea was rising due to melting glaciers in northern Europe. Also at that time, prehistoric people were using these inlets as fishing grounds.These individuals constructed elaborate traps, called fishing fences, to catch their prey. The wooden fences were built in sections several feet wide thin switches of hazel suspended between two larger sticks and the sections were lined up consecutively to form one long, continuous trap. The trap was placed in the shallow water of the fjord, which would be flooded with the incoming tide, the archaeologists said. When the fishermen wanted to move their gear, they would pluck the sections of the fence from the claylike floor of the fjord and move the whole apparatus to a new location. [Top 10 Mysteries of the First Humans]"What seems to have happened was that at some point they were moving out to the [fish fence], perhaps to recover it before a storm," Jensen said. "At one of the posts, there are footprints on each side of the post, where someone had been trying to remove it from the sea bottom."The footprints around the post, as well as several others in the general area, were likely preserved in time thanks to the stormy weather. As the fishermen struggled to move their gear, their feet sunk deeper into the floor of the fjord and were covered by sand stirred up by the incoming ocean surge. The recovered footprints feature fine layers of mud and sand, neatly positioned one atop the other, Jensen said.The archaeologists said the footprints must have been made by two different people, since one set of prints is significantly smaller than the other. Jensen and his team are now making imprints, or flat molds, of the footprints to preserve these ancient signs of life.In addition to the human tracks, the team uncovered several skulls belonging to domestic and wild animals on the beach near the fjord. The researchers said the skulls were likely part of offerings made by local farmers, who inhabited the region from around 4,000 B.C."They put fragments of skulls from different kinds of animals [on the sea floor], and then around that they put craniums from cows and sheep," Jensen said. "At the outermost of this area, they put shafts from axes. All in all, it covers about 83 square yards. It's rather peculiar."Copyright 2014 LiveScience, a TechMediaNetwork company.

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/12/03/why-the-heart-of-the-las-vegas-strip-may-soon-be-b.aspx	Why the Heart of the Las Vegas Strip May Soon Be Bankrupt	The Las Vegas Strip could be heading to its largest bankruptcy ever. Image source: public domainLas Vegas has made more than a few losers in its day but it's not usually the house that ends up going broke. But that may be exactly what's happening in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip.  One of the biggest buyouts ever attempted was pulled off in Las Vegas when Apollo Global and TPG Capital bought Harrah's Entertainment for $30.7 billion in 2008. Billions of dollars in debt was piled onto Harrah's -- or Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ: CZR  ) as it's known today -- balance sheet and before long the bet started going bad. The recession devastated Las Vegas' gaming revenue and an expansion of regional gaming around the country sank any recovery hopes Caesars had. Now, it's becoming apparent Caesars may succumb to over $25 billion in debt.  The impact on Las Vegas could be significant considering the fact that Caesars and its subsidiaries own nearly half of the Las Vegas Strip. Caesars owns its namesake Caesar's Palace as well as most of the property from Planet Hollywood all the way down to Harrah's Las Vegas. The properties make up the heart of the Las Vegas Strip and unless there's a solution worked out soon they may be in bankruptcy just after the turn of the new year.  How Caesars Entertainment got here A highly leveraged balance sheet, the recession, and expansion of regional gaming was only part of the problem for Caesars Entertainment. After the company went public, it began splitting off subsidiaries like Caesars Acquisition Company (NASDAQ: CACQ  ) to own its most valuable assets, leaving most of the debt with the "old" Caesars. The start of this dizzying structure can be seen in the image below from a presentation late last year.A look at Caesars' corporate structure as proposed late last year. Image source: Caesars EntertainmentFor Caesars, the problem creating so many subsidiaries is that debt holders who financed the company were intentionally cut out from the valuable assets as they were transferred to new companies. This would be like getting a mortgage to buy a home and then jacking up the home and moving to new land, leaving the bank with no collateral but the land where a house once sat.Why Caesars is drowning in debt None of this would be a problem if Caesars was able to pay its bills, but with $25 billion in debt and losses mounting every quarter the company can only pay its bills as long as it can get new debt. That's a problem now because at least four creditors have claimed Caesars defaulted when it transferred assets to new subsidiaries, which would trigger a default of all of its debt.Caesars is aware of this and has been negotiating with creditors to refinance debt through new debt and equity offerings. But those talks reportedly broke down earlier this week and low level creditors were never happy with a proposed agreement.Wynn Las Vegas and The Venetian Las Vegas are both more profitable than any of Caesars' resorts. Image source: The Motley FoolIf creditors don't agree to refinance debt Caesars could be forced into bankruptcy, the largest we've seen in Las Vegas. Given the massive debt load and questions surrounding the legality of the company's new legal structure I wouldn't doubt that's where we're heading.How this will impact the Las Vegas Strip The impact of a Caesars Entertainment bankruptcy on Las Vegas could be as small as a ripple or as big as a tidal wave.There may be minimal short-term impact felt if creditors who Caesars owe money agree to restructure debt, take equity in the company, and don't force a protracted negotiation. But tensions between debt holders and Caesars are heating up and they may force a more complete breakdown of the company.If Caesars is forced to break up into smaller pieces or sell off assets we could see a reshaping of The Strip. We could see valuable assets sold to rivals with strong balance sheets and underperforming assets could be sold to someone looking to demolish them for a new megaresort.A bankruptcy of Caesars Entertainment could bring a wave of change to the Las Vegas Strip but no matter what happens the heart of The Strip will likely change forever. Caesars can't keep its business afloat with $25 billion of debt and by the end of 2015 the company will likely look very different than it does today.1 great stock to buy for 2015 and beyond 2015 is shaping up to be another great year for stocks.

http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/04/27/pentagon-ammunition-sen-tom-carper-gao-waste/8145729/	Report: Pentagon to destroy $1B in ammunition	WASHINGTON — The Pentagon plans to destroy more than $1 billion worth of ammunition although some of those bullets and missiles could still be used by troops, according to the Pentagon and congressional sources.It's impossible to know what portion of the arsenal slated for destruction — valued at $1.2 billion by the Pentagon — remains viable because the Defense Department's inventory systems can't share data effectively, according to a Government Accountability Office report obtained by USA TODAY.The result: potential waste of unknown value."There is a huge opportunity to save millions, if not billions of dollars if the (Pentagon) can make some common-sense improvements to how it manages ammunition," said Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., and chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. "Despite years of effort, the Army, Navy and Air Force still don't have an efficient process for doing something as basic as sharing excess bullets. This Government Accountability Office (GAO) report clearly shows that our military's antiquated systems lead to millions of dollars in wasteful ammunition purchases."The Army and Pentagon, in a statement, acknowledged "the need to automate the process" and will make it a priority in future budgets. In all, the Pentagon manages a stockpile of conventional ammunition worth $70 billion.The effect of inaccurate accounting of ammunition for troops at war was outside the scope of the study. However, there were limited supplies at times of .50-caliber machine gun and 9mm handgun ammunition at the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to a senior military officer who spoke on condition of anonymity to talk about the issue."We simply cannot afford this type of waste and ineffectiveness," Carper said. "The (Pentagon) has a responsibility to efficiently manage its ammunition stocks, not only because it is important to be fiscally responsible, but also because our antiquated ammunition inventory systems can shortchange our war fighters and compromise their ability to complete their mission."Other key findings from the report:• The services have inventory systems for ammunition that cannot share data directly despite working for decades to develop a single database. Only the Army uses the standard Pentagon format; "the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps operate with formats that are obsolete."• The services hold an annual conference to share information about surplus ammunition and swap bullets and other munitions as needed. Data about ammunition left over after the meeting disappears from the books, resulting in an unknown amount of good bullets headed to the scrap heap.• The Army, although required by regulation, had not reported annually on its missile stockpile until last month, shortly before the GAO study was to be released.The report illustrates the obsolete nature of the Pentagon's inventory systems for ammunition. A request for ammunition from the Marine Corps, for example, is e-mailed to the Army. The e-mail is printed out and manually retyped into the Army system because the services cannot share data directly. Not only is this time consuming, but it can introduce errors — by an incorrect keystroke, for example.Waste, buying new ammunition while usable stockpiles exist, can occur "because the Army does not report information on all available and usable items," the report states. The annual conference among the services — although it saves about $70 million per year, according to the Pentagon — is inadequate. The services, in fiscal year 2012, exchanged 44 million items, including 32 million bullets for machine guns and pistols."Specifically, the Army's report does not include information from prior years about usable ammunition that was unclaimed by another service and stored for potential foreign military sales or slated for potential disposal," the report says.Missiles are another source for concern, the report notes. The Army has an inventory of missiles, including Stingers, Javelins and Hellfires, that has totaled more than $14 billion in recent years. Hellfire missiles have been a weapon of choice for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and in the CIA-run Predator and Reaper drone missions to kill terrorists in places like Yemen.The GAO found that the Army and its missile command "do not contribute to required annual report." The reason, Army officials told investigators, is that it "rarely has items to offer for redistribution."Without its cooperation, the Army "risks others services spending additional funds to procure missiles that are already unused and usable in the Army's stockpile."The Army, in a statement, said that it began offering that information to the other services last month.In its recommendations, the GAO urged Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to require the Army to make known information on all available for use by all services.Follow @tvandenbrook on Twitter.Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1lX5mFK
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/11/19/utah-revives-plan-for-executions-by-firing-squad/20996329/	Utah revives plan for executions by firing squad	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Ten years after banning the use of firing squads in state executions, Utah lawmakers on Wednesday endorsed a proposal to allow the practice again to avoid problems with lethal-injection drugs.The proposal from Republican Rep. Paul Ray of Clearfield would call for a firing squad if the state cannot obtain the lethal injection drugs 30 days before the scheduled execution.Utah dropped firing squads out of concern about the media attention, but Ray said it's the most humane way to execute someone because the inmate dies instantly."We have to have an option," Ray told reporters Wednesday. "If we go hanging, if we go to the guillotine, or we go to the firing squad, electric chair, you're still going to have the same circus atmosphere behind it. So is it really going to matter?"After a 20-minute discussion, an interim panel of Utah lawmakers approved the idea on a 9-2 vote Wednesday. The proposal still needs to go through the full legislative process once lawmakers convene for their annual session in January.Rep. Mark Wheatley, a Democrat from Murray, voted against the measure because he said Utah doesn't have a problem that needs to be fixed.Santaquin Republican Rep. Marc Roberts, who cast the other opposing vote, said he didn't think the proposal was needed and is unsure of his own view on capital punishment.Under current Utah law, death by firing squad is only an option for criminals sentenced to death before 2004. It was last used in 2010.Ray said his proposal gives Utah flexibility if it's unable to obtain the drugs needed in a lethal injection.For years, states used a three-drug combination to execute inmates, but European drugmakers have refused to sell them to prisons and corrections departments out of opposition to the death penalty.That move has led states to use different types, combinations and doses of lethal drugs, but those methods have been challenged in court.Because of the challenges with the drugs and prolonged executions earlier this year in Oklahoma and Arizona, lawmakers in Utah and elsewhere are looking for alternatives.Critics have said the firing squads are not without risks and will renew the intense media attention Utah had wanted to avoid.Despite being restrained, an inmate could still move or the shooters could miss the heart, causing a slower, painful death, according to the Washington, D.C.,-based Death Penalty Information Center, which opposes capital punishment.One such case appears to have happened in Utah's territorial days back in 1879. According to newspaper accounts, a firing squad missed Wallace Wilkerson's heart and it took him 27 minutes to die.Utah stopped allowing inmates to choose a firing-squad execution in 2004, citing the excessive media attention it gave prisoners. Those sentenced to death before the law changed still have the option of choosing it.It was last used in 2010 when Ronnie Lee Gardner was executed by five police officers with .30-caliber Winchester rifles.Gardner was the third person to die by firing squad after the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. Several other inmates on Utah's death row have opted to die by gunfire, but they are all years away from exhausting the appeals of their death sentences, according to the state attorney general's office.Jean Hill with the Catholic Diocese of Salt Lake City spoke Wednesday in opposition to the proposal and the death penalty in general, telling lawmakers that there is no humane way to kill someone."These may be heinous crimes that have been committed, and the idea of revenge is a normal human emotion," Hill said. "But the state's role is not to take revenge on people."

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/12/01/billionaires-are-dumping-these-3-stocks.aspx	Billionaires are Dumping These 3 Stocks	Billionaires buy and sell stocks for a variety of reasons, and the investing public is very interested in what the "big dogs" are doing and why.We asked three of our analysts to give their take on three stocks being sold by billionaires. Here is what they had to say.Leo Sun: Carl Icahn has been selling Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX  ) stock over the past two years. Icahn owned about 5.4 million shares in October 2012. By the third quarter of this year, Icahn held only 1.4 million shares, dropping his stake in the leading video streamer from nearly 10% to 3.7%. Since Icahn's original disclosure, shares of Netflix have rallied 365%.Icahn's sales could be simple profit taking, or it could be a warning that Netflix stock has limited upside potential. In October, the stock plunged 26% in a single day after Netflix's third-quarter subscriber numbers (37.2 million U.S./15.8 million international) both fell short of its original forecasts. The company, though, met Wall Street forecasts with $1.41 billion in revenue and earnings of $0.96 per share.Looking ahead, some key challenges could hurt Netflix. Time Warner and CBS' plans to enter the streaming market could lead to a bidding war on syndicated content, which could cause Netflix's expenses to soar and customers' monthly rates to rise. Netflix also isn't a cheap stock -- even after dropping 22% over the past three months, shares still trade at nearly 100 times earnings.George Budwell: Last week, we learned that a number of hedge funds either dramatically reduced or completely sold off their holdings in top biotech Celgene  (NASDAQ: CELG  ) , according to 13F filings with the SEC. George Soros' fund, for instance, sold its entire stake of 688,000 shares during the third quarter -- even though the fund just opened this position in the second quarter. As such, I think it's a good time to consider why these leading hedge funds are dumping Celgene.I believe the culprits are Celgene's 37% rise over the last 12 months and its relatively high forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23. Put simply, Celgene looks fairly valued at current levels following this rapid growth spurt, suggesting that its shares might have limited upside in 2015. On the flip side, the Soros Fund, among others, poured into biotechs such as AbbVie, presumably because they are better positioned for a strong run next year in light of their markedly lower forward P/E ratios.I personally think Celgene remains a great company to own because of its stellar management and promising clinical pipeline. As such, I don't think it's worth following in the footsteps of these particular money managers on this one.Cheryl Swanson: Warren Buffett's holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, has been steadily trimming its stake in healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ  ) , to the point that it has shrunk to a small fraction of its peak in 2007.Berkshire owned more than 61 million shares of the 125-year-old company in 2007, but now has less than 327,100 shares left. While Buffett didn't declare dumping more J&J shares in Berkshire's latest 13F filing, the billionaire investor is also not rebuilding a position.That's worrisome, given that J&J raised its 2014 earnings forecast three times this year, driven by revenue gains from its new hepatitis C treatment, Olysio, which has brought in a stunning $2 billion in global sales. In addition, J&J's relatively new CEO, Alex Gorsky, has done a terrific job of rebuilding the company's reputation, which was once all but ruined by massive safety failures in household name products like Motrin and Tylenol.Gorksy has also been hard at work repositioning the company as a profitable global competitor, particularly in its pharmaceutical sector. Still, Buffett's last annual letter to shareholders left out J&J entirely. Is the legendary value investor in a mode of watchful waiting, looking for a pullback to rebuild, or planning a final exit? Right now, it's anyone's guess.Warren Buffett is afraid of this company's technology At the recent Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, Warren Buffett admitted this emerging technology is threatening his biggest cash-cow. Buffett's fear can be your gain. Only a few investors are embracing this new market, which experts say will be worth over $2 trillion.

It was BMW's analog finale before its digital overture. There was no noise enhancing fakery or torque-filling forced induction, it was good old-fashioned high-revving V8 witchcraft. Now it can be yours for much less than a new, base model BMW 4-series coupe.This BMW E92 M3 has a 414-horsepower V8 that redlines at an RPM that resembles a phone number. That German powerhouse is mated to a GETRAG 6-speed manual transmission which is one of the best and smoothest gearboxes ever made. In my opinion, this is BMW's naturally aspirated swan song, and what an spectacular one it is.This M3 looks like a barebones stripper version, which means that it has less to get in the way of your driving experience. Adding lightness is always a good thing in a car like this. It also has the added benefit of being a 1-owner, zero-accident, relatively low mileage example, with carfax history report available by the selling dealership. Although the interior and exterior color combo aren't the most desirable, it's a remarkably clean M3 for a price less than half of its original MSRP.The maintenance on this car is more expensive than a more pedestrian mode of transport, but not by much, and parts can be found for a reasonable price, pretty much anywhere online.

VATICAN CITY (AP) — American Cardinal Raymond Burke, who championed campaigns to deny Communion to Catholic politicians who support legalized abortion, was removed by Pope Francis from another top Vatican post on Saturday.The removal of Burke as head of the Holy See's supreme court was widely expected in church circles.While he was archbishop of St. Louis, from 2003-2008, he led fellow American bishops in campaigns to stop giving Communion to Catholic politicians who support legalized abortion. He has also questioned some of the pontiff's pronouncements and approaches.Last year Francis took Burke off the Vatican's powerful Congregation for Bishops, dealing with appointments of bishops worldwide.On Saturday he transferred Burke from the Vatican court job to the largely ceremonial post of Patron of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, a charity whose activities include hospitals and residences for the elderly around the world.Burke, at 66, would have still had a good decade to continue serving in high-profile Vatican posts.His strident discourse and preference of fancy, old-fashioned vestments contrast starkly with the informal, chatty tone and simple, almost Spartan style Francis has established for his papacy.Last month, Burke marshaled conservative criticism against the possibility the Vatican may loosen up rules that ban Communion for divorced, remarried Catholics.Francis has said that church hierarchy should not focus so much on abortion and same-sex marriage but instead concentrate on making the church a more welcoming place. Meanwhile, Burke has said to a Catholic broadcaster that "we can never talk enough" against abortion and same-sex marriage.He has also questioned Francis' denunciation of excesses of capitalism.ALSO ON THE HUFFINGTON POST LISTEN: WHAT DOES POPE FRANCIS REALLY WANT FOR THE CHURCH?

http://news.yahoo.com/couple-cleared-daughters-death-attend-church-173052374.html	Couple cleared of daughter's death attend church	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) — An American couple detained in Qatar before being cleared in the death of their 8-year-old daughter attended a church service in Southern California where worshippers greeted them with a standing ovation.Matthew and Grace Huang were called to the dais at the Lake Avenue Church in Pasadena shortly after the 9 a.m. service began. The couple stood in front of the congregation hugging their two surviving children amid sustained claps and cheers.Matthew Huang briefly addressed the parishioners, saying he was thankful to be home and among friends."The situation the past two years was extremely difficult," he said. "It's taught us a lot about patience."The Huangs gained international attention when Qatari authorities arrested them in January 2013 on charges of starving their African-born daughter, Gloria, to death.The couple, who are of Asian descent, had adopted Gloria in Ghana when she was 4 years old, and are the parents of two other adopted, African-born children.View gallery Matthew, second right and Grace Huang, right, accompanied by their sons, celebrate with Pastor Grego …The Huangs spent nearly a year in jail and were convicted of child endangerment.

The Huangs said Gloria suffered from medical problems complicated by an eating disorder that was the result of her impoverished early years in Africa.The Huangs spent several months behind bars before their case was heard for the first time in November 2013.The couple and their children moved to Qatar in 2012 after Matthew Huang was hired to work as an engineer as part of preparations for the 2022 World Cup in Doha.Waybright said the church would make a special offering collection next Sunday for money to help the Huangs get back on their feet.___Associated Press writer Paul Elias in San Francisco contributed to this report.
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/10/03/orioles-rally-past-tigers-7-6-take-2-0-alds-lead/20972302/	Orioles rally past Tigers 7-6, take 2-0 ALDS lead	BALTIMORE (AP) - The Baltimore Orioles once again battered Detroit's shaky bullpen and pushed the Tigers to the brink of playoff elimination.Pinch-hitter Delmon Young delivered another big postseason hit, lining a three-run double during a four-run rally in the eighth inning that sent the Orioles over the Tigers 7-6 Friday for a 2-0 lead in the best-of-five AL Division Series.J.J. Hardy made a nifty slide home, touching the plate with his hand barely ahead of the tag, for the go-ahead run. A Camden Yards crowd that saw the O's fall behind Justin Verlander 5-2 in the early going erupted in an orange wave.Now Baltimore will try for a sweep in Game 3 Sunday at Detroit, when Miguel Gonzalez starts against the Tigers' third straight Cy Young winner in David Price.A day after the Orioles battered Detroit relievers while scoring eight runs in the eighth for a 12-3 win, they came back from a three-run deficit.Orioles fans cheered when Joba Chamberlain came in to pitch the eighth with a 6-3 lead - the crowd knew that Detroit's bullpen was beleaguered.Chamberlain hit Adam Jones with a pitch and gave up a single to Nelson Cruz, setting up Steve Pearce's RBI single.Joakim Soria entered and walked J.J. Hardy to load the bases for Young.Young quickly cleared them with a liner into the left-field corner. J.D. Martinez bobbled the carom for an instant, and Hardy never broke stride in scoring.Young went 10 for 20 as a pinch hitter during the regular season. He also was the AL championship series MVP in 2012 - for the Tigers - when they swept the Yankees.In the top of the eighth, baserunning also was a key point. Miguel Cabrera was thrown out at the plate when he tried to score on Victor Martinez's RBI double with no outs.Zach Britton got three straight outs for the save.Soria wound up with the loss.The defeat left Detroit's bid to reach the ALCS for a fourth straight year in serious jeopardy. The Tigers wasted home runs by J.D. Martinez and Nick Castellanos, along with a solid start by Verlander.Rooted on by girlfriend Kate Upton, Verlander left in the sixth with a 5-3 lead. He appeared to try to talk first-year manager Brad Ausmus out of being pulled.Brad Brach got the win, getting two outs in the eighth after Kevin Gausman allowed one run and three hits in 3 2-3 innings.Detroit trailed 2-0 before peeling off five straight hits against Wei-Yin Chen. Torii Hunter singled, Cabrera doubled and Victor Martinez delivered an RBI single.J.D. Martinez and Castellanos hit consecutive home runs, the second day in a row that Detroit's done it.Chen lasted only three more batters in his shortest outing since June 28 and left down 5-2.Baltimore got a run back in the bottom half with a two-out RBI single by Hardy, and the Orioles turned a nifty 5-4-3 double play against Cabrera in the fifth that began with a diving stop by Ryan Flaherty.Nelson Cruz led off the sixth with a single to chase Verlander. Anibal Sanchez entered, and Cruz advanced on a groundout. But that turned out to be the first of six straight batters that Sanchez retired.Sanchez had pitched only one inning since Aug. 8 while recovering from a pectoral strain. He led the AL in ERA last year and had been another starter for the Tigers before getting hurt.The game started shortly after noon, and the sellout crowd of 48,058 had plenty of enthusiasm left from the night before.The volume decreased, however, after Verlander began mowing down a potent lineup that one night earlier banged out 12 hits in a lopsided victory.He retired the first eight batters before Jonathan Schoop bounced a single up the middle. Nick Markakis then hit a 3-2 pitch off the roof of the grounds crew enclosure in right field.A replay confirmed the drive as a home run, ending Verlander's 32-inning scoreless streak in the ALDS. Markakis' first homer off the right-hander in 50 career at-bats came on Verlander's 50th pitch.The lead didn't last past the next half inning.TRAINER'S ROOMTigers: The saga of CF Rajai Davis (pelvic strain) took a downturn when he was replaced in the fourth inning by a pinch-runner. The reason for his departure was announced only as "tightness."UP NEXTTigers: Price owns a lifetime record of 7-3 against the Orioles. Cruz is 7 for 19 (.368) with two homers against the left-hander.Orioles: Gonzalez will make his second career postseason start Sunday, looking for a suitable encore to his performance in 2012 against New York (7 innings, 1 run). He's 0-2 with a 9.00 ERA in three lifetime starts against Detroit.
http://www.vox.com/2015/1/2/7480867/sweden-shows-the-right-way-to-respond-to-islamophobia	Thousands of people in Sweden show the right way to respond to Islamophobia	It's only January 2, but Sweden has already taken a strong lead in the competition for "most awesome country 2015" by showing how decent people should respond to Islamophobic violence. Thousands of people turned out in Stockholm today for a rally supporting Muslims, in response to arson attacks on three Swedish mosques last week.A mosque in the city of Eskilstuna had been firebombed on Christmas day, injuring five worshippers inside. A few days later, a second mosque in the southern city of Eslov was damaged in a fire that police say they suspect was also arson. And on New Years day, a mosque in Uppsala was hit by a molotov cocktail, but did not catch fire.The day after the Uppsala mosque was attacked, local residents "love bombed" it, covering the entrance of the building with paper hearts and messages of support.The demonstration and "love bombing" were a powerful way for ordinary Swedes to reject racism and show support for Muslims. But the march also carried broader political significance, because it showed that Swedes felt a duty to publicly reaffirm the country's identity as a place that is tolerant and welcoming towards immigrants.In many countries, anti-immigrant populism dominates the public conversation about immigration not because it necessarily represents the majority view, but because people with more moderate and tolerant views don't make it a priority to speak up publicly. These demonstrations suggest that Sweden may be different: thousands of people took to the streets to say that they are not willing to stay silent, and will not allow extremists to dominate the debate.And that's important, because the mosque attacks come at a time of rising tension over Islamophobia and immigration in Sweden. Omar Mustafa, the head of Sweden's Islamic Association, told Swedish newspaper The Local that he believes Islamophobia is getting worse. "It's not just on the internet, this is happening in real life," he said, noting that there had been 14 attacks on Swedish mosques in the last year.Anti-immigrant sentiment is also on the rise. The far-right Sweden Democrat party won 13 percent of the vote in a recent election after campaigning on an anti-immigration and anti-refugee platform. Last month, the Sweden Democrats nearly managed to cause the collapse of the center-left coalition government, and promised to make the next elections a referendum on immigration policy. However, on December 27 the government announced an eight-year agreement with center-right opposition parties that cut out the Sweden Democrats, preventing the far right party from forcing its agenda.The rise of Islamist extremism is also a growing concern in Sweden. It is estimated that the country has one of the highest rates of ISIS recruits per capita in Europe, and in November an ISIS defector claimed that the terrorist group has sleeper cells in Sweden awaiting orders.However, Sweden's government has refused to exploit fears of extremism for political gain. The Culture and Democracy minister, who marched in today's rally, said that Sweden is "still a paradise" for immigrants and that "knowledge is the best vaccination against prejudice."Prime Minister Stephen Löfven told the local TT news agency that "in Sweden no one should have to be afraid when they practice their religion," and promised to increase funding for security in places of worship.

http://www.cracked.com/blog/the-6-most-pathetic-dating-show-contestants-all-time/	The 6 Most Pathetic Dating Show Contestants of All Time	Every time I'm on a date with someone new, I wish that I could skip to when we've already broken up and are deciding whether or not to hide each other on Facebook or unfriend each other entirely. That would make things way easier.Have you ever been one of many dudes trying to get a girl's attention at a bar? Take that impotent, terrible frustration and put it in front of millions of people, and you have reality dating shows. But, since you're all Cracked readers, I assume that you snag the attraction of any lovely lady/handsome guy that walks by, because you're people of exquisite taste. These six things, not so much.#6. Christopher Mendoza -- Seducing CindyBryan Bedder/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty ImagesThe subject of Seducing Cindy, Cindy Margolis, was in the 2000 edition of the Guinness Book of World Records as the "most downloaded person" in 1999, a fact that the show wails at you as often as possible in a futile attempt to endear you to her. "MOST DOWNLOADED! MOST DOWNLOADED! GAH, ACCEPT HER!" As you might guess, the objective of the show is for Margolis to find true love. She spends most of her time making out with every contestant and then complains to the camera that she feels guilty about it, so I guess you're supposed to support her because she ... talks more than everyone else? Her only defining characteristics are "hot" and "older," so I guess the producers felt that by the time the finale rolled around we'd be Stockholm-Syndromed into digging her.Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images Hollywood personality type 48B1H-9Q.Enter contestant Christopher Mendoza, the human equivalent of a moist towelette, who arrives on the show only to immediately be mocked by the other contestants for absolutely no reason at all. The rest of the cast really doesn't like him, and they constantly let him know and confront him about it. This quickly draws the question: are the other cast members bullies, or am I missing something by not loathing him from the start? Eventually, you lean toward the latter answer. Mendoza has a gravitational pull of hatred. Every orbiting body around him seems to be thrust into wanting to curb-stomp him simply for being alive. If one of the cast members was revealed to be the reanimated flesh of Ted Bundy, people would make a toast to FrankenTed, because he isn't Mendoza.Mendoza, his face shaped like his own ass cheek, takes his lumps and then whines about it, never standing up for himself throughout the whole season. At a certain point, you'd think that there would be some kind of character arc for him, where he finally grows a backbone and yells through his mouthful of toilet water for the other guys to leave him alone. Sadly, it's not to be, and his hero's journey follows a flaccid trajectory all the way to getting sent home.His interactions with Margolis are equally depressing, as he can never quite muster the energy to have anything more than these moody, bleak confessionals with her. The other guys make the effort to at least brighten her day, but Mendoza is unable to get past figuratively offering to tongue-wash Margolis' diaper, should that be one of the challenges. His conversations are all full of sad dedications, where he promises to love her, something that never comes to fruition, as I imagine Margolis was too preoccupied with the rotting smell emanating from her own ovaries that flared up whenever Mendoza got too close.Via There's no reason for it, but I just punched my monitor out of sheer reflex.Mysanantonio.com#5. Rachel, Brittany, Lindsay -- Making Mr. RightVia YouTubeFor a dating show, the idea behind Making Mr. Right is needlessly complicated. Typically, all you have to do is stick a person in a room with 25 contestants who all want to bone that person and hope that the contestants end up calling each other "bitches" enough for ratings to stay high. In Making Mr. Right, we have three women who pose as matchmakers in order to evaluate the male contestants' behavior on dates, only to reveal, eight weeks later, that it was all a lie and that the matchmakers are actually the ones looking to find love. It's a masterful plan, Goldfinger, one that is completely undone by the beginning of the second fucking episode.It doesn't help the ladies' causes that they completely ignore the premise of the show as soon as they talk to the guys. Rather than try to act like authoritative love gurus, they fall apart, choosing favorites and leaving you to remember the other participants only when they are inevitably eliminated. I've never tried to pretend to be a date wizard in order to spy on people's intimate moments in the hopes of sleeping with one of those people, but my approach would be more subtle than "I like that shirt! That shirt looks good on you! If a date goes sour, we should hang out, because I like you!"Via "I love how psychotic you are! Have you ever eaten a baby?"YouTubeThe original premise of Making Mr. Right lasts a grand total of about 45 minutes before the dudes dismantle the ploy and basically use it as an excuse to flirt and make out with as many girls as possible before being eliminated. Meanwhile, Rachel, Brittany, and Lindsay watch all of it from their secret Bat Cave-esque monitor room, shocked. "How could he be doing this? I can't take this! How could our plans have gone so awry?"#4. Zaza -- Take Me OutVia YouTubeA dating show hosted by George Lopez needs a shot in the arm every once in a while. In between the greatest puns that a writing team devoted entirely to ending Lopez's career can create, and women whose only character traits seem to be "I am hoping to get laid as hell," the human attention span requires a healthy dose of crazy. Thus, like a gift from God, Zaza was handed to us, and Take Me Out rose above numbing mediocrity for a few minutes of every episode.The way the show works is that a man goes on stage, we're treated to various video packages showcasing him lifting weights and standing on boats and shit, and then female panelists individually choose to either stay in the game or vote themselves out. In the end, the dude picks between the unlucky women who have decided to give love a final, fatal effort. A more accurate title for Take Me Out would be Only 8 Percent of Women Like You.Via See those red lights of rejection? That is the world, son. YouTubeThat is the world.All in all, it's pretty lighthearted, which makes it that much easier for Zaza to transcend it completely. In the third episode, Zaza tries to explain to Lopez that a contestant reminds her of an ex, and instead of having his usual insipid banter with her like he does with the other girls, Lopez abandons her to wallow in the confusion of the audience. In the fourth episode, Zaza's buzzer breaks, so she attempts to remove her name card and hide behind her podium. In the fifth episode, she compares another contestant to an ex and Lopez bluntly asks her, "Why does he have to pay for your ex-boyfriend's mistakes?" Is it a joke? Is it Lopez attempting to provide some kind of emotional counseling for her? We'll never know, because he once again leaves her stuttering and struggling to make sense of the harsh reality that Take Me Out has provided for her.In the final episode of this terrible human experiment, Zaza, apparently afflicted by a bizarre form of Stockholm Syndrome, says that if she doesn't find a man tonight, she'll follow Lopez onto the "love lift," which is what the contestants enter the stage on, and "get a cookie from that cookie jar." Most of my knowledge of sexual metaphors comes from Lil Wayne songs, so as far as I can tell, Zaza is threatening to just bang Lopez if no one else suits her. The show ended with Zaza never finding her match, so we can only assume that she made good on her promise. And, Lopez: you have only yourself to blame.Next

http://news.yahoo.com/russia-g-20-were-warships-085535367.html	G-20 leaders agree on $2 trillion boost to growth	BRISBANE, Australia (AP) — Under pressure to jolt the lethargic world economy back to life, leaders of G-20 nations on Sunday finalized a plan to boost global GDP by more than $2 trillion over five years. The fanfare, however, was overshadowed by tensions between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Western leaders.The communique from the Brisbane summit of Group of 20 wealthy and emerging nations revealed that the plan for jumpstarting growth includes investing in infrastructure, increasing trade and the creation of a global infrastructure hub that would help match potential investors with projects.Leaders also aim to reduce the gap between male and female participation in the workforce by 25 percent by 2025, saying that would put 100 million more women in employment and reduce poverty.Speaking at the end of the summit, Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott said countries will hold each other to account by monitoring implementation of their commitments to boost growth.The G-20, criticized in recent years as being all talk and no action, was urged to deliver measurable results this year. Perhaps in response, the group said the International Monetary Fund and OECD will also play a role in monitoring progress and estimating the economic benefits of the growth plan.IMF managing director Christine Lagarde dismissed concerns that countries might fudge their growth figures, saying that while the monitoring isn't scientific, it's a thorough and detailed process."We'll make sure they keep their feet to the fire," she said.View gallery British Prime Minister David Cameron, left, and Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott hold a joint p …The G-20 communique says if the $2 trillion initiative is fully implemented, it will lift global GDP by 2.1 percent above expected levels by 2018 and create millions of jobs.Abbott said countries agreed on more than 800 new measures to spur the global economy, which the IMF describes as facing a "new mediocre.""People right around the world are going to be better off," he said.But the G-20, which represents around 85 percent of the global economy, faces an uphill struggle to implement its plan after international agencies downgraded their global growth forecasts in recent months. Growth in China and Japan has weakened and Europe is teetering on the brink of another recession.And experts warned that the countries would need to comply with every one of the 800 measures to achieve the 2.1 percent target, a virtually impossible task, given the difficulties they will inevitably face in pushing some of the policies through in their home countries."There are two questions: whether the specifics are credible and whether the political backing by leaders is convincing," said Thomas Bernes, an analyst with the Center for International Governance Innovation, a Canadian-based think-thank.View gallery Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, left, stands with British Prime Minister David Cameron as the …Abbott said the group had been most productive on the issue of trade, calling it the "key driver of growth." The leaders adopted reforms to streamline customs procedures and reduce regulatory burdens.Despite Australia's push to keep the summit focused on the economy, the meeting was largely overshadowed by tensions between Putin and Western leaders over the escalating conflict in Ukraine, where Moscow is supporting pro-Russian rebels in the country's east.Putin was the first leader to depart Australia, leaving before the communique was issued. He told reporters he left ahead of a final leaders' lunch because he wanted to rest before returning to work.Abbott has been particularly strong-worded in his criticism of Russia since a Malaysia Airlines plane was shot down in July over a part of eastern Ukraine controlled by Russian-backed separatists, killing all 298 on board. Australia lost 38 citizens and residents in the MH 17 disaster.Abbott said he and Putin had engaged in a "very robust" discussion about the situation in Ukraine."I utterly deplore what seems to be happening in eastern Ukraine," Abbott said. "I demand that Russia fully cooperate with the investigation, the criminal investigation of the downing of MH17, one of the most terrible atrocities of recent times."The G-20 also tackled the tricky issue of tax evasion by multinationals, declaring that profits should be taxed in the country where they are earned. There has been an ongoing effort by governments to crack down on the practice of big companies such as Google and Amazon moving profits earned in one country to others with lower tax rates.The G-20 endorsed a common reporting standard for the automatic exchange of tax information, which will begin by 2017 or 2018.Rights groups' reactions to the communique were relatively positive. Oxfam said it was happy the leaders tackled tax evasion, but called for a global tax summit where all countries would have a say in deciding fair tax rules.Tim Costello, chair of the Civil Society 20 group, or C-20, was relieved the communique specified that the beneficiaries of the additional growth would include the poor."We've taken a few small steps forward," he said. "Inclusive growth, which really requires the benefits to flow to jobs and to the poor and to women, is in the text, rather than flowing to profits and the top 5 percent."Thousands took part in more than two dozen protests throughout the weekend, but only a handful of arrests were reported. Tensions briefly flared on Sunday when Aboriginal rights activists burned an Australian flag, but police didn't intervene.___Associated Press writer Rod McGuirk contributed to this report.

http://dailyserving.com/2014/11/anton-perich-electric-paintings-1978-2014-at-postmasters-gallery/	Anton Perich: Electric Paintings 1978-2014 at Postmasters Gallery	“No, Wade Guyton did not invent a new paintbrush; Anton Perich did in 1978, when Guyton was six.” Thus combatively begins the press release for Anton Perich: Electric Paintings 1978–2014 at Postmasters Gallery. The un-cited author of the claim that “Wade Guyton invented a new paintbrush” is Jerry Saltz, writing on Guyton’s 2012 survey at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Of course, Saltz was aware that Guyton’s “invention” amounted to the novel appropriation of an existing technology: the commercial inkjet printer, through which the artist would pull his canvases. Perich can indeed better claim to have invented something. His “electric painting machine,” developed in the late 1970s, transfers projected images onto canvas using a motorized contraption that deposits lines of acrylic paint in rows according to the presence or absence of light. It was the painterly analog of the digital inkjet—a technology that had yet to become known, let alone available to, the masses at the time.Anton Perich. American Altarpiece, 2004; acrylic on canvas. Courtesy of Postmasters Gallery, New York.The similarities to Guyton mostly end there. Perich’s work registered a cultural–technological matrix in which the mechanics of paint/ink transfer were not nearly as important as the emergent aesthetics of video—a technology whose novelty had all but vanished by the time Guyton entered the scene. The Sony Portapak, introduced to the American market in 1967, first freed video recording from the studio. By the mid 1970s, Perich had swapped camera for camcorder as the ideal means to capture the bohemia of lower Manhattan with which he was enthralled. A 16-video lineup—one of the highlights of the Postmasters exhibition—offers an entrancing distillation of what are now comfortably referred to as New York City’s “bad old good old days.” In my intermittent viewing, I caught an impassioned discussion of the newly built World Trade Center, already monumental if only 45 percent rented (sound familiar?), a neon-bathed fashion show set to the music of Kraftwerk, and a hedonistic disco in which a lone female dancer, locking the gaze of Perich’s camcorder, is compelled to put on an exhibitionist display—one that ends abruptly when a nearby man decides to join in by dropping his trousers, effectively puncturing the recording device’s hypnotic bubble.This ability of the video camera to arrest its subjects, entombing them in a low-resolution field of glowing, glitchy horizontal bars, seems the undeniable referent for Perich’s paintings, thirty-six years of which are sampled in the present exhibition. For such an enduring project, precious little change or development is discernible in Perich’s approach over the years. The majority of the works feature female subjects (one notable exception is Andy Warhol, with whom Perich was well acquainted) in close-up—a hallmark of video recording, where poor resolution made distance shots undesirable. Perich’s “resolution” is variable: Some relatively older works like Thorvaldson (1995) use a gradation of line thicknesses to delicately model the subject’s features, even giving an illusion of depth, while some newer ones, like Misha Carbon (2013), employ crude, thick streaks, nearly dissolving the subject’s features in video-like static. Forays into complete abstraction are present at the beginning of Perich’s career, as in The Original Glitch (1978), a broken black rectangle suggestive of Malevich in the TV age, as well as in its present chapter, as in Ancient Music (2010), the bleeding color palette of which could draw comparisons to Guyton. In one of Perich’s best works, American Altarpiece (2004), abstract horizontal streaks are doubly coded, connoting both mundane video-recording imperfections and the transcendent color fields of a Rothko.Anton Perich. Ancient Music, 2010; acrylic on canvas. Courtesy of Postmasters Gallery, New York.The apparent stasis of Perich’s painting project may explain why writing on the artist has tapered over the years, failing to recognize his arguable place in the artistic genealogy behind the heavily publicized work of Wade Guyton. Postmasters’ delivery of Electric Paintings 1978–2014 as a show with significant art-historical stakes—a bracing departure from typically poker-faced gallery posturing—is warranted, but merely establishing Perich as the patriarch of inkjet-style painting would be a paltry feat. Rather, what is interesting about Perich’s work is how he used his printer-like approach to capture the historically unprecedented video gaze in paint, much like Guyton used his appropriated apparatus to explore an emergent aesthetics of personal computing. Who “invented the new paintbrush” is very much beside the point.Anton Perich: Electric Paintings 1978–2014 is on view at Postmasters Gallery through November 22, 2014.
http://www.inquisitr.com/1705997/kaley-cuoco-had-surgery-over-the-holidays-photo/	Kaley Cuoco Had Surgery Over The Holidays [Photo]	Kaley Cuoco received one of the worst Christmas gifts imaginable — The Big Bang Theory star had surgery over the holidays.On December 26, The Big Bang Theory star shared an Instagram photo that showed husband Ryan Sweeting comforting her after her surgery. As you can see, Kaley Cuoco had some work done — on her sinuses.“Coming out of sinus surgery and the first thing I see is my beautiful angel of a man, hes right there. Always. He’s taking amazing care of me ☺️i love my noodle. Hes perfection.”As the Inquisitr previously reported, Kaley Cuoco’s Instagram page is full of photos of her pre-Christmas partying. However, the photos she shared on Christmas day seem to indicate that she and Ryan Sweeting spent the holiday at home quietly celebrating with their lucky rescue dogs. Kaley probably didn’t hit the eggnog too hard, knowing that her surgery was scheduled for the next day.According to Everyday Health, sinus surgery improves sinus drainage, opens up nasal passages, and removes diseased tissue. One potential side effect of sinus surgery is a change in voice quality, so it will be interesting to see if Penny sounds different during the latter half of this season of The Big Bang Theory (Episode 14 and beyond).Cuoco probably won’t mind if she sounds a bit different after her sinus surgery. During a roundtable discussion with the Hollywood Reporter, Kaley revealed that she really hates the sound of her own voice — so much so that she has a hard time watching herself on The Big Bang Theory.“I hate the sound of my voice. I can hear it from a mile away — it’s nasally. Why do I talk like that? It freaks me out… I feel like I have the most annoying one. It’s hard for me to watch ‘Big Bang’. I TiVo it at home to support the show, but there are 37 episodes on there [I haven’t seen].”Kaley Cuoco might feel a bit bad if she ever watches Penny make fun of Leonard’s nose troubles in “The Septum Deviation,” a recent Big Bang Theory episode about Leonard undergoing surgery to correct a deviated septum. Cuoco’s sinus surgery is like a weird form of karma that she didn’t really deserve (the writers are the ones who came up with the nose jokes).Speaking of The Big Bang Theory, Spoiler TV recently shared the plot synopsis for the first episode of the show set to air after the holiday break. In “The Space Probe Disintegration,” Sheldon and Leonard will go dress shopping with Amy and Penny (the girls need someone to hold their purses while they peruse department store racks). Unfortunately, doing something they don’t want to do will make Leonard and Sheldon a bit testy, and the guys will get in a fight. Meanwhile, Wolowitz will try to distract Raj while he anxiously awaits data from a space probe.Kaley Cuoco and the rest of the Big Bang Theory gang will return to CBS on January 8.[Image credit: CBS]
http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/02/12/google-10-gigabit-internet-speeds/5421709/	Google working on 10 gigabit Internet speeds	Project to develop 'next generation' of the Internet is part of Google's broader obsession with speed, CFO saysSAN FRANCISCO – Google is working on technology that will provide data transfer speeds over the Internet that are many times faster than its current Google Fiber service in Kansas City, an executive at the online search giant said on Wednesday.Google Fiber offers data transfer speeds of 1 gigabit per second currently. But the company is already working on speeds of 10 gigabits per second, Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette said during the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet conference.Pichette called this the next generation of the Internet and said it was part of Google's broader, long-term obsession with speed.Faster speeds will increase the use of software as a service because users will be able to trust that critical applications that are data intensive will run smoothly over the Internet, he explained."That's where the world is going. It's going to happen," Pichette said. It may happen over a decade, but "why wouldn't we make it available in three years? That's what we're working on. There's no need to wait," he added.Google is not the only one working on this. Last year, researchers in the U.K. announced that they achieved data transmission speeds of 10 gigabits per second using "li-fi" a wireless Internet connectivity technology that uses light.Pichette has experience in this area. From early 2001 until July 2008, he was an executive at Bell Canada, which offers a fast, fiber optic Internet service to homes in that country.Google Fiber is currently available in Kansas City, but Google has said it is bringing the service to Austin, Texas and Pichette told analysts last year that the project is not a hobby for the company.On Wednesday he was asked whether Google Fiber will be coming to more cities. "Stay tuned," Pichette answered.Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1erDOlR
http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/3/7486869/netflix-international-block-vpn	VPN services report problems as Netflix denies crackdown	Update: Netflix has responded to reports of problems and claims any spike in VPN errors is an accident caused by a DNS change, not a wider crackdown.Netflix in the United States is not the same as Netflix in the rest of the world. Thanks to the intricacies of international law, the streaming service offers very different content, and sometimes none at all, based on where a subscriber lives. Some savvy users have been using tools to get around that problem, but it appears the company may finally be putting its foot down.Many users rely on VPNs — virtual private networks — or custom DNS settings to stealthily access Netflix as though they were in other regions. But Netflix may have started closing some of those loopholes. Torrent Freak reports that, in the past few weeks, popular VPN services like TorGuard have started seeing a spike in errors when users try to access Netflix.The problems don't appear to be widespread — the Netflix Android app, for one, may have updated to block DNS trickery — but there is a reasonable concern among users of the services that this is a prelude to a wider crackdown by Netflix. That might be unfortunate for people who rely on the services, but it's hardly surprising: as Netflix continues its global expansion, more and more money is on the line.
http://www.voanews.com/content/resaercher-most-civilian-drone-deaths-from-faulty-information/1622442.html	Researcher: Most Civilian Drone Deaths 'From Faulty Information'	A researcher who helped a U.N. team investigate drone strikes in Pakistan says most civilian deaths from the attacks were the result of bad intelligence.Imtiaz Gul runs the Center for Research and Security Studies in Islamabad and sent his own researchers into parts of Waziristan province between 2008 and 2011.Gul told VOA:"Most of the cases in which innocent people got killed basically resulted from faulty information, but not entirely," said Gul. "Nobody really told us, and I would presume a number of people our team spoke to also withheld information because usually people also tend to hide the truth even in such situations."Gul says fear is a major factor."These militants belong to a movement or to groups which see the United States as the oppressor, as the perpetrator, the violator of Pakistan sovereignty, so it is very difficult, extremely difficult for the people on the ground in the tribal areas to defend or support something that is killing members of the militant groups," he said.A statement from the head of the U.N. team, released Friday, has been drawing attention for condemning the United States' use of drones in Pakistan as a "violation of Pakistan's sovereignty."U.N. Special Envoy Ben Emmerson said Pakistan has also been "quite clear" on rejecting U.S. drone missions over its territory and that Islamabad believes the U.S. drone campaign "radicalizing a whole new generation, and thereby perpetuating the problem of terrorism in the region."U.S. officials rarely discuss the use of drones against terrorists, though they say privately civilian casualties are minimal.Imtiaz Gul says his researchers found the collateral damage is significant."Largely the pattern that emerged, in most of the cases, regardless of whether there was also a legitimate target present or not, a lot of innocent people, women and children also lost their lives," he said.Gul said his teams spoke to families of alleged victims and then would try to corroborate allegations with local officials and tribal elders.The findings on the impact of drone strikes in Pakistan will be part of a larger U.N. report on drones set to be presented later this year.U.N. spokesman Eduardo del Buey told reporters Friday the preliminary findings have not changed the position of U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon."Like any other weapon, the use of armed UAVs is subject to long standing rules of international law including international humanitarian law in situations of armed conflict," said del Buey. "He also believes there is a need for greater confidence in international community that the use of these weapons is within the bounds of international law."The U.N. investigators spoke to military and government officials as well as people in tribal areas.
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/11/17/two-americans-wanted-for-trying-to-ship-baby-body-parts-from-thailand/20994766/	Americans who produced 'Bumfights' videos wanted for shipping baby body parts from Thailand	Two American filmmakers previously vilified for promoting the "Bumfights" video series are wanted by Thai police on suspicion of trying to ship baby body parts to the U.S.Ryan (Ryen) McPherson and Daniel Tanner, both from California, fled Thailand Sunday after attempting to ship the packages to a Las Vegas production company owned by McPherson, police said during a press briefing, according to Coconuts Bangkok.Both men, in their early 30s, fled to Cambodia when multiple boxes filled with a baby's head and right foot, sheets of human skin and a human heart were found at a DHL facility outside the capital, police announced."Judging from how the body parts were preserved in formaldehyde and cut, this must have been done in a suitable facility," Asst. Prof. Udomsak Hoonwijit, head of Department of Forensic Medicine at Chulalongkorn University, told the website."As of now, we do not know which hospitals or education institutes they came from."The horrifying contents were packed into acrylic boxes and uncovered by X-rays, police said. The boxes were declared on customs forms as "toys.""X-rays showed there were contents similar to human body parts. From our investigation of three parcels we found human body parts in five plastic containers," Lieutenant General Ruangsak Jaritake, assistant to the national police commissioner, said, according to the Guardian.The foot was sliced into three sections and the heart had multiple stab wounds, police said, according to the Globe and Mail.McPherson told investigators he was given a ride aboard one of Bangkok's ubiquitous tuk-tuks (three-wheeled motorcycle) and taken to a night market where he bought them, according to the Bangkok Post.The filmmaker insisted he was sending them to people in the U.S. "just to spook them for fun," police said, according to the Straits Times, which also reported they cost a total of about $100.The body parts were stolen last month from a museum, according to one official, and that McPherson's explanation is "highly unlikely," but that both he and Johnson were released late Sunday night due to a lack of evidence."We can confirm that they were stolen from Siriraj," Udom Kachintorn, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, told reporters, according to the Globe and Mail.Both McPherson and Tanner visited that museum last month, Kachintorn added.The duo then promptly left the country for Cambodia. Thai authorities have since contacted the FBI for help tracking them down.McPherson, who also goes by Ryen, rose to infamy a decade ago on the backs of filmed fights pitting homeless men against each other for money.He settled multiple lawsuits by agreeing not to film and/or promote the divisive videos in the future.

Torrent Freak reports that Microsoft has already filed a complaint against persons behind an AT&T subscription who have activated multiple pirated copies of Windows 7 and Office 10.FROM EARLIER: This is Hollywood’s latest plan to fight piracyMicrosoft has a cyberforensics team in place that’s tracking such suspicious activities. In this case the team has identified “a number of product key activations from IP address 76.245.7.147, which is presently assigned to ISP AT&T Internet Services,” the complaint reads.These Windows 7 and Office 10 copies have been activated using suspicious keys that have apparently been “stolen from Microsoft’s supply chain, used without permission from the refurbisher channel, and used more often than the license permits,” as the publication points out.Earlier in October, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella addressed piracy, suggesting that the company doesn’t really mind if that’s how certain users get to experience Microsoft products. “Well, we’ve always had freemium. Sometimes our freemium was called piracy,” Nadella said. But the company apparently won’t tolerate pirates activating more than a decent number of illegal products at a time.Microsoft’s full complaint is available at the link in the source section below.More from BGR: Video: McDonald’s explains that its McNuggets are really made from chicken and contain no beaksThis article was originally published on BGR.com
http://news.yahoo.com/police-shoot-black-teen-missouri-gas-station-085737203.html	Police officer kills armed black man near Ferguson, Missouri	By Ian Simpson and Eric M. Johnson(Reuters) - A white policeman shot dead a black man brandishing a gun at a suburban St. Louis gasoline station overnight, police said on Wednesday, igniting violence reminiscent of riots over the police killing of an unarmed black teenager in nearby Ferguson.Black officials in Missouri were at pains to distinguish the death of a suspect they said had a gun from cases where unarmed black men were killed by police officers, incidents that led to protests across the United States and bitter debate about how American police forces treat non-white citizens.The shooting happened late on Tuesday at a Mobil On The Run gas station in Berkeley, Missouri, within walking distance of the Ferguson street on which a white police officer shot dead 18-year-old Michael Brown in August."This is not a policeman in the city of Berkeley going out half-cocked," Berkeley Mayor Theodore Hoskins said at a news conference. "You could not even compare this with Ferguson."A crowd of 200 to 300 people soon gathered at the site of the shooting, and bricks and three fireworks were thrown, two of them at the roughly 50 officers at the scene, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said.Two officers were injured and four people were arrested for assault before calm was restored, Belmar said.The shooting occurred three days after the worst fears of police-reform activists and the direst warnings of police leaders came to pass: on Saturday afternoon, a man summarily shot dead two officers in their patrol car in New York City, targeting them only because of the uniform they were wearing.The Berkeley encounter unfolded after the officer, a six-year veteran of the town's police department who was responding to a report of a theft, got out of his car to talk to two men at the gasoline station.One of them pointed a loaded 9mm handgun at the officer, Belmar said. Police released a somewhat indistinct, distant surveillance video from the gas station, edited to end just before the shooting.In the corner of the frame, one of the people at the station can be seen raising one or both arms in what may be a shooter's stance near the police car, although the footage is too dark and grainy to establish that the person is holding a gun. Two other videos released later by St. Louis County Police were similarly ambiguous, recorded by security cameras that appear to have only restricted views of the scene.Pulling out his own gun, the officer stepped backward, stumbled, and fired three shots, Belmar said, a sequence captured on one of the three videos. One bullet struck the man with the gun, a second hit a police car tire, and the third cannot be accounted for, he said.Paramedics declared the man dead at the gasoline station. Police said they found a handgun with a defaced serial number at the scene.SECOND MAN SOUGHTHoskins, Berkeley's mayor, said he did not want to jump to conclusions while local and county officials investigated the shooting, but he also emphasized what he said were clear differences with the Brown case."We have a majority of black officers in our city," Hoskins said, drawing contrasts with Ferguson. "The mayor is black. The city manager is black. The finance director is black. The police chief is black. Our police officers are more sensitive."Maria Chappelle-Nadal, a black Missouri state senator who has been tear-gassed while protesting Brown's death, said she believed the Berkeley police officer was justified."This is a different narrative in that he had a gun," she told CNN, referring to the man who was killed.Authorities did not identify the dead man, but the St. Louis Post-Dispatch named him as Antonio Martin, 18.The officer, who was not identified but has been put on administrative leave, had been given a body camera in a pilot program but was not wearing it at the time of the shooting. The dashboard camera on the officer's car was also off.Protests in Ferguson have taken place for months and spilled over into violence when a grand jury decided a month ago not to charge the police officer who shot Brown.Demonstrations in cities across the country gained in momentum when a New York grand jury decided not to indict a police officer over the death of Eric Garner, a 43-year-old black man who died in July when police tackled him and put him in a choke hold.Since the slaying on Saturday of the two New York police officers, police said on Wednesday that they had investigated about 40 threats of violence against officers and arrested four people. The gunman, described by Mayor Bill de Blasio as emotionally troubled, committed suicide after the shootings.(Reporting by Ian Simpson in Washington and Eric M.

http://www.businessinsider.com.au/one-of-the-worlds-biggest-cities-has-figured-how-to-virtually-eliminate-traffic-deaths-2015-7	One of the world's biggest cities has figured how to virtually eliminate traffic deaths	When most people think about Tokyo, they probably imagine glitzy neon lights and zero personal space. What they shouldn’t imagine, however, are traffic fatalities. Tokyo has practically none of them.According to a new report on city safety from the global research organisation World Resources Institute, traffic fatalities are near rock-bottom for Tokyoites. They occur at a rate of only 1.3 per 100,000 people.Fortaleza, Brazil, meanwhile, has 27.2 fatalities per 100,000 people.So what’s Tokyo’s secret?In conducting its research, WRI found that the safest cities all have several things in common. Generally speaking, traffic fatalities occur least often in compact cities — as opposed to sprawling ones — and they make plenty of accommodations for public transportation, biking and walking lanes, and clearly separate the spaces designed for cars and pedestrians.In Tokyo’s case, the city has managed to draw many of its citizens near public transportation, such as Shibuya Station. On a given workday, roughly 2.4 million people pass through the station, which is one of the nation’s largest. By comparison, Grand Central Terminal in NYC sees an average of 500,000 people daily.The largest station in Japan, Shinjuku Station, sees some 3.5 million per day. To accommodate the sheer volume of bodies, Tokyo relies on a mind-bogglingly complex railway system. The fact that individual rail lines look like a plate of spaghetti says more about the city’s use of organisation to serve its inhabitants than its lack there of.Noise issues aside, centralizing life around public transportation brings immediate benefits. For starters, it removes the need for cars in getting to work — a feat also accomplished by Tokyo’s many snaking bike lanes. But it also insulates the city’s culture, as much of its nightlife and shopping also happen near these stations.All this success in infrastructure is made even more impressive considering Japan’s motorists are only getting older.Japan is known for its longevity. But as Business Insider recently reported, the country is sitting on a “demographic time bomb.” People aren’t having kids, which is leading to an ageing cohort of drivers who presumably have poorer vision and slower reaction times.According to the latest figures, some 40% of the 172 traffic deaths in Tokyo in 2014 were among drivers 65 years and older, but the overall figure continues to decline.This is due in part to tightening safety restrictions on cars and the gradual improvement in urban planning — not to mention that for each person that takes the train, that marks one fewer person posing a threat on the roadways.Follow Business Insider Australia on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn
http://gizmodo.com/does-this-comment-describe-the-place-where-you-work-1724873579	Does This Comment Describe The Place Where You Work?	I asked you, the fine readers of Gizmodo, whether the cutthroat work environment attributed to Amazon was an outlier or old hat. One commenter’s description of their company seemed to widely resonate.Commenter clinteastwoodyallen wrote:Here is the thing, Bezos is a maniac who probably loves working far too much. His inner circle is like-minded. Couple that with his love of data porn and the result is an organization where an employee is only has good as her numbers. Me, my company is pretty mellow. Nobody is watching the clock. As long as your work is getting done nobody even cares if I put in a full 8 hour day. I can work from home as much as I want. Downside, not a lot of opportunities for advancement. Mgmt is incredibly insulated. I’ve seen my portion of the company profit sharing disappear, meanwhile on the sales side there a more and more nicer cars in the parking lot.“It’s almost as if we work in the same place,” replied jayjak. “I have pretty much the same experience. It was easier to jump to another group with better pay then get promoted in the one you start in,” said David the Omonomnomivore. “I feel like you described my company,” from Adamantiam.The comment felt familiar to me as well. I’ve worked in places with pretty chill expectations for workers—no one policing how you can decorate your desk or when you can take a break—yet paired with the casual environment was insular management and almost zero possibility for advancement. People would try to switch teams in order to gain responsibilities or a pay raise rather than get recognized by their current group. Ever-expanding, extravagant sales teams also seemed par for the course.This leads to the question of whether there’s a significant upside to a workplace that rigorously evaluates its workers. The conditions described at Amazon, of yearly culls and “social Darwinism” PR tactics, sound terrifying. Yet do these practices also lead to greater recognition and promotion of jobs well done? What happens to otherwise excellent places to work that makes management so unreachable and opportunities so scarce?Why does the situation clinteastwoodyallen outlines appear to evoke so many companies?
http://news.yahoo.com/al-qaeda-bursting-pain-over-pakistan-school-attack-112931366.html	Al-Qaeda 'bursting with pain' over Pakistan school attack	Al-Qaeda's regional branch on Sunday said its hearts were "bursting with pain" over the Taliban's massacre at a Pakistan school and urged the militants to target only security forces.The attack on Tuesday killed 149 people -- mostly children -- in the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar."Our hearts are bursting with pain and grief over this incident," Osama Mehmood, spokesman for Al-Qaeda South Asia chapter said in a four-page emailed statement."There is no doubt that the list of crimes and atrocities of the Pakistani army has crossed the limit and it is true that this army is ahead of everyone in America's slavery and genocide of Muslims... but it does not mean that we should seek revenge from oppressed Muslims," Mehmood said."The guns that we have taken up against Allah's enemy America and its pet rulers and slave army should not be aimed towards children, women and our Muslim people," he added.Al-Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri announced the creation of the new South Asia branch in September to "wage jihad" in Myanmar, Bangladesh and India.The Afghan Taliban, who are loosely affiliated with Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), have also condemned the attack, saying killing innocent children was against Islam.Pakistan described the bloody rampage as its own "mini 9/11", saying it was a game changer in its fight against terror.The army has been waging a major offensive against longstanding Taliban and other militant strongholds in the restive tribal areas on the Afghan border for the last six months.

http://www.forbes.com/sites/jurgenappelo/2015/08/18/why-amazon-and-google-fail/	Why Amazon And Google Fail	This week, the New York Times “revealed” that work-life for employees at Amazon is not one full of rainbows and unicorns. The article claimed that the organizational culture is so tough that employees frequently cry. Amazon’s CEO Jeff Bezos responded by saying that he doesn’t recognize the picture of his company painted in the article, and some Amazon employees have publicly denied the accusations and published a list of falsehoods they found in the New York Times article. A month earlier, a former Google employee made headlines in the news after she had reported on Twitter that transparency at this company–in this case, openness of salaries–is not always appreciated as much as the company claims. Laszlo Bock, author of Work Rules!, wrote that transparency is one of the key principles at the highly admired online search giant. However, in response to the salary debate, Google stated that the company does not discuss individual employees.I find that most news items in respectable magazines about the culture at successful companies look suspiciously similar to “news reports” about celebrities in tabloids. They offer us the daily practices of celebrities (“What All Famous Athletes Do Before Breakfast”), how successful the stars are (“The Top 10 Wealthiest Opera Singers”), how we can be more like them (“Three Superstars Reveal Their Secrets”) and, most importantly, how the celebrities are still human and fallible, just like the rest of us (“Breaking News: Top Actor Admits He Is An Actress”).Is all that tabloid material any different from articles such as “7 Things Successful Entrepreneurs Do Each Day,” “The Best HR Practices At Fortune 500 Companies,” or “Newsflash: Despite All Growth, Profits, and Biographies About Their CEOs, No Company Is Perfect?”The RotterdamBuilding “The Rotterdam” in Rotterdam.It is useful to consider that companies are a lot like cities.In the last two years, my hometown of Rotterdam (The Netherlands) was listed in several lists of “Top Cities in the World,” including one by the New York Times and one by Rough Guide. It made me feel proud. This means that journalists can now include Rotterdam in articles such as “The Three Good Practices Of Popular Cities” (my guess: architecture, transport, and excellent coffee), “The Best-Kept Secret Of Amazing Cities” (my answer: try not to get on any Top Cities list) and, of course, “How Great Cities Fall From Grace” (my suggestion: too many annoying tourists following the hype).Recommended by ForbesCompanies are like cities. Every business can be successful and amazing in different ways. But it’s impossible to be great in every dimension. One cannot be the world’s best movie director and the world’s fastest short-distance sprinter. A city does not have the world’s best museums and the world’s best beaches. Companies don’t have the most amazing perks for employees and the highest salaries and bonuses and the best leadership practices and the highest profits.For each thing that makes a company great, there are other things that make them less-than-great. It’s easy for journalists to take a look at a corporation from one angle only, paint a caricature of what they see, and then publish the results as if they offer “the secret side, the real story.” They do this with celebrities, with cities, and–unsurprisingly–also with companies.There are only three things we can learn from all these articles:    Company cultures are too complex to reduce to simplistic one-liners;    Great companies will fail in some areas, just like the rest of us;    We authors will try any titillating headline to get your attention.

http://news.yahoo.com/giuliani-michael-brown-death-never-gone-grand-jury-173800728.html	Giuliani: Michael Brown's Death Shouldn't Have Gone to a Grand Jury	After days of nation-wide protesting and rioting over the grand jury decision to not indict former Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani said on Sunday that prosecutors shouldn't have tried to indict him in front of a grand jury in the first place. Doing so, according to Giuliani, was political theater."I don't see how this case normally would even have been brought to a grand jury," said Giuliani, a former prosecutor, on Fox News Sunday. "This is the kind of case—had it not had the racial overtones and the national publicity—where a prosecutor would have come to the conclusion that there is not enough evidence to present to the grand jury.""Attorney General Holder’s gonna have to take a case in which a jury couldn't find probable cause to indict, and he's gonna have to try to find probable cause in front of a federal grand jury,” Giuliani said. "It's an impossible case to present to a grand jury.”Giuliani also doubled down on controversial comments he made last Sunday on NBC's Meet The Press, in which he said so-called black-on-black crime was "the reason for the heavy police presence in the black community" and suggesting that "the danger to a black child ... is another black." In a heated exchange with Michael Eric Dyson, a noted Georgetown University professor and civil rights activist, Giuliani said, "the white police officers won't be there if you weren't killing each other."When asked about a Pew Research Center survey which found that 70 percent of black Americans believe they are treated less fairly than whites in their experience with police, Giuliani ceded to Fox host Chris Wallace, "I do believe that there is more interaction and more unfair interaction between police officers, white and black."However, he insisted that reality is in the hands of the black community, saying, "I think just as much, if not more, responsibility is on the black community to reduce the reason why the police officers are assigned in such large numbers to the black community," He added: "It's because blacks commit murder eight times more per capita than any other group in our society.""If I'd put all my police on Park Avenue instead of Harlem, thousands more blacks would have died during my time in office," Giuliani said.This article was originally published at http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/11/rudy-giuliani-michael-brown-death-never-should-have-gone-to-a-grand-jury/383269/

Susi, who voiced the unseen Mrs. Debbie Wolowitz since the show's start in 2007, passed away at age 62 after a battle with cancer. At the end of The Big Bang Theory's recent episode, a card featuring Susi' headshot aired with this message: "In loving memory of Carol Ann Susi. 'Mrs. Wolowtiz.' Every time you spoke, we laughed.

Big Bang Theory executive producers Chuck Lorre, Steve Molaro and Bill Prady said in a joint statement, "Unseen by viewers, the Mrs. Wolowitz character became a bit of a mystery throughout the show's eight seasons. What was not a mystery, however, was Carol Ann's immense talent and comedic timing."
http://www.voanews.com/content/nigeria-confirms-5-new-ebola-cases/1972611.html	Ebola Toll Tops 900; Liberia Declares Emergency	The deadly Ebola outbreak on Wednesday showed new signs of spreading, as Nigeria confirmed a second death plus five new cases.The new cases in Nigeria raise concerns that the virus will spread further in Africa's most populous nation, with its 174 million residents. Meanwhile, Liberia has declared a state of emergency over the outbreak with its president saying the scale of the epidemic represented a threat to state security.So far, the smaller and less populous countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea have been the epicenters of the outbreak, which has claimed 932 deaths among more than 1,700 cases, the World Health Organization reported Wednesday. Saudi Arabia reported it was investigating the suspicious death of a man who traveled through West Africa.Ebola outbreaks, deaths in east Africa, as of August 6, 2014The World Health Organization will convene an ethics panel next week to discuss whether the experimental drug ZMapp should be given to some Ebola patients across West Africa.Two American medical missionaries who contracted the Ebola virus in Liberia appear to be showing signs of improvement after doses of the experimental serum in recent days.The drug has not been approved for, or tested on humans, and according to its manufacturer, there is only a very limited supply of the experimental drug.If its use is recommended, the panel then will consider who should get the drug. President Barack Obama said late Wednesday it was too early at this point to consider sending the drug to West Africa.Nigerian officials said a nurse who treated the country's first Ebola patient two weeks ago died Tuesday of the disease. She was the first known Nigerian to have died from Ebola. The other victim was Patrick Sawyer, a Liberian-American who flew into Nigeria from Liberia with the disease. He was hospitalized in Lagos and died July 25.A Nigerian port health official wears protective gear at Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos, Nigeria, Aug. 6, 2014.The five other Nigerian patients are now in isolation at a Lagos hospital. All are health workers who treated Sawyer.Nigeria is bracing for the possibility of more infections. Health Minister  Onyebuchi Chukwu said the government is establishing a 24-hour-a-day Ebola command center and is trying to prepare hospitals around the country in case the disease spreads further.“We need to work with each state government to establish isolation wards in readiness for any eventuality,” Chukwu said, noting the one in Lagos State would be strengthened and expanded.Ebola suspected in Saudi deathMeanwhile, Saudi Arabia's official news agency reported that a suspected Ebola patient died in Jeddah on Wednesday despite two days of intensive hospital treatment. The man came down with symptoms of Ebola after a business trip to Sierra Leone. Saudi health officials have sent tissue samples to laboratories abroad to confirm whether the deceased patient had been infected by Ebola.Liberia prays for reliefIn Liberia, where WHO has reported at least 282 deaths from the virus, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf’s message to the nation Tuesday night boiled down to this: God help us.“Relying on his divine guidance for our survival as a nation,” she said, “I call on all Liberians to observe three days of national fast and prayer to see God’s face, to have mercy on us and forgive our sins and heal our land.”Beginning Wednesday, Liberians are to fast and pray from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.Sirleaf’s pronouncement has gotten mixed reactions in the capital, Monrovia. Some say it shows just how desperate the situation has become while others tell VOA it is an important step to keep people calm and unified.Some had already heeded the president's call as of daylight Wednesday.About 700 people, some dressed in white, gathered here at the Abundant Life Church Church on the outskirts of Monrovia.“…The nation will survive.  Hallelujah.  Our country will emerge victorious over this incurable disease,” Pastor Varney Yarwo preached from the pulpit.‘The Dark Week’The Liberian health ministry said 94 people died of Ebola over seven days beginning July 27, in what its latest report calls "The Dark Week."Daily life has ground to halt in much of Liberia. Police are protecting health workers and facilities as fear and frustration continue to breed hostility. The president has put nonessential government workers on mandatory leave, closed schools and told citizens to avoid large public gatherings.That's all in the hope of reducing transmission of the disease, spread through bodily fluids, while health workers scramble to contain existing cases.In neighboring Sierra Leone, considered the most dangerous zone of this regional outbreak, soldiers have deployed to the east to quarantine the most affected areas.The government’s actions come amid reports that people there are not cooperating with efforts to isolate the sick and those who may have been exposed to the disease.This week, the World Bank pledged up to $200 million in emergency funding to help Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone contain the outbreak, improve public health systems and help communities cope with the economic impact of the crisis.American patients improvingTwo American missionaries who contracted Ebola in Liberia are said to be improving after receiving an experimental treatment. Nancy Writebol and Kent Brantly are in a hospital isolation unit in the U.S. city of Atlanta. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it is still too early to know whether the experimental drug, Zmapp, can save their lives.  The manufacturer of the drug, California-based Mapp Biopharmaceutical, said in a statement that very little of the drug is available but that the company is working with government agencies to increase production as quickly as possible.VOA contributors to this report include Anne Look from Dakar, Senegal, Heather Murdock from Abuja, Nigeria, and Prince Collins.

Movie Rights From Nintendo, Leaked Emails Show	The deal came to light in a series of leaked emails between Sony Chief Amy Pascal and producer Avi Arad. UPDATE: Arad has denied that the deal has closed. View this image › A promotional image from the video game New Super Mario Bros. U Nintendo Sony Pictures and Nintendo appear to have closed a deal for the animated feature film rights to the Super Mario Bros. video game franchise, according to a series of emails discovered in the massive trove of hacked Sony files recently leaked to the media. “I am the proud father of mario the animated film [sic],” producer Avi Arad told Sony Studio Chief Amy Pascal in an email dated Oct. 23, 2014, with the subject line “Mario.” Arad then forwarded Pascal separate images of him with Mario Bros. creator Shigeru Miyamoto and Nintendo CEO Satoru Iwata, the latter of which included the message, “Happy ceo, lets get together, it’s the mother load [sic].” Pascal forwarded that email to Tom Rothman, who heads up Sony Pictures subsidiary TriStar Pictures. “Avi closed Mario brothers,” she said. “Animated.” Shigeru Miyamoto Felix Ordonez / Reuters Avi Arad Neil Hall / Reuters   The deal represents only the first step in a very long road to a green light for an actual feature film. Animated films especially go through a long and rigorous script development process before a movie starts production. The emails also did not indicate any filmmakers attached to the project, although Pascal does at one point suggest Genndy Tartakovsky, who directed the 2012 Sony Pictures Animation feature Hotel Transylvania and created the Cartoon Network series Dexter’s Laboratory, Samurai Jack, and Star Wars: Clone Wars. “[I]ts soooo perfect for him,” Pascal wrote. (A rep for Tartakovsky tells BuzzFeed News, however, that the filmmaker “is not involved.”) On Oct. 24, Arad sent an email to Sony Pictures Animation President of Production Michelle Raimo Kouyate thanking her for a congratulatory basket she sent him filled with Mario Bros. merchandise. “Thank you Avi!” Kouyate responded. “Let’s build a Mario empire!” Kouyate also sent a photo of the basket to Pascal, and said, “I can think of 3-4 movies right out of the gate on this. So huge!” View this image › John Leguizamo and Bob Hoskins in 1993’s Super Mario Bros. Walt Disney Home Video / Via gigagamers.com Curiously, BuzzFeed News could not find any emails in which anyone at Sony Pictures expressed concern about any conflicts with their video game corporate cousin Sony Computer Entertainment, which is a direct competitor with Nintendo. But Mario Bros. is a property that Arad apparently had been chasing for some time: In a Feb. 24 email, Kouyate indicated to Pascal that Arad was traveling to Japan in part “to meet with his Nintendo guy (who he has been courting for a couple years).” Then on July 14, Arad sent the following email to Pascal: “I am heading to Tokyo … I am going to try and bring back a little plumber. I guess we can all use our pipes cleaned.” Nintendo has famously kept its video game properties away from movie adaptations after the disastrous 1993 live-action film Super Mario Bros. starring Bob Hoskins as Mario and John Leguizamo as his brother Luigi. In 2013, BuzzFeed News asked Mario Bros. creator Miyamoto if Nintendo had any interest in working with Hollywood again. “There have been a lot of cases where we’ve been approached by different people with lots of different ideas,” he said. “And I don’t want to say that it’s impossible, [but] I don’t want you to get the impression that we are in the middle of making a movie or something. … But we always have to take into account the fact that game entertainment and movie entertainment is quite different — one being passive, and one being active. Those don’t always necessarily mix.” Reps for Sony and Nintendo did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Rachel Zarrell contributed to this report. update After publication, Arad denied to BuzzFeed News via email that the Super Mario deal had closed, saying his negotiations with Nintendo were “just the beginning.”

http://www.aol.com/article/2014/11/13/report-planes-used-to-gather-cellphone-data/20993526/	Report: Planes used to gather cellphone data	WASHINGTON (AP) - The Justice Department is collecting data from thousands of cellphones through high-tech gear deployed on airplanes that mimics communications towers, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.The newspaper said the hunt for information about criminal suspects is also collecting data from many innocent Americans.Citing sources familiar with the operations, the newspaper said the U.S. Marshal's Service program, which became fully operational in 2007, operates Cessna aircraft from at least five metropolitan-area airports to collect the data. The airports were not identified in the Journal story.The planes are equipped with devices that mimic cell towers of large telecommunications firms and trick cellphones into reporting unique registration information. The 2-foot-square devices allow investigators to collect data from thousands of cellphones in a single flight, the Journal reported. The devices collect their identifying information and general location.The Justice Department would neither confirm nor deny the existence of such a program to the Journal. An official told the newspaper that discussion of such matters would allow criminal suspects of foreign powers to determine U.S. surveillance capabilities, adding that Justice Department agencies comply with federal law, including by seeking court approval.Calling it "a dragnet surveillance program," Christopher Soghoian, chief technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union, said: "It's inexcusable and it's likely - to the extent judges are authorizing it - they have no idea of the scale of it."The device being used by the Marshals Service identifies itself as having the closest, strongest signal - though it doesn't - and causes all the cellphones that can detect its signal to send in their unique registration information. Cellphones are programmed to connect automatically to the strongest cell tower signal.Phone companies are cut out in the search for suspects. Law enforcement has found that asking a company for cell-tower information to help locate a suspect can be slow and inaccurate. This program allows the government to get that information itself.People familiar with the program told the Journal they do get court orders to search for phones, but it isn't clear whether those orders describe the methods used because the orders are sealed.More from AOL.com: New terrorist alliance poses major problem Survivalist Eric Frein hit with 2 terror charges Key Obamacare architect caught insulting voters
http://www.voanews.com/content/volcano-erupts-in-japan-injuries-reported/2464521.html	31 Bodies Found Near Peak of Japan Volcano	Police in central Japan say they have found bodies of 31 hikers near the summit of Mount Ontake, a volcano that erupted without warning on Saturday, spewing ash, rocks and steam.Officials confirmed four deaths while 27 others were described as being in a state of "cardiac arrest," a term Japanese authorities often use to describe the dead until doctors can examine the body.More than 550 Japanese police, firefighters and military troops ascended the slopes of 3,067-meter (10,121-foot) Mount Ontake Sunday, searching for survivors and casualties from the eruption.Rescue workers endangeredHowever, rescue efforts were called off mid-afternoon Sunday because toxic volcanic gases were building and it was becoming too dangerous for emergency workers, an official at the Nagano prefectural government told the French news agency AFP."The rescue team suspended their operation because of the increasing concentration of sulphurous gas in the area," the official said.A suffocating blanket of ash up to 20 centimetres (eight inches) deep covered a large area of the volcano, and had forced up to 150 to seek refuge in mountaintop shelters at one point.Local officials believe 45 to 49 people sheltered overnight in cabins on the mountain, although details remained unclear. NHK News, Japan’s national broadcaster, reported the stranded hikers were expected to try descending Sunday.Popular autumn spotThe mountain is popular among walkers, particularly in late September when the turning of the autumn leaves makes for dramatic scenery.Officials said one person was rescued from under a thick layer of ash, and other hikers were seriously injured.However, AFP and The Associated Press reported that emergency helicopters rescued seven people, including two who were able to wave at a Self Defense Force helicopter.Some were unable to descend on their own, or unwilling to take the risk, AP reported.The volcano, which sits on the border of Nagano and Gifu prefectures west of Tokyo, had its last major eruption in 1979.“It was like thunder,” a woman told public broadcaster NHK of the first eruption at the volcano in seven years. “I heard boom, boom, then everything went dark.”Hikers who descended from the volcano reported scenes of horror, with stones raining down and hot ashes filling the air, AFP reported.Video footage shot inside a cabin, taken shortly after the eruption and shown on NHK, revealed the screams of terrified hikers as rocks thundered against the roof and walls.Flights delayedTokyo's Haneda airport said incoming domestic flights were experiencing delays of about 40 to 50 minutes because they were forced to change routes. International flights to and from Haneda were not affected by the eruption, the airport said.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who returned from the United States on Saturday, said he had ordered the military to help in rescue efforts.“I instructed to do all we can to rescue the people affected and secure the safety of the trekkers,” Abe told reporters.Kiso Prefectural Hospital, near the mountain, said it had dispatched a medical emergency team.“We expect a lot of injured people so we are now getting ready for their arrival,” said an official at the hospital.Mari Tezuka, who works at a mountain hut for trekkers, told Reuters: “It's all white outside, looks like it has snowed. There is very bad visibility and we can't see the top of the mountain.“All we can do now is shut up the hut and then we are planning on coming down... This is a busy season because of the changing autumn leaves. It's one of our busiest seasons," Tezuka said.The Japan Meteorological Agency warned people to stay away from the mountain, saying hot debris could fall within a four-kilometer radius.Some material for this report came from Reuters, AP and AFP.
http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2014/11/12/7202561/nba-birthplace-map-washington-dc-mississippi	This map shows which states produce the most NBA players	We analyze birthplace data to determine why so many NBA players come from Washington, D.C. and Mississippi.As a part of my NBA preview feature focused on maps that explain the league, I looked at the birthplaces of American players. I found that if you looked both at prior generations of players and current players, you found a simple pattern: large cities produce most of the league's players. For example, here's the heatmap that shows birthplaces of the NBA players born since 1980.The strongest producers aren't much of a surprise: New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia, with nods to Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, Indianapolis, Detroit, New Orleans, the Bay Area and Seattle. These are the major population centers of the nation, so it's expected to see most players come from those areas.But I wanted to find out if some areas produce NBA players at a higher rate than expected historically. So I adjusted for population and produced this map based on all-time NBA player counts. (Note that a Hall-of-Famer counts the same as a 10-day call-up in this map. There's no weighting for games played or quality of the player. Just raw numbers of players born in a state or territory.)As it turns out, Washington D.C. has an extraordinary record of producing NBA players. With 68 current and former players born in Washington, the District's rate per million of current resident is around 125. That's five times higher than the nearest state. It's so high that it's eyebrow-raising, in fact. Here are some potential explanations.* Washington is only urban, and we discovered from our previous maps that cities tend to produce most NBA players. Therefore, while other states have rural populations less likely to produce NBA players that in theory drag down their per-capita rates, D.C. does not.basketball is a game deeply embedded in certain diverse populations.* These maps rely on birthplaces only. (Thank you as always to basketball-reference.com for the data.) Perhaps an outsized number of suburban Maryland and Virginia children are born in D.C. such that the District's birth rate is abnormally high given its population. As it turns out, D.C.'s birth rate is among the highest in the nation, but not abnormally so.* Washington is overwhelmingly black. The NBA is overwhelmingly black. This seems like the most simple explanation, and it's backed up when you see what state follows D.C. on the list: Mississippi. D.C.'s population is 50 percent black. Mississippi leads the 50 states with a 37 percent black population. The U.S. Virgin Islands, which has produced three NBA players despite a tiny current population of 100,000 and follows Mississippi closely in per-capita NBA player production, is 76 percent black.Here's a U.S. census map from 2000 showing percentage of black population in each U.S. county.It doesn't match up with our per-capita NBA birthplace map perfectly. But the broad strokes are pretty close in the Deep South and along the eastern seaboard.What stands out are Indiana and Kentucky. Those two states have reputations as basketball wonderlands but middle-of-the-pack black populations. That suggests that local culture plays a major role in basketball player development. And in fact, that cultural argument reinforces the correlation between black populations and higher rates of NBA player production we see in D.C., Mississippi and the U.S. Virgin Islands: basketball is a game deeply embedded in certain diverse populations. It builds strongly local cultures, and that ultimately leads to success.Some other notes on this subject:* One of the pitfalls here is that we're using data on NBA player birthplaces collected since the late 1920s, but only accounting for current population. Obviously, population has shifted dramatically over 90 years. That means that the American West may be underrated on our map since it didn't have high levels of population for most of the NBA's life. We'll see if Arizona and Nevada, for example, starts producing more NBA players.* Vermont is the only U.S. state to never produce an NBA player. Neither Guam nor the Northern Mariana Islands have done so either.* Alaska can only claim one NBA player who was born there, Mario Chalmers. Carlos Boozer was born in Germany and Trajan Langdon was born in California. Such is the limit of using birthplace data. High school data might be more representative if so many players didn't attend prep academies in Virginia, Connecticut and Florida.* In raw numbers, California (the most populous state) leads the way with 352. New York follows with 310.* No, I'm not sure how Montana has produced nine NBA players either. It has the smallest black population in the nation (4,000 black residents for 0.67 percent of the population as of the 2010 census) and no major basketball culture as far as anyone outside Montana can tell. (For the record, all nine of the NBA players born in Montana are white. Phil Jackson is the only one in the Hall of Fame.)* The three players born in the U.S. Virgin Islands: Tim Duncan (of course), Raja Bell and Charles Claxton, who played seven minutes for the Celtics in 1996.★★★

Vongfong was previously the strongest storm of 2014.The eye of the Category-5 storm is expected to stay offshore, but islands that are part of the capital city Tokyo may be in the path of the monster storm, according to AccuWeather.The Izu and Ogasawara Islands, well south of the mega city but administratively part of it, are expected to be hit Thursday or Friday, but the storm is expected to significantly weaken by then.Nuri's current path has it aimed squarely at the southern island Okinawa, where multiple U.S. military bases are located.The Joint Typhoon Warning Center still has Japan within the "cone of uncertainty" normally used to depict the expected path a storm will take, but it is expected to be a near-miss.Nuri is forceast to take a turn towards the northeast that will bring the powerful system just east of Tokyo.The Super Typhoon is already as strong or stronger than Vongfong, which had previously been the strongest storm of the year.Satellite data shows Nuri's sustained winds have stayed at or above 180 mph for more than 12 hours. Those winds are expected to top 195 mph before the storm begins to weaken."Super Typhoon" status is achieved once a storm's sustained winds top 150 mph. Nuri is the sixth such storm this season.Stunning footage from the International Space Station shows how big the storm is, and offers a rare top-down view.Nuri began on Halloween as a tropical depression and rapidly intensified over the weekend. It is expected to eventually slam Alaska's Aleutian Islands, in the Bering Sea, as a strong non-tropical storm.Both Nuri and Vongfong have narrowly missed hitting the Philippines. The island nation was devastated in 2013 by Super Typhoon Haiyan, which came ashore with 190 mph winds and a storm surge that wiped out the city of Tacloban.
http://nypost.com/2015/08/20/terry-collins-blunt-message-for-returning-david-wright/	Terry Collins' blunt message for returning David Wright	BALTIMORE — David Wright will be the Mets’ primary occupant at third base, but he won’t own the position.The Mets captain, who is days away from rejoining the club after months of rehabbing from spinal stenosis, was told by manager Terry Collins to temper his expectations.“[Wright] won’t be that everyday guy until we know his back is 100 percent and that might not be until next spring,” Collins said before the Mets’ 5-4 loss to the Orioles on Wednesday. “So we’ll have to keep an eye on it.”An already crowded infield will become overstuffed upon Wright’s expected return Monday in Philadelphia, and Collins will try to find a formula for playing time.Daniel Murphy will be the primary second baseman, but still could see action at third. That leaves Wilmer Flores and Ruben Tejada vying for playing time at shortstop, with Juan Uribe and utilityman Kelly Johnson also in the mix.“That is what happens when you get a lot of players that are pretty good,” Collins said. “You’ve got to figure out how to get them all in the game at different times. Yeah, it will be a little bit of a challenge.”But the challenge will be welcomed, given that Wright has missed the past four months, first with a pulled hamstring and later with back soreness that was diagnosed as spinal stenosis. In his absence, the infield has played musical chairs, including the additions of Uribe and Johnson before the trade deadline.“It’s unfortunate David got hurt,” Murphy said. “But I feel like the ballclub, we were able to pick up the slack and it will be really nice to get our best player back.”Murphy stills views Wright in those terms.“Look at the back of his baseball card,” Murphy said.Murphy called it “exciting” that Wright is on the verge of returning.“It’s big for me,” Murphy said. “It’s going to be really nice to see all the work he’s put in.”Does Murphy feel more comfortable with Flores and Tejada after watching them make strides in Wright’s absence?“I always knew they were good players,” Murphy said. “I just think that with the consistent at-bats they were able to show what good players they are.”
http://www.examiner.com/article/wwe-news-randy-orton-makes-face-turn-on-monday-night-raw	WWE news: Randy Orton makes face turn on Monday Night Raw	Play WWE 2K15 trailer. http://www.ClassicGameRoom.com Shop CGR t-shirts & mugs! http://www.CGRstore.com Classic Game Room's CGR Trailers presents a Randy Orton entrance video for WWE 2K15 Yukes, Visual Concepts and 2K Sports. The release date is scheduled... on.aol.comAccording to an Oct. 13 report from Wrestlezone, WWE star Randy Orton made a face turn on this week's episode of Monday Night Raw. Orton, 34, turned face by confronting Seth Rollins, one of the top heel characters in the WWE.Orton, 34, has been a babyface before in his WWE career, but he's coming off a lengthy stint as a heel. He most recently was part of the villainous WWE Authority, which was comprised of WWE head honcho Stephanie McMahon, Triple H, Kane and Rollins.How did the face turn go down? It wasn't quite as shocking as Rollins' heel turn earlier this year, but it did the trick to draw a pop from the crowd on hand and the millions more watching at home. During this week's episode of WWE Monday Night Raw, Orton walked out to the cage during Rollins' match with Jack Swagger.After Rollins pinned Swagger, Orton hopped in the cage and yelled at the former Shield star. Orton's face turn generated a huge applause from the crowd on hand in Atlanta, and it sets him up for a possible match against Rollins at this month's Hell in a Cell pay-per-view. Additionally, Orton's face turn was the talk of the social media world, in the minutes after it happened.Is Orton's face turn a good thing for the company? Absolutely. The WWE desperately needed to balance out their heel to babyface ratio, since Daniel Bryan and Roman Reigns recently went down with injuries. With two of their top babyface characters sidelined with debilitating injuries, the time was right to turn Orton face.Also, Orton's character had grown a bit stale in recent months. It became clear change was needed. With Orton now a babyface character, the possibilities are endless for him. The WWE could match him up to battle Rusev, The Miz or any number of possible contenders. Here's the thing: Next up for Orton is a slot at Hell in a Cell, where he'll battle the loser of John Cena's clash with Dean Ambrose.
http://www.examiner.com/article/charles-krauthammer-obama-seething-may-try-to-provoke-impeachment	Charles Krauthammer: Obama 'seething,' may try to provoke impeachment	Play Charles Krauthammer warned that President Obama will seek revenge after big Republican wins in midterm elections, and will do something "reckless." FoxNews/YouTube VideoIn an appearance on The O'Reilly Factor on Fox News Wednesday night, psychiatrist and Fox News contributor Charles Krauthammer told Bill O'Reilly that President Barack Obama is "seething" over the sweeping GOP victories in Tuesday's midterm elections, and may do something "reckless" in response. Krauthammer, who is widely respected in conservative circles, is also a Pulitzer Prize winner, a columnist for the Washington Post, and a contributing editor to the Weekly Standard.Krauthammer referred to President Obama's defiant press conference after the elections. In rejecting the voters obvious discontent with Obama and the Democrat Party, the president vowed to move forward with an 'executive action' that could grant amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants, and also promised to move forward with his progressive agenda."The principles that we’re fighting for, the things that motivate me every single day and motivate my staff every day … those things aren't going to change," the president said.Bill O'Reilly suggested at one point during the interview that Obama wants to "go out guns blazing," and Krauthammer wholeheartedly agreed, and also indicated he believes Obama is in denial over the election results."You’re absolutely right," Krauthammer responded. "He’s a strange combination of obliviousness and recklessness. It’s as if he doesn't know what happened." Krauthammer then warned, the president is “going to sort of get his revenge on everybody by doing a reckless thing which is to legalize millions of illegal aliens, I would say, unconstitutionally, in a way that he knows is going to create a crisis.”Krauthammer said by provoking the GOP into starting impeachment proceedings Obama would hope to create backlash against Republicans, and put himself "back in the limelight … in the spotlight."But Krauthammer also cautioned such a move by the Republicans would not be a good idea. "We’re talking about him," Krauthammer said. "That’s what he wants.""This is time for Republicans to be very disciplined. They won the election because they were disciplined. They stayed on message. They made it a referendum on Obama, and they won," he continued. "What they have to do now is to go from being the party of no to the party with an agenda."

http://tv.yahoo.com/news/actor-jeff-daniels-laughs-last-dumb-dumber-180502645.html	Actor Jeff Daniels laughs last with 'Dumb and Dumber To'	By Eric KelseyLOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Jeff Daniels' phone rang, and his agents were on the line."It was an intervention," said the actor, who had a reputation for serious roles in successful films, of the failed attempt two decades ago to prevent him from doing low-brow comedy "Dumb and Dumber" with two rookie directors."We're going to stop this. You're not going to do this movie, and we're going to keep you on the Oscar trail," Daniels, 59, remembered his agents saying. They could not foresee that his role as the dimwitted, unemployed dog groomer Harry would become one of his most well-known characters and box office successes.Daniels reprises that role, reputation intact, in "Dumb and Dumber To" - with a misspelled number - alongside Jim Carrey, whose performance as Harry's equally dense and foolish best friend Lloyd Christmas established the comedian as one of Hollywood's leading stars.View gallery Actor Jeff Daniels poses at the world premiere of the film "Dumb and Dumber To" in Los Ang …The gross-out adventure comedy from brothers Bobby and Peter Farrelly will debut in U.S. theaters on Friday and begins with Harry, 20 years older but just as stupid, needing a kidney transplant but unable to find a donor match.That is until he learns about an unknown daughter he fathered who was put up for adoption. He and Lloyd set out on a road trip to find her but become unwittingly ensnared in a murder plot."Find your kid, find your kidney!" Lloyd exclaims to a puzzled Harry.Their trip unfolds with typical harebrained hijinks, including crossing the country in a borrowed hearse and a stolen Zamboni ice resurfacer.Although the first "Dumb and Dumber" grossed $247 million worldwide and became a mainstay on U.S. cable TV, Daniels admits his agents were correct that starring in a doofus comedy replete with scatological humor could set him back in Hollywood.View gallery Actors Jim Carrey (L) and Jeff Daniels arrive in a van decorated as a dog at the world premiere of t …"I think easily for 10 years - and because of the success of 'Dumb and Dumber' - I was no longer taken seriously," he said.Daniels, who earned Golden Globe acting nominations for "The Purple Rose of Cairo" (1985) and "Something Wild" (1986) did not score another top-tier Hollywood award nomination until 2005's "The Squid and the Whale.""As soon as you do comedy, then you're not serious anymore, which has always bothered me because the last time you looked, the Greeks are holding up two masks - and to be able to do both seems to be the point of being an actor," Daniels added.Two decades on, Daniels has earned enough showbiz gravitas to afford pulling off a "Dumb and Dumber" sequel while still getting to show off his dramatic chops on Aaron Sorkin's HBO series "The Newsroom," picking up an Emmy award for best TV drama actor along the way as well."I love changing it up," Daniels said. "I love going from 'Newsroom' to 'Dumb and Dumber.' I like that range.

There are large, well-trained and well-equipped air forces that are obvious candidates for such a list. Then there are less-obvious candidates—like Russia. The Russian Air Force, while plane-for-plane older than many air forces, has numbers, the ubiquity of the largest country by size on Earth, a modernization plan and nuclear weapons. It cannot be ignored, and thanks to Putin and his repeated sorties near NATO and Japanese air space, it certainly won’t be. China is in many ways similar.After that, however, the road gets murky. Vulnerabilities become apparent. There are air forces that are well equipped and trained, but for budgetary reasons, are too small to adequately fulfill national roles and requirements (think all of Europe.) There are also air forces that are magnificently equipped, but poorly trained. (Think virtually all of the Middle East.)For the purpose of this article, we’ll judge air forces by the following criteria: size, influence and doing the best job of matching capabilities to the mission.United StatesThe U.S. Air ForceThe preeminent air arm of the United States, the U.S. Air Force (USAF), is the primary service responsible for air and space missions. It manages everything from intercontinental ballistic missiles to X-37 space planes to A-10 Thunderbolt tank killers. It coordinates military space launches, airdrops of Army paratroopers and drops bombs on ISIS insurgents.(Recommended: The U.S. Army's 5 Most Lethal Weapons of War) The USAF operates 5,600 aircraft of all types, including F-22 Raptors, F-35, F-15 and F-16 fighters. It operates B-2, B-1 and B-52 strategic bombers, as well as C-5, C-17 and C-130 airlifters. It operates these aircraft from bases in the continental United States and overseas bases from the United Kingdom to Japan.The Air Force has roughly 312,000 active-duty members, coming in just behind the People’s Liberation Army Air Force, and yet it operates more planes than the PLAAF.The USAF was the first air force worldwide to fly stealth combat aircraft, the first to fly fifth-generation fighters, and the first to commit to an all-stealth combat aircraft force. The USAF plans on preserving its edge by purchasing 1,763 F-35s and up to 100 optionally manned Long-Range Strike Bombers. Unmanned aerial vehicles, increasingly with stealthy profiles and attack capabilities, will gradually represent a larger proportion of the overall aircraft fleet.(Recommended: Russia's Deadly Su-35 Fighter)The USAF also manages two legs of the U.S. nuclear triad, including 450 intercontinental ballistic missiles and the strategic bomber force.The U.S. Navy and Marine CorpsWorthy of separate mention due to their size and capabilities, the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps are combined the world’s second-largest air force, with a total of over 3,700 aircraft of all types. This includes 1,159 fighters, 133 attack aircraft, 172 patrol aircraft, 247 transports and 1,231 helicopters.The aircraft of the U.S. Navy are responsible for protecting the U.S. fleet and conducting air missions from and often over the world’s oceans and seas. Most of the aircraft of the Navy and Marine Corps operate from ships at sea, a difficult and dangerous job that requires a high level of training and proficiency.(Recommended: The Russian Air Force's Secret Weapon) The most visible aspect of U.S. naval aviation are the carrier air wings that fly off eleven nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. Each wing typically consists of around sixty aircraft divided into three squadrons of F/A-18 Hornets and Super Hornets, one E-2C Hawkeye airborne early-warning squadron, one EA-18G Growler electronic warfare squadron, and one helicopter squadron.Other aspects of naval aviation include the helicopters that fly off U.S. Navy cruisers, destroyers and other surface ships, P-3 Orion and P-8 Poseidon maritime control aircraft, and variants of the P-3 that conduct electronic surveillance missions. US navy aviation also contributes to the U.S. strategic nuclear force, flying TACAMO (Take Charge And Move Out) aircraft whose mission is to provide command and control in the event of a nuclear war.U.S. Marine Corps aircraft are counted under the Navy total and serve on Navy ships, but are oriented towards Marine combined air-ground operations, with an emphasis on supporting marine ground forces.(Recommended: 5 Chinese Weapons of War America Should Fear) RussiaThe dissolution of the Soviet Union left the bulk of Soviet air power in the hands of the new Russian state, and Russia has coasted on this prodigious inheritance for decades.Pages
https://www.yahoo.com/movies/interstellar-ending-explained-102298382597.html	Interstellar': A Physicist Explains That Crazy Ending	If you think the ending of Interstellar was confusing, try understanding the science — or lack thereof — behind it.Christopher Nolan’s sci-fi epic, which had a strong opening weekend, touted the accuracy of the basic physics behind its story. Renowned theoretical physicist Kip Thorne consulted closely with the director and his screenwriter brother Jonathan Nolan, advising them on how they might use wormholes, black holes, and other spacetime phenomena to send astronauts (played by Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway) to far ends of the galaxy.The end of the film, however, veers away from proven science into the realm of the very speculative. McConaughey’s character, Cooper, ends up in a massive black hole, which holds a gigantic bookshelf that allows him to communicate, via Morse Code, with a past version of his daughter, Murph. It’s pretty wild, and a bit mind boggling for us non-scientists, so Yahoo Movies got in touch with Thorne’s colleague at Caltech, Dr. Sean Carroll, to discuss the science behind the end of the film. How much of the film was based on valid, solid science — and what went beyond the science we have today? The ideas of time dilation and visiting the vicinity of the black hole, and how that would sort of send you into the future, and the actual appearance of the black hole and of the wormhole — this was all very respectable, good science. The wormhole itself, the idea that there is a wormhole connecting our galaxy to another galaxy, is more speculative. It’s plausible, it’s something that is not ruled out by strong evidence that we have right now.And then the stuff at the end, where they actually go inside a black hole and use some tesseract to visit and influence the past, and then somehow come out of the black hole once again was, I think, pretty far beyond anything we’d consider plausible science right now. But there’s enough we don’t know for sure that you can always say, Well, who knows?Related: 9 Modern Space Movies That Will Help Prepare You for 'Interstellar'Is there any science that could make the stuff at the end possible? I think that it was mostly magic. But I think that there were a few phrases thrown out, if I caught them correctly, that were supposed to indicate that this was not a naturally occurring phenomenon — that this was some set-up by a much more advanced species that lives in a higher dimensional spacetime, and has learned a lot about how to mess with the laws of nature.Remember, in the movie there was a brief discussion about how someone could really live in more dimensions, that they would see time as a place they could just visit, and go back and forth. I take it that what we’re supposed to imagine is that’s what happened. It’s not simply that Matthew McConaughey fell into a black hole. But that we’re being manipulated a little bit by a species that knows a lot more than we do, so they can do things that we just don’t know how to accomplish.Was there any science in the bookshelf? I think that’s just completely speculative. Clearly, if he was going to see anything at all, the only place that that book shelf and that tesseract comes from is his own imagination and that’s not something you and I would see falling through a black hole. I think that needs to be an artificially constructed thing. I think the big buy in the whole set-up is that not only are there some laws of physics that we don’t understand, which is certainly true, but that there is some hyper-advance species other than human beings that have learned to manipulate them and are helping our hero out a little bit here.So he’s in the black hole, sending Morse code to his daughter. Then he disappears and they find him again. How would one get out of a black hole, even speculatively? I think I do have an idea, but I don’t think it was very elaborated in the actual movie. So you need to have some behind-the-scenes information. Remember they were occasionally referring to extra-dimensions and bulk? That actually plays a hugely important role here that they never talked about explicitly. The idea here is that our world has three dimensions of space, and one dimension of time. So there’s four dimensions overall, and maybe our world is like the edge of some world that is one higher dimension.So there could be a world that has four dimensions of space and one dimension of time, and we’re at the boundary of it. And this five-dimensional universe is what is called by physicists the "bulk spacetime." And if that’s true, which it may or may not be, then there’s not only wormholes, but there’s another kind of shortcut outside of our ordinary spacetime. I think the idea would be — and again this is speculative — but not absolutely impossible. If you’re stuck in our four-dimensional space time, you can’t get out of a black hole, or the event horizon. But you can sort of sneak out into the extra dimension and then back, if that’s what you have the ability to do.But I take it that our hero, Cooper, was basically rescued after being treated by some higher dimensional being with the ability to influence the past through the tesseract. That he was also rescued by them by being pulled out of our ordinary four-dimensional universe into a fifth dimension, and then placed back somehow.Anne Hathaway gives a speech about love being scientific. What did you think about that as a scientist? I think that was too bad. No scientist would actually say that. It’s not false, but it’s not what a scientist would say, because scientists have great respect for the meaning of the words that they use. And if you want to say that love is a force, there is a definition of the word "force" under which that’s true, but it’s not any definition that any physicist would use. So it’s a little bit of a poetic license that most scientists would indulge in.

(AP) — An 11-year-old Mexican boy suffering from a massive tumor, who drew international attention after U.S. Homeland Security Investigations helped him get treatment in New Mexico, is scheduled to have a series of surgeries in Albuquerque to remove the large growth on his shoulder.The boy will have his first operation later this month at the University of New Mexico Hospital in what is expected to be a long road to recovery, said Kristean Alcocer, the Spanish ministry coordinator at the First Baptist Church of Rio Rancho."We are very, very excited," Alcocer said. "We've been waiting for this for two years now and it's finally going to happen."In July 2012, U.S. Homeland Security Investigations helped in picking up the boy and his parents from a neighborhood in Ciudad Juarez — a city plagued by drug cartel violence.Federal agents helped the family seek care for the boy, known as Jose, after First Baptist Church members saw him during a missionary visit.Federal officials wanted to keep the boy's identity secret because his family still lives in Ciudad Juarez.View gallery FILE - In this July 20, 2012, file photo, the father of a Juarez-born boy suffering from massive tum …The boy was diagnosed with venous lymphangioma on his shoulder and told by doctors at the University of New Mexico Hospital that he must undergo a series of surgeries and treatments to remove the huge fluid buildup.For the past two years the church has raised money for the boy, who is now living in Rio Rancho, Alcocer said.Jose's plight drew support from New Mexico Gov.

http://www.voanews.com/content/ukraine-russia-extend-gas-deal-talks-after-impasse/2501701.html	Russia, Ukraine Reach Temporary Gas Deal	Russia, locked in a bitter standoff with Ukraine over a pro-Russian rebellion in Ukraine's east, has agreed to resume natural gas deliveries to its neighbor, in a deal brokered by the European Commission.The agreement, announced Thursday in Brussels, blunts the threat of severe gas shortages in energy-dependent Ukraine as the predictably harsh Eurasian winter approaches.  The deal, which requires Kyiv to make monthly payments in advance of delivery, is set to expire in March 2015.  Ukrainian Energy Minister Yuri Prodan told reporters the agreement allows his country to purchase gas at $378 per 1,000 cubic meters until the end of the year, while paying $365 between January and March of next year.Russia cut off gas supplies in June over what it said were Kyiv's payment arrears of about $5 billion.  The debt has since been reduced to $3.1 billion, which officials say will be paid in two installments by the end of the year.Moscow had demanded prepayment to restart winter gas supplies, while Kyiv has said it was seeking to raise more money internationally to pay the arrears.The European Commission is considering Ukraine's recent request for a new EU loan of about $2.5 billion.Russia's natural gas giant Gazprom stopped supplies to Ukraine in 2006 and 2009 over pricing disputes, leaving homes and businesses in parts of central and eastern Europe without heat.  Both cutoffs, resolved within weeks, forced industrial consumers to ration supplies.
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/congress-cut-pension-205230762.html	Is Congress About to Cut Your Pension?	Congress is set to vote on a $1.1 trillion spending bill this week, one with a troubling provision for U.S. retirees. If the bill passes, the promised retirement benefits of millions of workers could be slashed. The knee-jerk reaction: Fear that it could set a dangerous precedent and lead to more widespread cuts in retiree pension benefits. Is that realistic? Here’s what it really boils down to.Is my pension going away?Maybe not right now. But a provision in a $1.1 trillion spending bill that Congress may pass this week could set a scary precedent. It would allow the promised pension benefits of up to 1.5 million workers and retirees to be cut. It would affect the pooled pension plans — called multiemployer plans — of mostly union workers across a bunch of companies, where it looks like the plans won’t be able to cover full benefits in coming decades.Does this mean private pensions are in danger, too — the relative few that still exist?The 31 million people in so-called single employer plans wouldn’t be affected by the bill. The bigger fear is about the 10 million workers and retirees in pooled plans.Ten to 15 percent of those workers are in plans that may need to make cuts.How painful will the cuts be?A retiree with a pension of $24,000 per year and 25 years of service could see his or her annual benefit cut in half, according to the Pension Rights Center. Not all the troubled pensions would need to cut that deeply.Is anyone safe from the cuts?Retirees age 75 and older would be protected from some benefit cuts, and so would disabled retirees.How many people still have pension plans, anyway?In the last 15 years, the portion of the U.S.’s largest companies offering defined-benefit pensions to new workers has fallen from 60 percent to 24 percent, estimates Towers Watson. Private companies have been cutting pension benefits by freezing new workers out of plans — but haven’t been cutting benefits for people who were in the old plans.But my company’s pension plan assets aren’t mingled with any other plan. So I’m safe?Maybe. Nothing in the proposed bill affects pooled plans that are in good financial shape, or any of the plans offered by single employers. But if the bill passes, it will break promises that employers made to their workers, Karen Friedman of the Pension Rights Center told Bloomberg earlier this year. “It’s going to lead to a society where nobody can depend on anything.”Source

Patrick Randak/NBC; LinkedinHas Kate Gosselin finally met her titanium man?The Kate Plus 8 star has been dating 51-year-old businessman Jeff Prescott for several months, E! News can exclusively report.Prescott, a divorced father of three, is the COO and co-founder of Dreamstime, an Internet-based stockpiler and supplier of digital images for media outlets and both corporate and personal clientele.In 2007, the Brentwood, Tenn.-based company's value was heading toward $15 million, according to the Nashville Business Journal, and some reports have pegged it as being worth 20 times' that today.But what about his relationship with Kate, you ask?!PHOTOS: Stars who aren't shy about packing on the PDAMarcus/Zodiac/Splash NewsThese two have been pretty tight since at least October, when there were sightings of them in New York City, where she had been shooting the upcoming season of Celebrity Apprentice. However, the relatively new couple have obviously kept a low profile, refraining from venturing out in public side-by-side—a handy way to evade the paparazzi's ever-present lens.But since we know how particular Kate has been as far as letting a man into her life since her divorce from Jon Gosselin in 2009, Prescott has got to be quite the guy. The list of causes he's involved with would certainly attest to that: He's president of the Deaf Children's Foundation, Octagon Sports Nutrition and the Nature's Youth Fit Kids Foundation, as well as director of Nature's Youth.PHOTOS: The reality of Jon & Kate Plus 8HCI BooksBack in 2011, Kate told E!

"If there's anyone out there who wants to deal with us," she said, referring to the built-in chaos that comes with having eight kids and being famous, "that would be good."The tabloid fixture seemed to be taking a break from the ole ball game last year to focus on her family and work, telling us, "I don't think that I look for a future person as far as, 'Come in, help me raise my eight kids!'""If someone is willing to do that, that could be the right person, but it's certainly not something I expect," the reality-TV star said. "It's a shocking life. You can talk, talk, talk and to walk in my door and actually try that on and wear it, gosh, that's going to have to be a brave person. I don't know. Maybe I don't believe that person exists."And with that much more life experience under her belt this past June, when asked if there were any potential suitors on the horizon, Kate told E!

Steel doesn't cut it anymore."Well, may the CEO of Dreamstime prove his mettle.PHOTOS: When they're ready...may we recommend these hot couples on Instagram for photographic inspiration
http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/hilkevitch/ct-ohare-a380-gates-getting-around-met-1006-20141012-column.html	O'Hare takes step to host huge Airbus A380	The new runway that opened a year ago at O'Hare International Airport is both long and wide enough to handle the world's largest passenger airplane. But the behemoth Airbus A380 jetliner is not yet flying to Chicago, in part because there isn't a gate that can accommodate it.Soon that could change, Chicago aviation officials told the Tribune.All 34 airlines serving the airport's international terminal No. 5 have agreed to a city request to pay a total of $1 million for preliminary design of new aircraft ramps and passenger loading bridges tailored for the A380, according to the Chicago Department of Aviation.The double-deck aircraft stands 79 feet tall, is the length of a 24-story building laid on its side and has a wingspan that stretches almost 262 feet.An A380 operated by the German airline Lufthansa visited O'Hare in 2007 as part of a U.S. tour and to complete FAA-mandated technical procedures before passenger service could begin in this country. The plane parked far from the airport's terminals and stairs were rolled up to one door for visitors to take a peek inside.Runway 10 Center/28 Center, which opened last October, and a nearby taxi route are rated to handle the supersized A380. The city has applied to the Federal Aviation Administration for variances to allow the A380 to use other runways and taxiways until all phases of the O'Hare expansion plan are completed and more permanent options for takeoffs, landings and taxiing are available.But completion of the O'Hare Modernization Program could be years away. And the FAA said it will not respond to Chicago's request for temporary modifications of standards on airfield usage until an airline that operates A380s signs a letter of intent to begin service with the plane at a specific date at O'Hare, the FAA said.Some taxiways have already been modified to make room for the wider turning radius of the A380, and the bridges that extend over Interstate Highway 190 have been reinforced to bear the weight of the A380, officials said.So the immediate focus is on addressing the inadequacies of the existing jet bridges to handle A380s. The city and its consultants are evaluating where new gates could be built at Terminal 5, both to accommodate the mega-jetliner and to increase the number of gates for planes as large as Boeing 747s from the current 12 gates to as many as 17 gates, said O'Hare spokesman Gregg Cunningham. Terminal 5 has a total of 21 gates.Possible improvements to the inside of the terminal are also being reviewed, ranging from the ticketing hall and departure lounges to the baggage claim areas, to better accommodate the more than 500 passengers who will board and exit each A380.City officials said cost estimates will be made after the necessary modifications are determined. The Aviation Department received six proposals for a preliminary design concept and it expects to select a designer this month, Cunningham said. A comprehensive plan will be presented to the airlines early next year, he said.The A380, which carries up to 555 passengers in a three-class layout, is served at six airports in the U.S. and two airports in Canada by using at least one and often two boarding bridges at the main deck level and one bridge to the upper deck, according to Airbus.Chicago's goal is to begin A380 service at O'Hare as early as 2016, officials said.The list of airlines paying for the A380 airport design work includes United Airlines and American Airlines, which are contributing the largest shares. The payment levels are based on the number of flights each airline operates at Terminal 5, officials said.Neither American nor United operates A380s, and both airlines said there are no plans to add them to the fleets.In addition, the two airlines said they have no plans to help fund A380-related construction when the project progresses to that point."We believe that the airlines driving these new infrastructure demands should financially support any resulting improvements," United spokesman Luke Punzenberger said.American spokeswoman Leslie Scott said the Fort Worth-based airline's support for preliminary design work is "based on our determination that a project meets a demonstrated need at the airport, not necessarily that it benefits us directly."Final approval of the design for the Terminal 5 build-out hinges on the commitment of airlines to operate the A380 at O'Hare, officials said.Airlines serving O'Hare that fly the A380 elsewhere are Air France, Asiana Airlines, British Airways, Emirates Airline, Etihad Airways, Korean Air, Lufthansa and Qatar Airways.The CEO of Emirates, which in August launched one daily nonstop flight between Chicago and Dubai flying Boeing 777 jets, has mentioned O'Hare in the airline's expansion plans. Emirates operates 50 A380s currently and plans to purchase 90 more.Tim Clark, Emirates' CEO and president, told the World Routes aviation conference in Chicago last month that more infrastructure is needed at many airports to accommodate newer, larger planes."In the end, you could build all these wonderful planes, but if they can't go anywhere because you don't have the airports for them, you might as well go home and make bread," Clark said.Although early predictions by Airbus that some airlines might outfit A380s with bowling alleys and boutique shopping malls never proved true, Emirates designed its A380s with suites that feature showers or baths. Currently, 517 is the largest seat count that Emirates operates, Clark said.Clark said he would like to stretch the fuselage of the A380 to accommodate 850 seats in three service classes.When that happens, Clark said, Emirates would like to "pop them into Chicago twice a day."Contact Getting Around at jhilkevitch@tribune.com or c/o the Chicago Tribune, 435 N.

https://www.yahoo.com/style/calvin-kleins-idea-of-plus-size-is-pissing-people-off-102274897493.html	The Debate Over Calvin Klein's 'Plus Size' Model	@roemcdermott/TwitterMyla Dalbesio is a size 10. She’s smaller than the average woman — size 14 — but larger than a sample size. Because she doesn’t fit into a size 0 or 2, she has been called plus size, typically a size 12 and up. But looking at the 27-year-old model, who just debuted as the face of Calvin Klein’s “Perfectly Fit” campaign, she obviously doesn’t fit in with the skinny girls but she certainly isn’t shopping in the plus size section and her representing the category is perplexing to many people.  Lara Stone, Jourdan Dunn, and Ji Hye Park are the other models featured alongside Dalbesio and while she’s larger than them, and comparatively to her peers, she’s just the biggest in the group, but not necessarily big enough to be considered plus size. On Twitter, Jacqueline Ford calls the categorization a “joke,” Katrine Reichert writes that it’s “fat shaming,” Donna L. Bridges says it’s a “visual paradox,” and Susan E. Sponberg asks “where’s the plus?” Those sounding off on social media though aren’t alone in their bafflement. “It’s kind of confusing because I’m a bigger girl,” Dalbesio says in the latest issue of Elle magazine. “I’m not the biggest girl on the market but I’m definitely bigger than all the girls [Calvin Klein] has ever worked with, so that is really intimidating.”But just because Dalbesio is “bigger than all the girls [Calvin Klein] has ever worked with,” doesn’t mean that she’s evocative of a population that generally lacks representation within the mainstream fashion industry. While Calvin Klein has chosen to feature Dalbesio alongside the “straight size” models without fanfare, not making a distinction between the models, perhaps that decision was misguided. Instead, the message — not drawing a distinction between sizes in the marketplace — has gotten lost in the misunderstanding.A Calvin Klein spokeswoman told the New York Times that the “Perfectly Fit line was created to celebrate and cater to the needs of different women, and these images are intended to communicate that our new line is more inclusive and available in several silhouettes in an extensive range of sizes.”As Elle points out, featuring plus size models on magazine covers and calendars has typically been a stunt to draw attention and Calvin Klein opting to remain silent on the issue, rather than flaunting it, should indicate that progress is being made and normalizing all sizes in advertising. But at a time when Victoria’s Secret comes under fire for unintentionally saying what the “Perfect Body" and Walmart labels its plus size section for "Fat Girls,” being explicitly clear on intentions is more important than ever.

The actor recently admitted he felt jealous about Ben Affleck taking over as Batman, revealing he was never even asked to return to the part. The latest bomb came when Bale gave his opinion on the ending of "The Dark Knight Rises."In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Bale revealed that he believes the ending of the movie was no dream. It really happened.The scene in question shows Alfred spotting Bruce Wayne with Selina Kyle at a cafe. They acknowledge each other, and Alfred leaves.Because this is a Christopher Nolan movie and he's known for some great ambiguous endings (Can someone just pick up that top already?), there has been a lot of speculation that this sequence of events only happens in Alfred's head. This is partly because Alfred describes a similar scene to Wayne earlier in the film and partly because everyone thought Batman had been blown up by a nuclear bomb."My personal opinion is that no, it was not a dream, that that was for real," Bale told EW. It's true that this is just Bale's opinion, but seriously, if you can't trust Batman, then who can you trust? Listen to Bale's full interpretation of the ending:For the full interview, head to Entertainment Weekly.
http://gamerant.com/david-jaffe-new-action-game/	David Jaffe’s New Game To Be Revealed Next Month	Having been the director and designer of some of PlayStation‘s most famous series’ (including God of War and Twisted Metal) David Jaffe is a well-liked and well-known name in gaming. But he surprised many and followers in 2012 when he left Eat Sleep Play (a studio he co-founded) for a different path in his career.The studio that came out of that move is called The Bartlet Jones Supernatural Detective Agency. The Bartlet Jones team has yet to release a game in its two-year history but next month at the PlayStation Experience event in Las Vegas, we’ll finally get a glimpse at what Jaffe and co. have been working on all this time.A teaser ahead of a formal reveal, at 18 seconds in the PlayStation Experience video points us to this website. The site bears no features other than another equally as vague bit of footage.Featuring the crazed, cake-covered face of David Jaffe along with some ghost-themed props, their game could possibly be a spooky, psychological thriller. That fits in line with the studio’s backstory too. When Jaffe set up shop, he revealed that ‘Bartlet Jones’ is actually a real life supernatural investigator. Although Jones was approaching his 79th birthday, his appetite for ghost-hunting was still strong and Jaffe had accompanied him on several ghost-hunting trips and had learnt all about curing werewolves.Although the story of Bartlet Jones is likely a marketing ploy similar to the I Love Bees campaign for Halo 2 or P.T. Silent Hills, Jaffe is adamant that Jones is a real-life person. Though, of the other videos of the Bartlet Jones team, Jones is mysteriously absent.Other information about what the studio is working on comes from LinkedIn. The official description of the team says the following:“The Bartlet Jones Supernatural Detective Agency is a new game development studio located in the heart of San Diego’s Gaslamp District. The company is headed up by David Jaffe (God of War, Twisted Metal) and Nick Kononelos (SCEA) and the agency’s Technical Director is longtime industry vet and rockstar programmer Michael Riccio (SCEA, High Moon Studios). Our company is fully funded and is currently creating our first game- an action title based on an original IP. We are actively searching for talented teammates to join the agency (especially programmers with Unity and/or online experience).”In an interview with Polygon last year, Jaffe also added that “I wouldn’t say it’s a grand huge epic game like Skyrim, but I will say when people play it, hopefully they will have a huge amount of fun and immediately see it is a portal into a much bigger universe in terms of IP and story and character.”As for what platforms the mysterious game could be coming to, a PlayStation Experience reveal and a team full of SCEA (Sony Computer Entertainment American) veterans seems to suggest that the first Bartlet Jones game will be a PlayStation exclusive. However, Jaffe has also mentioned that Ubisoft or Microsoft could be the publisher so hopefully we’ll get more details on platform (along with gameplay and a name) in a few weeks.Source: vg24/7

When he left her just five days before the wedding, the game plan -- and life as Swink knew it -- quickly changed.Swink, 23, spent the next few days in shock, rushing to call guests and cancel services. But moping around was the last thing she wanted to do when Nov. 1 rolled around. When wedding photographer Elizabeth Hoard mentioned doing a "trash the dress" photo shoot with friends and family that day, Swink was game."I knew that a pity party was the farthest thing from what I wanted or needed," the Tennessee resident said.Photo courtesy of Elizabeth Hoard PhotographyHer bridesmaids were just as game as she was for the dress-destroying shoot. "My friend Carol threw her paint on me, not hesitating for one second, and it splashed all over my dress," Swink told The Huffington Post. "That's when I suddenly realized that the dress didn't matter. It was merely a material item."Photo courtesy of Elizabeth Hoard PhotographyWith each flick of paint, Swink felt more and more free: "I let go of everything I was feeling before. I felt free of sadness, free of disappointment, free of anger. I let all of that go and let happiness take over," she said. "Nov.1 was supposed to be a day full of happiness surrounded by loved ones, and that's exactly what it was!"Photo courtesy of Elizabeth Hoard PhotographyThough Swink had initially worried her parents wouldn't support the idea, they showed up, too. "My mom had spent so much money on the dress," she said. "But they were 100 percent supportive. They told me that the money didn't matter in the end. The only thing that mattered to them was my happiness."Photo courtesy of Elizabeth Hoard PhotographyIn the end, the once white gown was a rainbow-colored mess, with paint-plastered feathers scattered all over it.Photo courtesy of Elizabeth Hoard PhotographyToday, the dress is being displayed in a local bridal shop in Memphis until early January (a portion of the shop's sales during this time will go to local nonprofit called Be Free Revolution). As for Swink, she says the roller-coaster experience has reminded her to look inward for happiness."We define our own happiness, not who we're with," she said. "You have to face life head on and use the lemons it gives you to make some awesome lemonade! Everything happens for a reason."Photo courtesy of Elizabeth Hoard PhotographyKeep in touch!

http://www.aol.com/article/2014/04/16/utah-police-megan-huntsman-gave-birth-at-home/20870621/	Utah Police: Megan Huntsman gave birth at home	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A Utah woman accused of concealing seven pregnancies before strangling or suffocating her newborns gave birth each time in her home, authorities said Wednesday.Investigators have determined that Megan Huntsman, 39, did not go to a hospital to have the babies, Pleasant Grove Police Capt. Mike Roberts said. He didn't say if anybody helped her give birth.After her estranged husband discovered one of the infant corpses in the garage this past weekend, Huntsman acknowledged to police that she killed six of the babies, put them in plastic bags and then packed them inside boxes in the garage of her home south of Salt Lake City over a decade from 1996 to 2006. She told police one of the babies was stillborn.Huntsman was arrested Sunday on six counts of murder. She is being held on $6 million bail - $1 million for each baby - and is due in court Monday for an arraignment.Investigators have an initial theory on Huntsman's motive but aren't discussing it publicly, Roberts said.He did say that Huntsman also hid her pregnancies with her two oldest daughters, now in their early 20s, from extended family until she was at the hospital. Neighbors have said they never knew she was pregnant, though they now remember weight fluctuations and toggling between baggy and tight clothes."So, she apparently knows how to do it," Roberts said.Her husband, Darren West, told police in his initial interview that he knew nothing about the pregnancies, Roberts said. He has since obtained an attorney and investigators haven't spoken with him again, Roberts said. They are trying to determine his knowledge or involvement.If Huntsman's timeline is accurate, that would mean West was living with Huntsman during the time of the births. He went to federal prison in 2006 after pleading guilty to possessing chemicals intended to be used in manufacturing methamphetamine. West was released from a federal prison in California in January and transferred to a halfway house in Salt Lake City.Through a family spokesman, West has declined comment. The West family has said in a statement released Sunday that they are in a "state of shock and confusion" and that they're mourning "this tragic loss of life."Utah investigators are examining DNA from the babies to determine who the parents are, studying the bones to find out how long ago the babies died and have questioned family members and neighbors in pursuit of clues about how she did it. They are trying to determine why she did it and who else, if anybody, knew about it or was involved.They have not ruled out making more arrests.On Tuesday, they served a new search warrant at the house of a family member, Roberts said, but that turned up nothing useful.He said investigators are poring over evidence to find out if Huntsman gave birth and killed any other babies, but they don't believe that to be the case, he said.---Associated Press news researcher Rhonda Shafner in New York contributed to this report.
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/12/08/future-growth-of-solar-energy-will-shock-you.aspx	The Future Growth of Solar Energy Will Shock You	The energy industry hasn't been disrupted in a meaningful way since oil replaced coal as the main transportation fuel over a century ago. Today, solar energy is on the cusp of upending everything we know about energy, making it possible for households to produce energy, making unproductive desert land into highly productive generating assets, and upending the utility electricity model that's been in place since the days of Thomas Edison.Just how big can the solar industry be? The opportunity can literally be measured in trillions of dollars.The next great investing opportunityToday, the solar industry is a $120 billion industry, which sounds big but that's a figure that needs a lot of context. The world spends $2 trillion every year on electricity and $2.7 trillion on oil at $80 per barrel. Energy is a huge potential market if solar can disrupt it.What's incredible is that industry analysts are expecting the solar industry to grow 10x over the next 20 years as solar energy competes with conventional electricity on price. That's probably conservative given the exponential growth we could see if demand for solar energy picks up.I recently talked to SunPower's (NASDAQ: SPWR  ) CEO Tom Werner and he put the industry's potential into some context.This is just a piece of a larger interview, which can be seen here.Growth could be faster than anyone thinksWhile growing 10x sounds impressive, I think that's short changing the solar industry's potential. Remember, enough solar energy hits the earth every hour to power every electrical device, every car, everything that takes energy for an entire year. If companies can cost effectively harness that energy the potential is there for exponential growth.Consider that the U.S. alone can generate over 1,000 million kilowatts of electricity at summer peak capacity. That would be 1,000 GW of solar capacity in the U.S. alone and that's just peak at power. Solar energy is only 20% to 30% efficient because the sun is only up on average for half of the day, so much more capacity would be needed to power the whole country.  Since the solar industry in the U.S. is only 6.5 GW  this year to reach 1,000 GW of installed capacity the industry would have to grow 20% per year for 19 years. That's much faster than the 12% it would take to grow 10x in 20 years. And that's just the U.S.The point is that growth in solar industry growth could easily exceed 20% for the next decade and the companies who can gain market share could become some of the largest energy companies in the world. If you're not participating in the solar energy revolution, now may be the time to start looking into it.Another opportunity you shouldn't pass up 2015 is shaping up to be another great year for stocks. But if you want to make sure that 2015 is your best investing year ever, you need to know where to start.

http://bangordailynews.com/2015/08/18/living/blogs-and-columns-living/whats-really-sad-about-that-nature-valley-video-its-not-what-you-think/	What’s really sad about that Nature Valley video (It’s not what you think)	Nature Valley, the granola company, put out a new video — a “chilling” video, according to many people — this summer as part of its #rediscovernature campaign. In it, an off-camera voice asks three generations of people some variation of the same question: “When you were young, what did you do for fun?”One of my favorite responses comes from an elderly man who recounts having a basket full of fish and seeing a black bear. He decided that if the bear started chasing him, he would “keep throwing the fish out of my basket until [the bear’s] gorged and he won’t bother me.” There is no mention of where the man’s parents were at the time.In a different interview, a woman talks about building “massive forts … the kind you can sit in” with her friends, and a grown man says he liked to go door-to-door and round up all the neighborhood kids for a game of hide-and-seek or baseball. Another elderly man remembers fashioning his own, possibly dangerous, toboggan that was “very slick and very fast.”Again, there is no mention of parents.Then the interviewers turn to today’s children and ask what they do for fun. As you might expect, the kids only list tablets, video games and other handheld devices. There are no dangerous escapades or unleashed afternoons roaming the neighborhood streets. And their parents and grandparents, the ones who were interviewed earlier, are sad about that.The Internet’s response to this video was also sad — and swift. I saw it reposted in my Facebook news feed at least a couple dozen times. People bemoaned our electronics-obsessed youth and the fact that kids today have no sense of adventure.Now, let me tell you about something that happened this weekend.We were visiting my parents’ lake house, and I was still inside getting into my bathing suit and sunscreen. Unbeknownst to me, Ford, almost 15, and Owen, almost 13, went outside and got in the lake by themselves. They were swimming by the wooden floating dock a hundred feet offshore. The dock has a rustic, splintered ladder for climbing out of the water, and at some point, Ford had the brilliant idea to jump off it.But Ford didn’t just want to jump off the ladder’s steps; he wanted to climb up onto the makeshift hand railing, which is also rustic and splintered, and actually isn’t a hand railing at all. It’s the two-by-fours that make the sides of the ladder and stick up out of the water.Ford planned to put one foot on the narrowest end of one two-by-four and one foot on the other. He was going to balance “Karate Kid”-style until he jumped backward into the lake.Things didn’t go as planned.As soon as Ford was “balanced” on one “hand rail” and lifted his left foot to place on the other, he fell backwards. Which should have been fine since there was only a lake behind him, but Ford’s outstretched leg landed on the hand rail first, and then it violently slid down the side, scraping off skin as it went.When Ford came inside to show me, he already had a grapefruit-size bruise on the back of his thigh. And Owen trailed behind him, almost unable to talk he was laughing so hard about what he had just witnessed.Trust me, I know it could have been much worse. In fact, it very easily could have been. I saw visions of Ford’s head hitting the dock, or him breaking his leg and being unable to swim when he landed in the lake. And, of course, the first thing I did was yell at both boys for getting in the water before I was outside.But watch people’s reactions to this story. Pay attention to the comments. I can already guess what they will be:“I can’t believe she let her kids go near the water by themselves.”“How stupid was her son to attempt such a thing?”“Why wasn’t she watching them?”The commenters might as well just say, “Why weren’t these boys inside playing video games, where they’d at least be safe?”You see, I don’t think kids have really changed at all. They are still full of (sometimes) reckless adventure. They would go fishing and risk being chased by a bear … if their parents would let them. They would go door-to-door and round up neighborhood kids .. if their parents would let them. They would make dangerous, slick toboggans … if they didn’t have to sled with their parents and wear a helmet.So when you feel sad about Nature Valley’s video, stop and ask yourself: Can a generation of kids who have never known fishing by themselves really be to blame for the fact that a generation of grown-ups who came home when the streetlights came on won’t let their own kids do the same?Maine author and columnist Sarah Smiley’s writing is syndicated weekly to publications across the country.

Stretching over 9,200 square feet, her newly-built home has a futuristic glass and steel exterior.According to plans and permits filed with the city of Menlo Park, the house has 6 bedrooms and 6 bathrooms. The first floor has a great room stretching over 800 square feet and a subterranean basement houses an office, gym, wine room, theater, and guest bedroom. Atop the home, Sandberg installed solar panels and a “living roof.”The Symon Group of Alain Pinel Realtors represented Sandberg and Goldberg in the sale and Kay Wang, also of Alain Pinel Realtors, represented the buyer.
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/09/snooze-button-sleep_n_4509581.html?utm_hp_ref=healthy-living	How The Snooze Button Affects Your Sleep	By Robert Rosenberg, DOI am often asked by my patients if it is okay to keep hitting the snooze button for those extra zzzz’s. They want to know if it is beneficial or detrimental. My answer is: Ask yourself why do you need to do that, and does it really make you feel better? In reality, it may not only be a sign of inadequate or poor quality sleep, but it can make functioning during the day even more difficult.In many instances, you may be suffering from what we call social jet lag. You sleep much longer on weekends but on weekdays, given the pressure of a job or family, you can’t. Hitting the snooze alarm is a fruitless effort to obtain the sleep that you really need.When you hit the snooze alarm, you are disrupting your current stage of sleep. Unfortunately, in many ways, fragmented sleep is worse than no sleep. As an example, if you are in REM sleep and you interrupt it with the snooze alarm, this can lead to an inability to process and reconcile emotionally laden memories from the previous day. In addition, fragmented sleep can result in moodiness, cognitive problems, and trouble paying attention.What can we do to avoid this? First, we must realize that in many cases our body is telling us that we are not getting enough sleep. Try going to bed one-half hour earlier. Turn off all blue light emitting devices at least one hour before bedtime. Blue light delays the production of melatonin that results in lingering amounts of the sleep hormone in your blood stream upon awakening. Is it any wonder you can’t wake up?Other remedies include putting the alarm clock where you cannot reach it; using alarm clocks that work by putting out ever-increasing amounts of light as wake-up time approaches; having a coffee maker with a timer set for ten minutes before wake time and close enough so that you can smell it. Even getting a device that can automatically increase your bedroom temperature about one hour before it is time to get up can be helpful, as rising body temperature is another signal to wake up.The bottom line is that if you chronically find the need to hit the snooze alarm, something is probably wrong. You may be out of sync with your internal circadian clock. You may be a night owl trying to keep the work schedule of a morning lark. You may be someone who is failing at attempting to burn the candle at both ends. Alternatively, you may have a sleep disorder that unbeknownst to you is disrupting and depriving you of quality sleep. Hitting the snooze button is a poor substitute for healthy sleep.More from Everyday Health: Top Cardiology Innovations of 2013 4 Vital Tips for Saving your Skin this Winter 6 Bogus Psoriasis TreatmentsHow The Snooze Button Affects Your Sleep originally appeared on Everyday Health
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/07/04/france-mom-kills-kindergarten-teacher-in-class/20925337/	France: Mom kills kindergarten teacher in class	PARIS (AP) - The mother of a pupil at a French pre-school stabbed a teacher to death in front of her class Friday, the last day of the school year, authorities said.The education minister said the mother apparently had "serious psychiatric problems," and pledged support for teachers in the face of angry or violent parents. Police said the mother was taken into custody.Deadly attacks in a school are extremely rare in France, and the stabbing in front of a class of 5- and 6-year-olds raised concern at the highest levels. French President Francois Hollande expressed outrage at the attack at the Edouard Herriot school in Albi in southern France.Education Minister Benoit Hamon traveled immediately to the school, and told reporters that the mother of a pupil "committed this abominable act in a class against a remarkable teacher." A police official said the mother stabbed the teacher with a knife soon after school started Friday morning.Hamon said the attacker's child had been in the school only for a month and a half, and the mother had had very little contact with the school staff until Friday. It was unclear whether her 5-year-old daughter was in class at the time of the attack.Police and city officials would not comment on possible reasons for the attack on Fabienne Terral-Calmès, 34. The slain teacher had two small daughters, Hamon said.The regional prosecutor was expected to speak publicly about the case Friday evening.After Friday's attack, "the children were immediately taken in by another teacher who brought them to another classroom to talk to them, to tell them stories, to try to break them away from what they had just lived through," Hamon said.Marie-Odile Gay, a member of the regional health and safety committee for the Education Ministry, said the mother thought the teacher had called her daughter a thief, and that misperception might have played a role in the attack.Gay said that the mother, 47, had received psychiatric counseling in the past, and had been accused by police earlier this year of abandoning her 15-year-old son.Gay said the 5-year-old daughter had not had any difficulties in school, and was transferred Friday to the care of social services."This is something that will stay with her forever," Gay said. "It's very important to ensure that she is cared for."Some teachers complained that staff cuts have left teachers more vulnerable, and urged better attention to the tensions they face with some parents.But fellow teacher Robert Couffignal of the regional teachers union insisted that the attack was an "isolated case" that had nothing to do with this particular school, and warned against going overboard with security measures as a result."Metal detectors at schools are not the answer," he told The Associated Press by telephone. "We want to have close contact with the parents that creates a link of trust."He said the larger problem for schools in his region and around France is tension over economic decline and lack of job prospects for young people, especially those from poor or immigrant backgrounds.The education minister lamented the especially painful timing of the attack."This July 4, the moment when we should be happy for all children that school is over, that vacations are beginning, that teachers successfully completed the school year, has been turned into a day of mourning ... by this abominable crime," Hamon said.France still feels scars from a shooting at a Jewish school in Toulouse in southern France in 2012 that left three children and a rabbi dead.

Lady Gaga appeared on Howard Stern's SiriusXM radio show on Tuesday, Dec. 2, where she discussed two famous Taylors: Taylor Swift and her boyfriend Taylor Kinney.Stern asked the "Just Dance" singer whether she and Swift, 24, were really lovers, as one caller outrageously claimed on his radio program. "I don't think she would be into that," Gaga responded.PHOTOS: Taylor's surprised faces"We've met a few times, and I can't say anything bad about her," she said.

http://www.aol.com/article/2014/12/11/mumps-spreading-through-suddenly-sick-nhl/21115190/	Mumps spreading through suddenly sick NHL	NEW YORK (AP) -- Once mumps invades a professional sports dressing room, it finds a fertile breeding ground and the NHL is finding that it is not easy to get rid of.Multiple players on multiple teams from coast to coast have come down with the mumps, an illness more typically associated with children.It started in Anaheim and plagued the Ducks, who had three players affected. The Minnesota Wild was next, with five victims. Tanner Glass of the New York Rangers then came down with it, and as recently as Wednesday, the New Jersey Devils had two players turn up sick."It is certainly an outbreak that was unexpected and has caused unwanted disruption at the team level, but it is not something we have any significant control over," NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly said. "As long as our clubs are doing what they need to do to minimize risk of contraction, we are hopeful that the wave of cases will run their course and life will return to normal."The Ducks hosted the Wild in mid-October, New Jersey and the Rangers played each other a few days later and Minnesota visited the Rangers not long after that before facing the Devils in mid-November. But it was not clear whether the teams shared the virus with each other or picked it up in other ways."You see the hits that they have, and sometimes the spraying of saliva," said Dr. Judith Aberg, chief of the infectious diseases division at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital. "I think they are high risk. I am surprised we haven't actually seen this before."The illness isn't just hitting hockey players, of course. Students on college campuses have also recently fallen victim in another close environment that promotes spreading of the very contagious virus."It is relatively uncommon since the vaccine was licensed in the early 1960s, but this year we've actually had more cases," Aberg said. "In 2013, we had less than 500 cases, and already this year we're looking at about 1,000 cases in the United States. One person is expected to infect 10 others."Millions are vaccinated at a young age, but Aberg said the immunity can wane with age and "10 to 20 percent of individuals who have been vaccinated may not have full protection."The NHL and the players' association have provided information to teams and players on ways to protect themselves against the mumps. Vaccination decisions for any disease are made by club medical staffs and the players themselves.The Rangers quickly moved to give boosters to players, and other teams have done the same. The Ducks cleaned and sterilized their entire operation following the outbreak that hit Corey Perry and others. Everyone was encouraged to get re-vaccinated and most did.Some affected players have already returned to the ice, and all should recover without lasting effects.Each season at training camp, players are encouraged to provide their vaccination records. Childhood vaccine programs are fairly universal and accessible worldwide, although aren't mandatory in every country, the NHLPA said."The NHLPA has been actively educating the players regarding the recent outbreak, while providing best practices on how to avoid contracting and spreading mumps," players' association spokesman Jonathan Weatherdon said.Many of the recommendations about locker room and bench behavior are similar to the standard precautions the NHL provides regarding the flu, which is similarly transmitted."Simple coughing and sneezing and getting those respiratory droplets on each other can cause the spread of mumps," Aberg said. "The problem is that it is contagious before you have symptoms. That's where it gets tricky because you don't know you're going to come down with the mumps, and you're contagious. Then you are contagious for five days or so after you have symptoms."The illness even felled Minnesota ironman defenseman Ryan Suter, the rare American-born player to be affected.Every Wild player was offered a booster shot last month when the virus surfaced. Suter decided not to take it, and paid the price. He was the fifth Minnesota player - all defensemen whose cubicles are next to each other - to come down with the mumps.Suter, who hadn't missed a game since joining the Wild in 2012, led the NHL in ice time each of the last two seasons."I probably wash my hands more than anybody," he said. "I go out of the way to make sure I'm a clean guy. So for me to get it, it stunk. I always tell these guys, `You've got to be mentally strong and you'll never get sick.' So they're all giving me a hard time."More from AOL.com: Police capture murder suspect in tense chase 'Wheel' host totally baffled by man in audience New twist in the investigation of burned woman
http://www.forbes.com/sites/johntobey/2014/10/13/stock-market-corrections-step-1-is-complete-now-to-step-2/?partner=yahootix	Stock Market Correction's Step 1 Is Complete, Now To Step 2	The first step in a correction phase is now complete. That first step involves shifting from confident bullishness to uncertainty. Evidence of the shift is in The Wall Street Journal articles: From October 1’s “Investors See Reasons To Jump Into Stocks” to October 11’s “Dow Erases Gains for the Year – Tumultuous Week Shatters Market Calm as Global Growth Fears Rattle Investors.”Why the change in the last ten days?On October 1, the stock market was already off its highs and was contending with signs of weakening growth (e.g., “Housing, Consumer Numbers Down” and “Oil Tanks as Supply Overwhelms Demand” in the same newspaper). However, bull market thinking was still the prevailing view, and the positive October 3 employment report reaffirmed it.Then the news turned predominately negative this past week. On Tuesday, Germany’s poor growth report heightened global growth worries, and helped the U.S. stock market fall sharply. Wednesday offered a seeming reprieve after the Fed released its 3-week old minutes late in the day. Then, having second thoughts, the market more than reversed itself on Thursday. Friday, the market piled it on with an unusual late day selloff in the already negative week.Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comThat did it. With the market well off its highs and fundamentals deteriorating, positive outlooks were overwhelmed, leading to a negative mental shift.So, what now? Is it time to be contrarian and buy?Probably not, for the following reasons:First, the growth outlook is less robust and more unsure. Concerns about global growth, international strife and central bank maneuverings have ramped up uncertainties. Therefore, there are no longer the positive expectations needed to support previous valuations and resume the 2013-14 bull market.Second, the technical picture is weak. The 2013-14 bull market was so steady that it produced few obvious (widely-accepted) support points. Therefore, it will take time to reestablish foundations upon which stocks can base upward moves.Third, the contrarian signs are missing. Issues like newsletter bearishness (see “A Key Indicator For This Stock Market: The ‘US Adviors’ Sentiment Report‘”), commentary tone and stock price behavior do not match that of previous selloff troughs. While uncertainty rules now, there is not the negative fundamental outlook and concern about stocks (in other words, “bearishness”) that accompany a correction bottom.The bottom lineThe past ten days’ weak growth news and falling stock market produced the first correction step – from bullishness to uncertainty.Importantly, with the market now in a correction period, it is likely not done falling because the usual contrarian signs of a bottom are missing. Those indications are what would complete the correction’s second step: from uncertainty to bearishness.So, it’s too early to buy, then?Generally, that is true, but not absolutely. Opportunities can pop up at anytime. It is just that there obviously are fewer standouts in a down market with weakening fundamentals. Another exception is buying “early.” With the realization that timing a market downturn is not foolproof, it can pay to go ahead and buy an excellent, long-term holding when the price looks “desirable” (i.e., not waiting for “cheap,” only to end up with nothing).
http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2015/08/20/3692972/quantifying-climate-change-in-californias-drought/	How Much Of California’s Drought Was Caused By Climate Change? Scientists Now Have The Answer.	Over the last few years, as California’s historic, four-year drought has intensified, scientists have found clues linking the extreme weather event to human-caused climate change. Now, a new study is the first to estimate just how much climate change contributed to the drought.The study, published Thursday in Geophysical Research Letters, found that climate change can be blamed for between 8 to 27 percent of the drought conditions between 2012 and 2014 and between 5 to 18 percent in 2014. Though these relative contributions of climate change differ between the two periods of time, due to differences in severity of the drought from year to year, the study said climate change’s absolute contribution was “virtually identical” between the two periods — meaning climate change has contributed a fairly steady amount to California’s drought over the last three years.To figure out how much anthropogenic warming contributed to California’s drought, the researchers looked at soil moisture data in various parts of the state for every month from 1901 through 2014. With the help of that data, “we know what the climate’s like in every month since 1901,” said Park Williams, assistant research professor at Columbia University’s Earth Institute and lead author of the study. “We are fairly certain as to how much precipitation fell in a given month in given location.”The researchers used that data to calculate how much water evaporated from the soil each month. When the researchers compared the data to climate models in California, Williams said, they were able to determine how much of the current drought could be blamed on climate change — an amount that, according to Williams, is likely closer to 20 percent than to 8 percent. Steadily rising temperatures due to climate change, along with natural weather variability in California, led to more and more water evaporating from the soil.The researchers used four different methods to estimate global warming trends, and, for every month and every California location studied, calculated 432 possible soil moistures. That rich supply of data helped give the researchers a reliable range of climate change’s contribution to the drought, but the data was too complex to glean one single percentage from it.“There is no one correct way to do this,” Williams said. “We can’t just ask the Earth exactly what’s been human-induced and what’s natural.”The study does make it a little easier to illustrate how climate change and natural variability interact in a drought situation, however. Natural weather variability means temperatures, precipitation levels, and humidity are constantly changing — but they’re changing while the undercurrent of climate change steadily brings temperatures up. Climate change, Williams said, “is like a bully that demands part of your money every year, and every year it demands more of your money than the year before. Every year, the bully — or atmosphere — is demanding more resources — or water — than ever before.”The bully, he said, “is breaking a record every single year and in a predictable way. We know in 2030 that the bully will be asking way more than it is right now. knowing that, we can be preparing more wisely in managing water resources to ensure that we can pay bully every year.”California’s drought has hit the state hard over the last four years, threatening its lucrative agriculture industry and leading to its first-ever mandatory restrictions of water use. The drought has broken record after record — in April, the state’s previous low-snowpack record was, in the words of California’s chief of snow surveys, “obliterated,” and temperature records have been broken multiple times already in 2015. It’s led to job losses in the agriculture industry, and according to one study will likely cost the state $2.74 billion this year — an increase over the $2.2 billion it cost last year.California’s drought, as of August 11. CREDIT: US Drought MonitorStudies besides Thursday’s have assessed the drought’s severity and linked it to climate change. A study from 2014 found that California’s drought was the most severe the state has had in the last 1,200 years. And a Stanford study from this March concluded that the region of high atmospheric pressure — dubbed the “ridiculously resilient ridge” — above the Pacific Ocean that’s been blocking storms from making their way to California was more likely to form under today’s climate change conditions than it would have been if global warming hadn’t been occurring.Thursday’s study “supports the previous work showing that temperature makes it harder for drought to break, and increases the long-term risk,” climatologist Noah Diffenbaugh, who led the Stanford research, said in a statement.That finding from the study — that droughts like the one in California are becoming increasingly likely in many areas because of climate change — is one of the study’s most important conclusions, Williams said. According to the study, higher levels of evaporation — driven by higher temperatures — will overtake any increases in rain that California is expected to have over the next few decades.“Severe drought years in California should occur 7 percent of time in warming-free scenario,” he said. “We now find that under the current amount of warming, the probability of a severe drought year has approximately doubled. So even though it may be argued that the human-induced part of the drought sounds small at 20 percent, it seems worse when you consider the probability of extreme drought has increased by 100 percent.”Historically, it’s been difficult to tie a particular weather event to climate change. But Williams said he thinks it’s getting easier, as new and improved climate datasets continue to come out and as computational abilities improve. And he says it’s important to keep doing studies like this that aim to figure out just how much climate change influenced a major event. He said he’s heard claims, both from researchers and from the media, of two extremes regarding California’s drought: one, that it was caused entirely by climate change, and two, that it was caused solely by natural weather variability. Both those claims, Williams said, are “equally dangerous.”“If all Californians believe that this drought is caused purely by natural variability, then they’re very unlikely to want to prepare for a trend towards increasing drought variability in the future,” he said. “If all Californians think this drought is caused purely by global warming, then when natural climate variability causes California to get wet in a few years, they’re going to be very surprised, and possibly prone to thinking that climate change is bogus. Knowing the true answer can allow for more educated decisions about how to prepare.”

The European-inspired redesign that replaces presidents with MOLECULES and has sparked a spirited debate	Artist Travis Purrington said we need currency that reflects evolved culture Waves, astronauts, mountains, molecules and buildings adorn his bills The dollar has hardly changed in 100 years, unlike European currenciesIt has barely changed in 100 years.But a proposed redesign for the dollar has left Americans up in arms. Instead of the archetypal green and trusty old presidents, the revamped version would feature astronauts, molecules and stars in a series of motifs about innovation.US artist Travis Purrington, who developed the designs for his thesis at Switzerland's Basel School of Design, said: 'One day we Americans will make a significant move in our currency design that reinforces the evolution of our cultural climate...this is where I would start'.Controversial: An American artist has released these images for a proposed redesign of the dollar billAn aerial view of fields is printed on the proposed $5 bill.The $10 note, according to Purrington, would feature a building or a molecule.New $20 bills would be adorned with a sparkling purple wave.Moving up to $50, we have an astronaut.And the peak of $100 is a mountain range or a starry sky.Each bill is printed with similar font to the euro, with a muted gray border.Muted: The paper notes would feature fields and molecules instead of revered presidents and dollar signsDramatic change: Instead of the archetypal green, Purrington would switch the bills to a light gray Change: The artist, based in Switzerland, says currency should reflect the evolution of our cultural climatePurrington was inspired by competitions held in European countries that let members of the public suggest new currency designs.'This idea of such a strong visual change every 20 years or so within a relatively conservative culture deeply rooted in banking lead me to ask, "Why couldn't the U.S. do this?"' Purrington told Slate.'And subsequently, 'What would it look like if the U.S. held such a competition?' 'Responding to his critics, Purrington insists the thesis was merely an attempt to inspire new designs.Innovation: Purrington was inspired by American innovation as well as European design featuresThe big bucks: Wealthy Americans could fill their wallets with mountain ranges and starry skiesAlternative: For those not fond of the nature photographs, he also fashioned scientific designsHow it would work: For his thesis, Purrington demonstrated the ways in which the note could work in practise'I simply wanted to introduce the idea that there is still room to grow and innovate in U.S. culture with currency,' he told Slate.'I'm not declaring that this proposal is a suitable replacement for the USD as much as I'm suggesting that one could exist,' he said.  He insists the idea is not ultramodern as it maintains paper form. But he assures his critics that it is 'transitional', not realistic.His inspiration came from European design movements of the 20th century and his observations since moving to Europe.'I tried to tie the concept of learning, discovery, authorship, and accountability into the notes in a way that was aesthetically conducive to the organisation of information more than I worried if it looked too European or not "American" enough,' Purrington wrote.HOW THE $100 BILL HASN'T REALLY CHANGED IN THE LAST 100 YEARS 1914: The first Federal Reserve $100 note is 7.3x3.1 inches with Franklin on the front and figures on the back1929: It is reduced to 6.1x2.6 inches, Franklin's portrait is changed, and Independence Hall is put on the back1990-1996: In the first revamp in 70 years, the bill was marginally altered, keeping Franklin and the Hall1996-2013: Franklin got a close-up six years later, when the numbers were made bold and borders straight2013-present: The Liberty Bell was added, as was a 3D security belt, in the latest redesign issued last year
http://fortune.com/2015/08/19/this-country-might-soon-be-giving-out-e-cigarettes-for-free-britain-nhs-public-health/	This country might soon be giving out e-cigarettes for free	England’s health service just came out with the biggest endorsement yet of e-cig safety. Health officials in Britain have publicly endorsed e-cigarettes as an efficient and desirable way to reduce the health risks from smoking and to encourage smokers to kick the habit entirely.Public Health England, which runs the National Health Service in the largest of the U.K.’s four nations, said that a review by independent experts had found e-cigarettes to be around 95% less harmful than smoking, and said popular perceptions that they were as harmful, or a gateway to more harmful cigarette smoking among younger users, were plain wrong.The review is arguably the biggest official endorsement yet for the practise of ‘vaping’, and may hasten the speed at which smokers drop conventional cigarettes for e-cigs. By contrast, the World Health Organization had said in 2013 that the safety of e-cigarettes “has not been scientifically demonstrated.”That could in turn increase the competition among traditional tobacco groups for the dwindling band of e-cigarette makers still in independent hands. Philip Morris International PM 0.50% , Lorillard Inc., British American Tobacco plc BTI 0.21% and Imperial Tobacco plc ITYBY -0.57% and others have all acquired makers of e-cigarettes since 2012 as an insurance policy against the trend of long-term decline in their traditional business.“My reading of the evidence is that smokers who switch to vaping remove almost all the risks smoking poses to their health,” said Peter Hajek, a professor at Queen Mary University in London who authored the review.In Britain, as elsewhere in the developed world, smoking is in decline thanks to changing in public attitudes, which have allowed government to raise tobacco taxes dramatically and drastically tighten the regulation of its marketing. In the last five years, the U.K. has raised the amount of tax on cigarette sales by 40%, while in April, it banned the display of traditional cigarettes in all retail outlets.There are no official data yet on how the ban has affected sales.However, Public Health England has all but explicitly blessed handing out e-cigarettes for free to those who sign up for the NHS’s Stop Smoking help services, on the reasoning that the cost will be more than recouped in public health benefits (smoking-related diseases are still the U.K.’s biggest killer).By contrast, a pack of 20 traditional cigarettes now costs upwards of $14. The economic incentives for the U.K.’s remaining 2.6 million smokers to abandon traditional cigarettes sooner rather than later are only piling up. If other health services follow the U.K.’s lead, tobacco’s slow death in the west could get a lot faster.
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/11/05/voters-give-nod-to-legal-marijuana-in-oregon-alaska-and-washin/20988896/	Voters give nod to legal marijuana in Oregon, Alaska, and Washington, D.C.	(Reuters) - Residents of Oregon, Alaska, and the U.S. capital voted to legalize marijuana on Tuesday, in key victories that could fuel the legalization movement as cannabis usage is increasingly recognized by the American mainstream.The Oregon and Alaska measures would legalize recreational pot use and usher in a network of retail pot shops similar to those operating in Washington state and Colorado, which in 2012 voted to become the first U.S. states to allow marijuana use for fun.A less far-reaching proposal in the District of Columbia to allow marijuana possession but not retail sales won nearly 65 percent of the vote with all precincts reporting, unofficial results showed.The referendums come amid shifts in American opinions on marijuana in recent years that have energized efforts to legalize cannabis, a drug that remains illegal under federal law even as Colorado and Washington state have been given the go-ahead to experiment with legalization."In 2016 we're going to push the ball forward in several states until we end prohibition," Leland Berger, a Portland attorney who helped write the new law, told Reuters outside a packed Portland nightclub where advocates declared victory amid pot-centric revelry.Advocates have portrayed the District of Columbia measure as a civil rights issue, saying studies have shown that African Americans are disproportionately more likely to be arrested on marijuana charges than are people of other races.The D.C. measure had been strongly favored to pass but could still be halted during a review by the U.S. Congress, which has constitutional oversight over the capital. The measure would allow adults 21 and older to possess up to two ounces (57 grams) of cannabis and grow up to six plants.POT OPPONENTS TO FIGHT ONThe Oregon law, which drew 54 percent support in preliminary returns, takes effect in July 2015 and stores could open the following year.The Alaska measure was leading by about 52-48 percent with nearly 97 percent of precincts reporting preliminary results late on Tuesday, and groups for and against the initiative said it had passed.If given official approval, a regulatory body would have nine months to write regulations after the election is certified and the measure becomes law, with stores likely coming at some point in 2016.Opponents of legal weed in Oregon say they would take their fight to the Oregon legislature, pushing for stricter laws designed to limit access to pot by children, among other efforts.Kevin Sabet, co-founder of anti-legalization group Smart Approaches to Marijuana, said his group would redouble its efforts to build a broader coalition to beat back better-funded pro-cannabis groups ahead of what is expected to be an expanded fight in 2016."Tonight is going to inspire us to do better and to try harder and go after the donors we have to go after in order to level the playing field," Sabet said. "The more people that hear about legalization, the more people are uncomfortable with it. For us it's about getting our message out."Meanwhile, a proposed constitutional amendment to make Florida the 24th state and the first in the South to allow medical marijuana was defeated after falling short of the 60 percent support needed to pass, according to groups both for and against the measure.In Maine, a proposal to legalize the possession of small amounts of recreational marijuana failed in Lewiston and passed in South Portland, advocacy groups said. In Guam, unofficial results indicated it became the first U.S. territory to approve medical marijuana, an election official there said.

It’s really, seriously going to the dogs.Flat 12 Bierwerks has launched Indy’s first “dog brew,” a non-alcoholic beer made especially for your canine companions. The beer is officially premiering Friday, Aug. 21, at the brewery’s pet adoption and supply drive for Heaven After Hell Rescue Shelter.And let’s just say tails are wagging.“I think every employee here owns a dog,” said the brewery’s marketing director Valerie Green. “We are all very dog-friendly.”So Green and head brewer Sean Manahan put their heads together to create the dog brew. “We wanted to make something really good for them, but also a treat. Plus it is safe, no alcohol and no carbonation.”The dog beer is made using meat bones and trimmings donated from the brewery’s neighbor Smoking Goose. Brewers create a stock with bones, carrots, potatoes, and brewer’s yeast. The stock simmers for three hours before it is blended with wort, the liquid extracted from the mashing process when brewing actual beer. It all comes together in a keg.Of course, the Flat 12 team has been testing it on their own dogs and “dog regulars,” who are quickly slurping the stuff up. And yes, they have even tasted it themselves. They say it tastes like a soup broth. My pup Snickers, aka @IndyBrewDog, was a big fan — we could hardly capture a picture before it was gone.The brewery plans to have the dog beer on tap as products are available from Smoking Goose. The cost of a bowl for your pooch is $1, and all proceeds will go to local animal shelters.Dogs will be available for adoption.

According to LiveLeak, which posted the video, the officer never presented a badge and that "San Jose police are notorious for this type of behavior." The officer followed the woman after the crash and attempted to detain her until uniformed could arrive. Based on this video, though, his efforts meant with questionable success. Eventually the woman's sister intervened, and they both managed to get away.KPIX5, the Bay Area CBS affiliate, confirmed that the man in question was in fact an officer, and that his "use of force" was investigated "at the scene with supervisor oversight," SJPD Sgt. Heather Randol said."During the altercation the female suspect assaulted the officer. She eventually ran to her car and drove away," Randol said, clarifying that the assault in question involved the women allegedly biting the officer.Both women have misdemeanor warrants for hit and run and using force against an officer, Sgt. Randol told KPIX.Now, as we often hazard in situations like this, we can't be at all certain of what went down before the video started rolling. That means we can't be judge, jury and executioner for the actions of either the women or the officer. Still, take a look at the video and let us know what you think. And be warned, there's plenty of foul language.

Lady Gaga pregnant rumors have been spreading like crazy this week after Mother Monster stepped out in New York City wearing a tight red sequin dress that accentuated a maybe-baby bump. According to the Daily Star, Gaga not only looked like she could be expecting her first child, but she also acted like it, as she seemed to place her hand gently on her tummy from time to time.“Although she has yet to confirm if congratulations are in order, Gaga did appear to be sending an indication of impending motherhood as she placed a protective hand on her tummy,” reports the Daily Star.Well, while Lady Gaga may have looked pregnant, Gossip Cop confirmed that she is not pregnant. A rep for the singer explained that the rumors are simply “not true.” Despite several media outlets reporting that Gaga had some exciting news to share, it appears as though she has just put on a spot of weight, or perhaps, her dress accentuated her stomach in a non-flattering way.Gaga’s weight has fluctuated from time to time, and this certainly isn’t the first time that pregnancy rumors have followed her around after a night out on the town. As previously reported by the Inquisitr, Gaga showed a fuller figure back in 2012, and people started talking babies back then, too. However, the Bad Romance singer blamed her weight gain on eating out. Apparently she had been spending way too much time at her dad’s restaurant in the Big Apple.“I love eating pasta and pizza. I’m a New York Italian girl. That’s why I have been staying out of New York. My father opened a restaurant. It’s so amazing. It’s so freaking delicious, but I’m telling you I gain five pounds every time I go in there.”If Lady Gaga was pregnant, there would be a super good chance that her beau, Taylor Kinney, was the baby’s dad. In a new interview, Gaga opened up about her relationship with the Chicago Fire actor, and just how spectacular it is.“I have that feeling with him. I just know it. I can’t really imagine being with anyone other than who I’m with right now. What I do feed off is my ability to be able to have an intelligent conversation with him about how it feels to be a creative person because a lot of people don’t always understand you.

The newborn girl’s parents buried her alive after she was born premature because they thought she was stillborn.The baby, who has not been named, was born to Chinese couple Lu Xiayun and her husband He Yong in a rural farming area of Dongdong in northeast China’s Liaoning Province.Lu was working on the farm when she felt a sudden sharp pain in her belly and went into labor unexpectedly. She gave birth in a pool of blood to what she thought was a stillborn infant at four months of pregnancy. She called her husband, He, who rushed home from work and found his wife with a preterm baby he also thought was stillborn.He called an ambulance. When the ambulance came, the staff asked for the baby, but He said his wife had suffered a miscarriage at four months of pregnancy and the baby had died.The Lucky Newborn Survived Being Buried AliveThe ambulance rushed Lu to the hospital while Lu’s mother buried the newborn girl under a tree in the family’s yard, believing she had died.But doctors at the hospital insisted that they would have to see the newborn to confirm she had actually died because they thought there was a chance she had survived despite being born premature.The father of the child, He, rushed back home and was shocked to learn that his mother-in-law had buried her. But he went to the yard and dug up the baby. And once again, he was shocked to find that the newborn was still breathing, and she had survived being buried alive for two hours.Lu Xiaoyun and He YongHe rushed the baby back to the hospital where doctors confirmed that contrary to Lu’s belief that she was four months pregnant when she went into labor and had a miscarriage, the baby was born premature at six months.Doctors took care of the newborn at the hospital and she survived. However, after three days of care at the hospital, He ran out of money to pay hospital bills and the baby was discharged.“My mother-in-law has chronic diseases and I also have a 7-year-old daughter. My wife doesn’t have a job. I am the only one who works.”But fortunately, the Chinese media picked up the story and soon people began donating to the family. The family has since been able to return the child to the hospital for further treatment.Doctors who were caring for the child in an incubator said her condition was improving, according to the Daily Mail.Chinese Newborn In An IncubatorAn unpleasant aspect of the reaction to the story was the suspicion that the family deliberately hastened to bury the child because it was a girl. However, Chinese media reports give no evidence to support this suspicion. But it is widely acknowledged that female infanticide has been practiced in China for centuries as a result of social, cultural and economic factors which confer an inferior status on the female child compared with the male child. The practice reportedly peaked during the years of the one-child policy of the Communist government.But with the Chinese government having recently eased the policy, it is hoped that the practice would abate.Lu and He also have a 7-year-old daughter. Lu’s mother, who buried the newborn, lives with the couple.[Images: HAP/Quirky China News/REX via Daily Mail]
http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/wolff/2014/03/16/the-future-of-business-insider/6370473/	New cash, new questions for Business Insider	Business Insider, one of the sites at the forefront of creating a native digital publishing model, happily announced the other day an additional investment of $12 million, bringing its total to about $30 million.Started by former securities analyst Henry Blodget and DoubleClick founder Kevin Ryan, the site, along with The Huffington Post, Gawker, BuzzFeed and Forbes, has helped pioneer a mix of aggregation, free contributions and syndication, along with original reporting and commentary. It has coupled this editorial approach with aggressive traffic-building strategies.This past fall, Business Insider sought to sell itself for $100 million in cash and found no takers (there were merger proposals, but no cash offers). Its $12 million in new money comes from existing investors — Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeff Bezos among them — meaning everybody merely contributed more money to keep their present ownership stakes, without raising the value of their shares.This lack of buyers and new investors may suggest a growing uncertainty about what the new publishing model is worth.What Business Insider and other traffic-focused digital publishing businesses have managed to do is amass large audiences. At Business Insider, there were 25.4 million unique visitors in January — Forbes and BuzzFeed are three and four times larger than this. Pretty great publishing numbers.BLODGETT: 'Business Insider' responds to Michael WolffBut the actual meaning and value of large digital audiences remain unclear. Only a small percentage of Business Insider's traffic actually seeks it out and regards it as a worthy destination and a source with particular brand authority. Most other readers land on a Business Insider article because of search-engine results, or because of an engaging — tabloid-style — headline in a Facebook feed and other social-media promotions, which generate 30% of Business Insider's traffic.In 2013, BI made more than $19 million, most of it selling this traffic to advertisers. It said it was profitable in the fourth quarter (usually a good quarter) and that it won't be profitable in 2014.It has to produce lots of content — quantity tending to trump quality — to realize these traffic goals. But Business Insider is seeking to be not just a content mill (a site that uses bulk amounts of low-level content to attract mass traffic) but also a significant new brand, which adds costs. It has hired, if not quite a seasoned staff, young journalists with at least a bit of experience: about 70 of them now, costing upwards of $15 million a year. Overhead and other traffic-acquisition costs push expenditures well past $19 million. In other words, it costs more to get traffic than what you can sell it for.In this, Business Insider finds itself in the CPM vice. The cost per thousand page views (CPMs) — a measurement beginning to be as common in conversations about digital media as movie grosses were in the 1980s — slides ever downward. This is a result of expanded inventory, general unhappiness with the results of digital advertising, lower-valued mobile space and the increasing prevalence of what's called programmatic buying (wherein a targeted audience can be assembled more cheaply outside of brands). In addition, as a site grows and its inventory expands, its CPMs decline. MailOnline, one of the most trafficked news sites, averages 160 million unique visitors a month — more than six times what Business Insider receives — but produces only $60 million in revenue, just three times more than Business Insider.The options for a site such as Business Insider for escaping the crunch of ever-increasing traffic costs and ever-lower returns are few.• You can produce content at a cheaper rate, using the content mill model, say, or the Forbes vanity model, letting "contributors" write whatever they want under your brand ("as I wrote in Forbes …") and not having to pay them anything — ultimately, of course, devaluing your authority.• You can concentrate on developing innovative traffic strategies, which might for a time lower traffic costs — but soon enough, your strategies become apparent to everyone else, and all you've succeeded in doing is increasing the pressure for more and more traffic.• You can figure out a new advertising model. Business Insider says it's going to use some of its new money to invest more heavily in video, which gets higher CPMs — but few news sites have unlocked the secret of actually getting people to watch the glut of cheaply produced digital video.• You can try to break the CPM model with conferences and subscriptions. But conferences, save for the choicest, are a hard-scrabble, low-margin business. And subscriptions … well, good luck.• You could accept a smaller business and make it profitable by carefully controlling your costs — but in the case of Business Insider, it's already taken too much investment to settle for a small business.Still, you build a reputation, gain an audience and develop a reasonably talented staff. In this view, you're poised to become some sort of yet-to-be-defined cross-platform-content-provider-cum-sponsorship-deal business. "There is no one revenue strategy," is how it's put.Part of the problem, in classic publishing terms, is that Business Insider, like the other traffic aggregators, is not an expression of a particular coherent vision or sensibility that people are compelled to seek out. It is, rather, running after the market instead of creating one.Business Insider, BuzzFeed, Gawker, et al., have created true modern brands — brands larger than their revenue streams and current value. That's a digital conundrum, illusion vs. reality.You can look at them as works in progress — or as houses of cards.Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1iSPua6

The U.S. troops, armed with “light and medium weapons,” and were able to inflict casualties against the ISIS fighters, forcing them to retreat, Shafaq News reported. The American troops were also aided by fighter jets, which directed air strikes against the ISIS troops that “silenced their heavy sources of fire.”“US forces intervened because of ISIS started to come near the base, which they are stationed in so out of self-defense,” said Sheikh Mahmud Nimrawi, a prominent tribal leader.The incident was the first time that American troops clashed with ISIS forces on the ground in Iraq. For several weeks, the United States has led a series of air strikes against ISIS positions in Iraq and Syria, ones aimed at crippling the militant group’s ability to move about the country and coordinate attacks.ISIS has responded by calling on members to strike out against American interests in the United States and Canada, and also executing Western hostages. Rebels are now reportedly trying to sell the body of American journalist James Foley for a reported $1 million.Militants are reportedly offering a DNA sample from Foley’s body to prove its authenticity.“They ask for $1 million, and they will send DNA to Turkey, but they want the money first. They will not give the DNA without the money,” a former Syrian rebel reportedly told BuzzFeed.The man claimed to be motivated not by greed or a quest for fame, but by a desire to help the mourning Foley family “find closure,” and deemed his outreach as part of a “humanity case.”The U.S. forces attacked by ISIS in Iraq were part of a small group that remained in the country to offer support and training to tribal fighters.

That puts the approximately $80,000 Z06 on par with the outgoing $180,000 Lamborghini Gallardo, the $1.5 million Ferrari 599XX, the $1.2 million McLaren P1 and the $103,365 Nissan GT-R. Is it the deal of the century? Signs point to yes.The 2.95-second sprint time comes courtesy of the company’s new eight-speed automatic transmission, which we tested a few weeks ago. The seven-speed manual can only achieve a sluglike 3.2 seconds.Similarly, the 10.95-second quarter-mile time is only achievable with the eight-speed auto; manual rowers get 11.2, which is the same time as the Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat. Chevy says both quarter miles end with a speed of 127 mph.Warp drive acceleration needs earth-shattering brakes, which the Z06 has. The deceleration from 60 mph takes just 99.6 feet, the best braking performance GM has ever reached. It beat the Corvette ZR1 around GM’s Milford Road Course by a full second, logging 1.2 g in corners.The results, GM GM, -0.21%   notes, were from a Z06 with a Z07 Performance Package, which adds Brembo carbon-ceramic rotors and Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires.The 2015 Corvette Z06 coupe, priced at $78,995 (including destination), goes on sale in early 2015, while the Z06 convertible goes on sale in the second quarter, priced at $83,995.

So what's really behind the popularity of Monster Energy drinks? Could it be... Satan?One woman seems to think so.In a video that went viral on Facebook and YouTube over the weekend, the unidentified woman recites a series of conspiracy theories about the drink. Specifically, the notion that the "M" in the "Monster" logo is really made up of a Hebrew "6," repeated three times.Yes, that would be "666.""You see these Ms everywhere -- hats, T-shirts, bumper stickers. Is there another agenda here?" the woman asks. "If God can use people and product, so can Satan."Still have doubts? She has more clues, such as claiming the line through the "o" in "Monster" is really part of a cross, which represents the Antichrist. She says that when someone drinks from a can and tilts it upside-down, the reversed cross represents witchcraft."Bottoms up, and the Devil laughs," she says. "Something to think about."She also points to the "Unleash the Beast" motto on each can as well as the company's supposed used of implied profanity in its marketing.Many of her complaints about the drink have circulated online before, with some users on the Snopes message board reporting a similar message circulating on Facebook in 2009. However, none of the others have spread this quickly.The Facebook clip posted by Andrew Blevins this weekend has already been viewed more than 8 million times while the YouTube version posted on Sunday racked up more 1.5 million views in less than 24 hours.Monster has not responded to numerous people sharing the video on its Facebook page. However, when these religious claims have surfaced in the past, others, including members of the Christian community, have pointed out that the so-called "number of the beast" is not three sixes, but 666 -- as in six hundred and sixty-six -- which would not be represented in Hebrew by a six repeated three times.Also difficult to explain would be the fact that Monster Beverage Corp., which owns the Monster Energy drink, also owns Peace Tea.(h/t Raw Story)

http://www.aol.com/article/2014/12/04/the-flu-vaccine-might-not-have-you-covered-this-year/21003132/	The flu vaccine might not have you covered this year	Doesn't it seem like we're always reporting that the latest flu vaccine might not keep up with the latest strain? Well, here's another unfortunate warning as we head into the depths of flu season.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says much of the flu virus going around this year has mutated, making this year's vaccine less effective. (Video via CNN)So far, most flu cases this year are being caused by a strain called H3N2.The vaccine to combat that strand was formulated months ago, and it worked ... at first. But because the strain has changed since then, it's now unable to protect against it as well.It's not uncommon for flu strains to mutate. Flu.gov explains flu viruses are constantly changing, and that's why we're supposed to get a flu shot every year.But there is some good news. Although the vaccine does not completely protect against the H3N2 mutation, it does offer some cross protection.Meaning the vaccine's formula still partially protects against viruses it wasn't specifically designed for. So it could reduce the chances of getting severe symptoms if the strain is contracted.In addition, the vaccine still adequately protects against the some of the other flu strains going around, and because of this, health officials are still recommending most people over six months of age get the shot. (Video via University Of Massachusetts Memorial Medical Center)Because more people might become ill this year with H3N2, the CDC is reminding doctors the antiviral drugs Tamiflu and Relenza are available to treat those who are infected.Flu season usually peaks between December and February.This video includes images from Getty Images.

Sinjar than previously feared,'' the Pentagon said in a statement. "The Yazidis who remain are in better condition than previously believed and continue to have access to the food and water that we have dropped."Fewer than 20 U.S. personnel flew in darkness early in the morning to the mountain, made their assessment, and returned safely to the Kurdistan capital of Irbil by military air transport.The interagency assessment team included members of the U.S. Agency for International Development.While the United States will continue to provide humanitarian assistance as needed, an evacuation mission to rescue thousands of the Yazidi religious minorities trapped on the mountain is "far less likely," the Pentagon statement said.Earlier Wednesday, a key U.S. national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, had said President Barack Obama would decide within days whether to send American military troops to help the Iraqi civilians, including Christians and members of the Yazidi religious sect.They had fled brutal militants in the Islamic State group, who’d threatened to kill them unless they converted to Islam.On Tuesday, the U.S. deployed another 129 military advisers to assess the situation on Mount Sinjar and elsewhere in northern Iraq."Our goal here is to work with the Iraqis and with international partners so that these people can get off that mountain and to a safer place," Rhodes said during a daily White House briefing, conducted in Edgartown, Massachusetts, where the president is vacationing with his family.   "Again, we don’t believe that that involves U.S. troops re-entering a combat role in Iraq."Obama has pledged that American troops, which he ordered withdrawn from Iraq in 2011, will not return to ground action in the current crisis.Last week, however, the U.S. leader authorized airstrikes against Islamic State fighters near Sinjar, with the attacks giving Kurdish fighters time to rescue more than 20,000 of those stranded on the mountain.U.S. planes have been carrying out airdrops to get supplies to the refugees.The military said late Tuesday it had conducted a sixth set of airdrops containing food and water, bringing the total amount of aid delivered so far to 100,000 meals and 27,000 gallons of water.Other allies assistEarlier this week, Massoud Barzani, president of Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish region, asked the international community for help fighting the militants. The European Union failed to agree on a deal to supply weapons but said individual countries were free to make their own deals with Iraq.On Wednesday, British Prime Minister David Cameron said an international plan is being developed to rescue the refugees. He cut short his vacation in Portugal Wednesday to return to London to meet with advisers on the humanitarian crisis.Cameron rejected demands by some British lawmakers to intervene militarily in Iraq. But he said Britain would play a role in the rescue plan, just as it already has with the United States in dropping food and water to the marooned refugees, some of whom have died in the extreme heat."I can confirm that detailed plans are now being put in place and are underway and that Britain will play a role in delivering them," Cameron said.Also Wednesday, French President Francois Hollande's office said arms would be delivered in a matter of hours to Kurdish forces, with the coordination of the Iraqi government.Maliki digs inMeanwhile, Iraq's incumbent Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki said he will not give up power until a federal court rules on President Fouad Massoum's decision to appoint Haider al-Abadi to take over the leadership post.Maliki said during his weekly address Wednesday that Abadi's appointment to replace him violated the constitution and "had no value."   Maliki's critics accuse him of marginalizing Iraq's minorities.He has been trying to extend his eight-year rule for a third term as Iraq moves to form a new government, but he has lost the support of the international community. On Wednesday, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei lent his support to Abadi, the clearest sign yet that Tehran was no longer standing by Maliki."I hope the designation of the new prime minister in Iraq will untie the knot and lead to the establishment of a new government and teach a good lesson to those who aim for sedition in Iraq,” Khamenei said during a meeting, according to a statement on his website.Abadi has won swift endorsements from the United States and Iran as he called on political leaders to end feuds that have allowed Islamist militants to seize a third of Iraq.
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/buffalo-bills-coach-quit-nowhere-182825013.html	Buffalo Bills Coach Who Quit Out Of Nowhere Went Ballistic After The Sammy Watkins Trade	Tom Szczerbowski/Getty ImagesOne of the oddest stories of the NFL offseason is what's going on in Buffalo, where Bills coach Doug Marrone abruptly opted out of his contract after Week 17.Marrone led the Bills to a 9-7 record in 2014, the franchise's first winning season in 10 years. Then he quit.What gives?According to widespread reports, there was growing tension between Marrone and general manger Doug Whaley, and that's why he walked away.Tim Graham of the Buffalo News reports that Marrone's relationship with Whaley " had fallen apart ," and that the coach made one final play for more personnel control before opting out.ESPN's Adam Schefter gives a good example of why Marrone was so frustrated with his lack of personnel power.  According to Schefter, Marrone stormed out of the room after the team made the Sammy Watkins trade during the 2014 draft:Marrone was not in favor of Buffalo surrendering a future first-round pick to the Cleveland Browns in a trade that did not involve a quarterback, sources said.There are different accounts of exactly how unhappy Marrone was, with some sources recalling he stormed out of the room, and other sources simply saying he walked out of the room.The Bills traded the No. 9 pick, a 2015 1st-round pick, and a 2015 4th-round pick to the Cleveland Browns for the No. 4 pick. They drafted Watkins at No. 4, but they paid a heavy price.In retrospect, Marrone was right. The 2014 draft turned out to be one of the best wide receiver drafts ever. If they Bills stayed at No. 9, they could have taken Odell Beckham Jr. (who ultimately had a better season than Watkins) and kept their 2015 1st-rounder.Marrone, who will still get paid the $4 million the Bills owe him in 2015, is now considered a candidate for the New York Jets job.More From Business InsiderThe 32 Best Prospects In The 2015 NFL Draft NFL POWER RANKINGS: Where Every Team Stands Going Into The Playoffs Jerry Jones Agonized For Months Over Not Drafting Johnny Manziel — Now It Looks Like One Of His Smartest Moves Ever

Worldwide, some 75 million people have been infected with it. Around 36 million of them have died.HIV gets its letters from its official name, human immunodeficiency virus, a mutation of simian immunodeficiency virus, which is found in chimpanzees.The researchers believe the virus first jumped to humans through infected blood from bush meat.From there, the virus spread to areas of Africa beyond Kinshasa, and eventually to the world. The report establishes that more than one million people were using Kinshasa's Belgium-backed railways by the end of 1940, contributing to the disease's spread. At that time, Kinshasa was part of the Belgian Congo.
http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2014/11/11/7194717/jim-harbaugh-lie-49ers-reporter-michael-crabtree-conversation	49ers columnist claims Jim Harbaugh fabricated his interaction with Michael Crabtree	A Bay Area columnist is claiming that Jim Harbaugh misrepresented the questions he asked wide receiver Michael Crabtree after Sunday's game.A San Francisco 49ers columnist for the San Jose Mercury News is taking Jim Harbaugh to task for allegedly making up the columnist's side of a conversation with Michael Crabtree. Tim Kawakami of the San Jose Mercury News published a blog post Tuesday questioning Harbaugh's integrity as a result of the reportedly misrepresented exchange.Kawakami and his colleague, Ann Killion, reportedly talked to Crabtree after the 49ers' win over the New Orleans Saints on Sunday, and asked the wide receiver about an important catch he made on fourth-and-10. Kawakami claims that Crabtree then made comments, unprompted by the reporters, that suggested he was dissatisfied with his playing time:"I'm a third-down receiver," Crabtree said. "I mean, I'm like the third option. So I come in and I do my job."When Harbaugh was asked about Crabtree's comments at his Monday press conference, he claimed that the reporters were specifically questioning Crabtree about his lack of playing time:"And again, I just caught the end of it, but what I heard the two reporters asking him was, ‘You don't seem like you're getting the ball as much. Are you not part of the offense? Why aren't you getting the ball? You dropped some balls.' Again, I didn't see the whole thing, but I felt a little defensive for Michael. Here's a guy who makes a great play and now he's answering this question or that question. Maybe I might've gotten a little defensive too."Kawakami wrote that Harbaugh was nearby while he and Killion were talking to Crabtree, but was not standing next to them as they spoke to the wideout. Kawakami reportedly recorded the conversation and offered to play it for the 49ers, but was turned down. He then published the alleged transcript of the 30-second conversation:-Q: Your reception was the moment of the game. -CRABTREE: Third down. I'm a third-down receiver. I mean, I'm like the third option. So I come in and I do my job. -Q: That was fourth down, I think. -CRABTREE: Fourth down. I guess when they need me, you know, I guess that's when I play. I know you all count stats-look that up. -Q: You weren't on the field all the time. -CRABTREE: No, no, no. Do what I'm supposed to do, you know? -Q: Did you see Kaepernick... were you moving-looking with him? At that point, Crabtree grabbed his travel bag and walked out of the locker room, on his way going right past Kaepernick and almost directly into Harbaugh, who tapped him on the chest while Crabtree burst past him.Harbaugh has been the subject of reports over several months detailing a growing rift between him and the 49ers' front office and players. Recently, former San Francisco great Jerry Rice claimed that Harbaugh would be "gone" from the organization after the season, citing the coach's "collegiate mentality" as a reason for discord.Harbaugh has been successful as the 49ers head coach, taking the team to the 2013 Super Bowl and the NFC Championship Game last season. The team is off to a rocky start relative to the 49ers' standards, though a 5-4 record would hardly be a cause for panic elsewhere in the league. Any tension with media likely won't help matters.★★★
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/11/11/us-china-unveil-new-climate-change-goals/20992311/	US, China unveil new climate change goals	BEIJING (AP) - The United States and China pledged Wednesday to take ambitious action to limit greenhouse gases, aiming to inject fresh momentum into the global fight against climate change ahead of make-or-break climate talks next year.President Barack Obama announced that the U.S. would move much faster in cutting its levels of pollution. Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to cap China's emissions in the future - a striking, unprecedented move by a nation that has been reluctant to box itself in on global warming.The unexpected breakthrough by the world's two largest polluters, unveiled on the last day of Obama's trip to China, reflected both nations' desire to display a united front that could blunt arguments from developing countries that have balked at demands that they get serious about global warming. Yet it was unclear how feasible it would be for either country to meet their goals, and Obama's pledge was sure to confront tough opposition from ascendant Republicans in Congress.The U.S. set a new target to reduce its emissions of heat-trapping gases by 26 percent to 28 percent by 2025, compared with 2005 levels. That's a sharp increase from earlier in Obama's presidency, when he pledged to cut emissions by 17 percent by 2020.China, whose emissions are still growing as it builds new coal plants, didn't commit to cut emissions by a specific amount. Rather, Xi set a target for China's emission to peak by 2030, or earlier if possible. He also pledged to increase the share of energy that China will derive from sources other than fossil fuels."This is, in my view, the most important bilateral climate announcement ever," said David Sandalow, formerly a top environmental official at the White House and the Energy Department. "It sends the signal the two largest emitters in the world are working together to address this problem."Obama's target, expected to serve as the U.S. contribution to a worldwide treaty to be finalized next year in Paris, came months before it had been expected. The U.S. has sought to show aggressive action on climate change in order to spur other nations to offer ambitious contributions, too.For China, the commitment to cap emissions marked a turning point in China's evolution on global warming and its responsibility to deal with the problem. China accounts for around 30 percent of global emissions, but has only gotten serious in recent years as the large-scale impact on health and quality of life in China has come into focus, exacerbated by smothering smog in Beijing's skies.Environmental advocates in the U.S. heralded the joint announcements as a game-changer that would undermine opposition. If China can get serious about emissions, they said, surely others can, too."Now there is no longer an excuse for Congress to block action," said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who chairs the Senate's environmental panel.But Republicans signaled that they would seek to thwart Obama's efforts once the GOP controls the Senate next year, pointing out that Obama was saddling future presidents with a tough-to-meet goal."This unrealistic plan, that the president would dump on his successor, would ensure higher utility rates and far fewer jobs," said incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.More stories on AOL.com:
http://news.yahoo.com/slow-decline-fast-food-america-063327142.html	The slow decline of fast food in America	New York (AFP) - The hospitals of the Truman Medical Centers in Kansas City, Missouri no longer serve fast food in their cafeterias, after ending a contract with McDonald's in 2012 -- two years ahead of schedule.In Kentucky, Kosair Children's Hospital signed up to serve Big Macs and Chicken McNuggets to its patients when it opened in 1986. But it has now followed in TMC's footsteps.The reversals by hospital chains that once embraced McDonald's reflect a waning love affair with fast food in the United States, as consumers become increasingly aware of the benefits of eating better."Fast foods have their place, but I am not so sure their place is inside the hospital," recalled John Bluford, the former TMC chief executive."We thought that we needed to change the game a little bit and start creating a culture of health," Bluford told AFP."It was a health-concerned decision and a mission-driven decision, given our mission to improve the health of our community."- Shifting tastes -Sales of McDonald's in the United States fell 3.3 percent in the last quarter. The consumption of sodas fell last year to 1995 levels, according to the industry specialist Beverage Digest.Americans drank on the average 51 gallons (nearly 200 liters) of soda per person in 1998; last year, it was 44 gallons.View gallery A woman eats in a fast food restaurant in a Brooklyn neighborhood on June 11, 2013 in New York City  …The fall is more marked for light sodas, which fell six percent amid concerns sparked by studies suggesting some synthetic sweeteners were carcinogenic."There's a shift away from the perception of food that is mass-produced towards food that is perceived to be more homemade or artisanal or sustainably produced," said Keith-Thomas Ayoob, associate clinical professor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York."Consumers want to feel that they're doing healthier things and eating a healthier diet."More and more Americans are making the link between fast food and sodas, and life-long health problems like obesity and diabetes, said Sriram Madhusoodanan, an organizer of the anti-fast-food campaign "Value [the] Meal" at Corporate Accountability International.Campaigns like theirs are scoring gains against the powerful industry.In December 2011, San Francisco required fast food chains to add more low-sugar, low-salt foods like fruit and vegetables for children.And those campaigns are also showing results.The US Centers for Disease Control said in February that there had been a 43 percent fall in obesity among two- to five-year-olds over the previous decade.View gallery More than one-third of American adults (34.9% or 78.6 million) are obese, according to recent figure …Much more needs to be done, according to the organization Trust for America's Health. More than two-thirds of adult Americans remain overweight, it says.Christopher Gindlesperger, spokesman for the American Beverage Association, downplayed the role sodas play in the health problem.Because of the greater popularity of low-sugar sodas, he said, the amount of sugar consumed from sodas has fallen 40 percent in the last 10 years.Sugar-related diseases "are very serious and very complex," he said."If you look at the government data, you see that calories in the American diet from sodas are just a small piece of the overall (total)... We empower our customers to make the choices that are right for them."- New options -The success of the restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill symbolizes the new face of the American diet.Launched in 1993, Chipotle advertises that it uses hormone-free meat and locally-raised organic vegetables."From the very beginning, Chipotle has used really high-quality fresh ingredients, and prepares all the foods we serve," company spokesman Chris Arnold told AFP."So from the beginning, we were doing something which is pretty different than what was happening in traditional American fast food."Fast food chains are reacting to the new social and market pressure. McDonald's has eliminated some of its controls on franchises to allow them to adapt menus to customers' tastes.Last year, Taco Bell phased out its children's menu. And drink companies like Coca-Cola and Pepsi are expanding their beverage lines with lower-sugar options.McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Pepsi did not respond to requests for comment from AFP.For Madhusoodanan, the real change will come when McDonald's stops tempting children with toys to sell its "Happy Meals"."They are changing, they're coming around because the public is now demanding it. They have to change," said Bluford.

He used a tool called iDos, an open source DOSBox-like app to install the OS. He found that most of it worked fine but he was unable to upgrade to Windows XP. And we can assume he was also able to play Doom.There’s is very little new about this whole process – people have been putting emulators on things since the original VAX machines – but it’s cool to see resurrected software run so readily on new hardware. While I can’t imagine a real world use case for this (maybe you really need to run a copy of Mavis Beacon?) it’s a great theoretical exercise. Who knows, maybe someone can run POSDT next.Here is the poorly translated FAQ:￼1.Q: Can I install WINDOWS XP? A: The answer is yes you can, but certainly not by idos, because idos simply simulate the DOS environment is not the true sense of the virtual machine, so the system is more difficult to run the DOS and idos simulation environment and do not have XP running basic environmental needs, so later if transplanted XP system, then I will make use of their leisure time with friends ios platform to write a plug-in to run XP virtual machine system.2.Q: Why are you doing this? Why not use Remote Desktop. A: First, to show that this kind of thing tall Remote Desktop is currently no support on win98 systems, not to use during system installation and tool methods have sent me here.3.Q: Why is the process I installed the explorer process wrong? A: Because idos simulator only simulates the 16’s dos environment, although win98 16/32 hybrid system but Explorer and exe process large part needed is a 32-bit environment, so when they need 32 program calls some system environment variables and support libraries when an error occurs, LZ modify some of the resource is designed to allow him to run in idos environmental good, However, this modification will change the part of the machine, which has led some device errors when using LZ modify the good image. After LZ according to everyone’s feedback slowly improve!There are full instructions on his post if you can read Chinese. If not, I leave the installation as an exercise for the reader.
http://news.yahoo.com/us-sailors-hit-hood-attack-turkey-173145185.html	US sailors hit by 'hood attack' in Turkey	Istanbul (AFP) - A group of nationalist Turkish youths on Wednesday attacked three visiting US sailors in Istanbul, trying to force sacks on their heads in an assault angrily condemned by the US government.Several dozen members of the nationalist youth group Turkiye Genclik Birligi (Turkish Youth Union/TGB) attacked the sailors in the Eminonu district on the Istanbul waterfront, a popular tourist hub.They sought to force white sacks onto the heads of the sailors, who were in civilian dress, and chased them across the quayside, shouting "Yankee Go Home" and "Down with US Imperialism".The use of hoods was a reference to an incident from the 2003 Iraq war that outraged many in Turkey when US forces in northern Iraq arrested a group of Turkish soldiers, forced hoods on their heads and held them for three days.The incident inflamed nationalist sentiment in Turkey and formed the basis of the smash-hit 2006 film about Turkish agents in Iraq "Valley of the Wolves: Iraq"."We want you to get lost and we are using our right to protest," the group said it told the sailors.View gallery Several dozen members of the nationalist youth group Turkiye Genclik Birligi attacked US sailors in  …According to NTV television, 12 people were subsequently arrested.The sailors were from the USS Ross guided missile destroyer, which was moored in Istanbul after returning from military exercises in the Black Sea, US officials said."We find it ugly and disturbing. We condemn that attack," US military spokesman Colonel Steven Warren told reporters in Washington.The attack was carried out "by what appear to be thugs on the street," he said. "We're working closely with Turkish authorities to have this investigated and get to the bottom of what happened."Liberty for the crew of the USS Ross was cancelled for the remainder of the vessel's stay but the incident appeared to be a "one-off" and would not disrupt "the strong relationship" between Turkey and the United States, he said.In a statement posted on Twitter, the US embassy in Ankara described the footage of the incident, which was posted on social networks, as "appalling"."While we respect the right to peaceful protest and freedom of expression, we condemn today's attack in Istanbul," it said.The embassy said it had "no doubt the vast majority of Turks would join us in rejecting an action that so disrespects Turkey’s reputation for hospitality."Turkey's refusal to cooperate with the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 caused a full-blown crisis in relations between Washington and Ankara.But tension has re-emerged again in recent months over Turkey's wariness of offering full support to the US-led coalition fighting Islamic State (IS) jihadists in Iraq and Syria.US Vice President Joe Biden is expected in Istanbul on November 21 for talks with Turkish leaders in a visit seen as crucial for smoothing out the current tensions.The TGB claims to be staunchly loyal to the principles of modern Turkey's founding father Mustafa Kemal Ataturk and also stanchly opposed the ruling Islamic-rooted party co-founded by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

http://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/norway-intercepted-russias-meanest-combat-jet-for-the-f-1657621776	Norway Intercepted Russia's Meanest Combat Jet For The First Time	A pair of Norwegian F-16s intercepted a Russian flight of mighty Su-34 'Fullback' fighter bombers off the coast of Finnmark this week. It is said that this was the first time that Norway, which shares a border with Russia and is active in surveying their military drills, has intercepted the greatly enhanced deep strike optimized variant of the Su-27 Flanker.Roughly analogous to something between an F-111 and an F-15E Strike Eagle, the Su-34 Fullback is widely regarded as the most advanced tactical jet is Russia's growing arsenal. It pairs the maneuverability and long-range of the Su-27 with a side-by-side enlarged cockpit and the most advanced operational avionics and sensor suite in the Russian Air Force's inventory. From hauling massive supersonic anti-radiation missiles, to escorting itself at low-level deep into enemy territory to strike targets with its on-board laser designator, the Su-34 is a feared asset indeed.It is not clear exactly how many Su-34s were tracked during the Norwegian intercept, but pictures show a single example flying alongside an armed Norwegian Viper. The big charcoal gray Russian attack fighter is seen carrying just a pair of R-73 air-to-air missiles and a huge ventral drop tank.This intercept comes as the European Leadership Network, a European policy and strategy think tank, came out with a startling report regarding Russia's seemingly relentless flights around, and sometimes in, European sovereign airspace. The report states that three recent incidents in particular could have easily escalated into an actual conflict. Additionally its stated that Russia's procedure of flying military flights without turning on its aircraft's transponders or talking to air traffic control could end up in "catastrophe."The Atlanticcouncil.org story on the study states:In March, an SAS civilian airliner taking off from Copenhagen narrowly avoided collision with a Russian spy plane 50km south of the Swedish city of Malmo. The Russian aircraft had turned off its transponders, making it hard for civilian air traffic controllers to track. The airliner, which was carrying 132 passengers, avoided the military jet only because its pilots spotted it in time through the window.The European Leadership Network's study resulted in three recommendations:1. The Russian leadership should urgently re-evaluate the costs and risks of continuing its more assertive military posture, and Western diplomacy should be aimed at persuading Russia to move in this direction.2. All sides should exercise military and political restraint.3. All sides must improve military-to-military communication and transparency.The idea that Russia is taking these large of risks, in some ways seemingly inviting an international incident in which innocent lives could be lost without shots ever being fired, is very unsettling if not downright puzzling.Meanwhile, the western world has been slow to awaken to the fact that their Cold War past may have returned to haunt them, as every unidentified Russian flight is not without great potential risk. In the end, there is only so many 'bold moves' Putin can make before the world has to come to the table and ask some very hard questions, regardless of how horrific the answers may be.Hat tip to our good friend David Cenciotti at TheAviationist.com for initially reporting the Russian Su-34/Norwegian F-16 intercept.Tyler Rogoway is a defense journalist and photographer who maintains the website Foxtrot Alpha for Jalopnik.com You can reach Tyler with story ideas or direct comments regarding this or any other defense topic via the email address Tyler@Jalopnik.com
http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/advisor/mark-cuban-wrong-paid-172936643.html	Mark Cuban Is Wrong. If You Work, You Should Get Paid For It	Mark Cuban Is Wrong. If You Work, You Should Get Paid For It Mark Cuban wants people who will work for free.Donatella Versace and Mark Cuban are the most outspoken advocates for it, but there’s a new trend going on in America: large companies wanting people to work for free.Actually, Versace wants you to pay her.There has been a rise recently in the amount of unpaid internships in America, with desperate job seekers willing to do anything to get hired. Some companies have even come under fire by the US Department of Labor for offering unpaid internships, saying they violate the law.Versace took it further than anyone, actually asking $20,000 for the right to be her intern (in fairness, she said she’d donate the money to charity).Cuban has spoken out against the US Department of Labor’s crackdown on unpaid internships, arguing that if people want to work for free, they should be able to. On his blog, he laid out a project he wanted unpaid and eager people to do for him in 2009, until his HR team told him it wasn’t allowed.“Welcome to the USA of 2009,” Cuban wrote on his blog. “Where the government, both Republicans and Democrats, thinks that doing nothing is a far better alternative than being productive and gaining experience! Where our politicians would rather see you pay out of your pocket to go back to school rather than get valuable on-the-job experience.”Logical case, right?Not really. Just look at the numbers.The NumbersFirst off, it is worth noting that getting a paid internship in college is a very smart idea. The National Association of Colleges and Employers recently did a survey of people who graduated in 2013 with a bachelor’s degree and found that a graduate who did a paid internship while in college made an average starting salary of $51,930 – compared to a $37,087 average salary for workers who didn’t do an internship.But here’s a shocking statistic from that same survey: 2013 graduates who did an unpaid internship while in college actually made less than students who got no internship at all – $35,721 a year, on average, compared to the aforementioned $37,087. Pretty bad deal – work for free and then make $1,366 a year less when it’s time to work for money.On top of that, the stories of unpaid internships are anything but glamorous. For example, one NYU student took an unpaid internship at an animation company, hoping to work in animation. Instead, she was asked to clean the door handles each day so the swine flu wouldn’t spread.Why It Doesn’t WorkFirst off, there are legal issues to unpaid internships. For an unpaid internship to be legal, the internship has to be for the benefit of the intern, the work can’t replace the work of employees and the employer must derive no “immediate advantages” from the activities of the intern.Essentially, what you’re left with is a job-shadowing program or doing a job that has no value. That might have some limited benefit for the intern, but most people are probably better off getting some work experience, as opposed to watching others work for a semester or doing a job that provides no “immediate advantage” to the employer.Cuban is arguing that those rules are stupid, that people should be able to work for free if they want. Putting the legal issues aside, is that really a good idea?Cuban, in his blog, explained he wanted eager people to work for him for free to create content about the Dallas Mavericks, the basketball team he owns. First off, is there really a dearth of sports content on the web?Second, though, if he really wants to do something like that, he should put some “skin in the game” and pay for it. If he doesn’t think it is worth investing in, than why do it? Conversely, if workers are doing something that creates value for the company, why shouldn’t they be paid?And imagine if this took off, if the best way to get jobs at these corporations would be first working for free at them. Think about how discriminatory that process would be – only people with the means to work for free would get an opportunity, a small percentage of the population.OverviewHere’s a rule to live by: if you work, make sure you get paid for it. Because if you’re not getting paid, you are either being taken advantage of or you are doing work that has no real value to the organization.Neither one of those options are good.This push for unpaid workers is bad for employers as well, for the same basic reasons. If you are assigning critical work to unpaid workers, you probably aren’t going to get the quality you want, and you are probably breaking the law.Conversely, if you have people around who are not getting paid and are not contributing anything of value, both parties are probably better off doing something else, as chances are they are actually hampering your organization’s efficiency.Ultimately, it comes down to values. Workers should value themselves enough not to work for free. And employers should value their people enough to know they shouldn’t ask them to.This article was syndicated from Business 2 Community: Mark Cuban Is Wrong.

https://games.yahoo.com/news/dungeons-dragons-booming-online-not-120101320.html	Dungeons & Dragons is booming online, but not in the way you think	When Polygon rolled into this year’s Gen Con in Indianapolis we couldn't find the Dungeons & Dragons booth. Turns out that the nation’s largest tabletop gaming convention — started by Gary Gygax, the father of D&D, himself — didn't have one. But it's not because D&D is falling on hard times. Quite the opposite, says lead designer Mike Mearls. It's because D&D is gaining popularity someplace new — online, through streaming services like Twitch and YouTube."It’s been almost a year since the Player’s Handbook launched, and over a year for the Starter Set," Mearls told Polygon, "and we’re definitely ahead of projections."While he can’t share numbers, suffice it to say that D&D 5e is selling like hotcakes."In fact, we just hit our fourth print run of the Player’s Handbook. For us, that’s a challenge. How do you keep this up? What does that mean for the audience? More people are interested in D&D than we thought. Who are these people? What do they want? How do we keep them around?"It’s a very good set of problems to face."Castles in the cloudWizards of the Coast always has a massive Magic: The Gathering tournament at Gen Con, and this year was no exception. But traditionally they also have big D&D installation, usually bits and pieces of a castle. One year, rumor has it, they even had it manned by archers who would fire into the crowd.This year? Nuthin. There was a sizeable play area, with dozens of tables filled with folks rolling d20s in earnest, but it was manned by a third party contractor."We're not actually with Wizards of the Coast," they told Polygon. "Lemme try and call Mike for you."Must ReadTurns out, Mearls was caught in the crowds."When I think of Gen Con, going back to 1999 and up to today, the board game presence is just far bigger than it ever was," Mearls told Polygon. "Compared to 10-15 years ago, it’s board games now. I’d almost go as far as to say it’s a board game show. That’s probably overselling it."When you think of the typical Gen Con experience for a lot of people, they go to the exhibit hall. The main hall is enormous. You could spend two days there. But when you think about the interaction you can have in the exhibit halls, that’s perfect for board games. Look at the booth for Fantasy Flight or Mayfair. They have all these tables where you can play games. If I want to learn a board game, I can just sit down — especially the way they’re designed now. They're simpler, faster. Some play in one hour.D&D isn't quite so pick-up-and-play, Mearls said. So over the past year he's had to rethink how to reach the most people. In his opinion, Gen Con isn't the best place for that anymore."I’m sure someone will say this is wrong," Mearls said. "I’m sure I missed something, but I didn’t see any RPG companies or publishers pushing an RPG game with tables set up for play in the exhibit hall. People just understand that it is too hard to teach someone those games in 15 or 30 minutes. You’re getting an experience that’s so watered down that it isn’t really helping you become a big fan of it."Not only that, but it can be Sunday of Gen Con, I’m completely enervated, I’m totally out of it, and I can still teach you how to play Ticket to Ride. I can’t run a good RPG."We made a decision a couple of years ago, that we’d rather people not play D&D at all than come in and play with a DM who hadn’t had a chance to read the adventure, who’d run way too many hours of D&D at the show, whose voice was gone, stuff like that."So where is Mearls putting his precious resources, if not on the floor of the nation's largest tabletop gaming convention? On Twitch.Cult of personalityThat's right. The original role-playing experience is moving online at an incredible pace, and Mearls is just trying to keep up."We’re kind of riding a wave of RPGs, tabletop RPGs," Mearls said. "There’s a bit of renaissance taking place. Because we finally now have online tools. Not necessarily virtual tabletops, although those help. But just things like video chat and streaming games on Twitch and YouTube and stuff like that."I think that technology, people are really starting to figure out how to use it beyond just streaming games like Hearthstone or Dota. We see more and more people using that to stream their tabletop sessions. Then you have a group like Geek and Sundry that has their roleplay show on Thursdays. I was watching that last week. It was really cool, as a guy who works on Dungeons & Dragons, to open up my Twitch app on my iPad and see Dungeons & Dragons in the first row.""If you’re a good DM and you think your group’s entertaining, why not try streaming? ... That’s something that’s really interesting to see, how that helps spread tabletop RPGs. And especially Dungeons & Dragons."It's ironic then that just in the past few years Wizards of the Coast effectively gave up on its online tools, which launched with the fourth edition of D&D in 2007. The long-awaited virtual tabletop was licensed to Smiteworks, and is now available on Steam, while the electronic resources for DMs was largely wound down."For us, that was a hard lesson we learned from fourth edition," Mearls said. "We launched those PC resources just in time for tablets and smartphones to become a thing. Then we migrated it online so you could use it on the web. I wasn’t involved with the decision-making process at the time, so I don’t know how we ended up there, but it was like, let’s use Silverlight. That’s the platform we used. Turns out Silverlight doesn’t work on mobile."Let’s not put ourselves in a position of trying to be tech experts and instead figure out where the audience is going."Don't split the partyMore than anything though, the most positive news Mearls has been getting from the D&D community is from the surveys he runs through the WoTC website. He's learning that his players are younger than ever before, which means that D&D is growing in just the right kind of way to build the next generation of role-playing aficionados.And, most importantly Mearls says, people are responding well to how they're publishing content.Must Read"This has been a bit different from what people are used to in the launch of an edition," Mearls said. "We came out with the core rulebooks, one each month for three months, and then we had the campaign at launch, Tyranny of Dragons, levels one through 15. We did Princes of the Apocalypse — again, levels one to 15 — and that was in the spring. Now we’re gearing up with Rage of Demons. The product attached to that is Out of the Abyss — level one to 15 — another campaign."We’ve stayed away from the march of the splat books, the new character classes, new spells, all that stuff. It’s thrown some people for a loop. But what we’ve seen is a very strong response to the game overall. People seem happy with it. That’s always good."It seems like we’re reaching a bigger audience than we have in the past."For the granddaddy of role-playing games, Mearls says that the future is bright."The biggest message I want to get out is this idea that D&D is doing very well, but we’re not resting on our laurels. We see every year as starting over. It’s up to us to win back everybody. We’re never going to assume that if you liked what we did last year, you’ll like what we did next year. That’s a recipe for complacency and complacency is the first step toward undermining all the success we’ve had in the past."More from polygon.com:Deadpool's trailer for the Deadpool trailer is better than most trailers How to stop Windows 10's prying eyes Rare Replay review: in times past Japanese report says Konami is a deeply unhappy workplace Every Gears of War now part of Xbox One remaster thanks to backward compatibility Indiana Jones was an abusive creep (but he was almost much worse) The Tom Cruise backlash never existed

http://www.examiner.com/article/the-voice-three-judges-disappoint-viewers	The Voice:' Three judges disappoint viewers	The incomparable coach on The Voice; Pharrell WilliamsLast night on “The Voice” the top 12 singers were decided based on America’s vote and one safe the judges had from the bottom three in their team. And as far as those saved by America, they were spot on and without doubt it can be said that this country knows what it likes and what it wants to hear on the radio. However, when it came to some of the coach’s decisions to save one performer, a thought came to mind that asked, if the same show was watched last night.First up was Team Blake, whose top five singers performed and they sounded great together, but they were not done yet and then came the time to reveal the three that would continue in the competition, Reagan James and Craig Wayne Boyd, and then Blake Shelton saved Jessie Pitts and thus sent Taylor Brashears home and how could that have happened Taylor’s voice is fascinating, with a performance on Monday that went beyond outstanding; that was a disappointing decision.Next, it was time for Team Pharrell, they performed together and this was also a great number and epitomized the closeness among all these singers who are nevertheless competing against each other, but then it was decision time, first save was Luke Wade and DaNica Shirey, and an outstanding coach’s save when Pharrell said Sugar Joans; great decision by Pharrell and congratulations to his top three singers.And then came Team Gwen with a performance by all five top singers that was fun, entertaining, and memorable, and it should be added that it will remain memorable by the outrageousness that transpired afterwards, first singer saved by America was Taylor John Williams and that was a disappointment, the second save was Anita Antoinette and she has earned her spot for the live rounds, but then Gwen chose to save Ryan over Bryana and that was not right based on Tuesday night’s performance where Bryana rocked the house with a voice that exemplifies what this show is about; that was beyond disappointing.And to close the night Team Adam performed and they all were entertaining with a melodic tune that will remain in the minds of those watching for a long time yet to come, then came decision time and America saved Damien and Matt McAndrew, and another disappointment when Adam saved Chris over two top singers such as Mia Pffirman and Taylor Phelan, once again the question begs to be asked: were we all watching the same performances on Monday night?The voices were there, the stage presence was also there, so why those who sounded best were eliminated is something that will boggle the mind for a long time, it does not take a music genius to recognize who had a better voice than who, and therefore to see those outstanding voices be voted out is unfair, outrageous, and absurd.

http://tv.yahoo.com/news/agents-h-e-l-d-141100372.html	Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. "The Writing On the Wall" Review: A Blueprint for Action	Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. S02E07: "The Writing On the Wall"I can't believe Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. killed my favorite character! A moment of silence for Ward's Beard, please. Knowing its death was coming didn't make it any easier to watch Brett Dalton shave it off and buzz his hair as Ward set out to destroy the brother who'd promised to bring him to justice. R.I.P., Ward's Beard. You were too precious for this world.All joking aside, the honest truth is that I've come to associate the beard with Ward 2.0, the version of the character you don't want to cross, i.e. the sociopath who thinks he's somehow doing good, who believes he can lead Skye to her father, and who doesn't feel remorse or see any error in his ways. In other words, Ward's beard was a physical reminder that the man is capable of killing people in cold blood and skilled enough to quickly and quietly take out a team of Hydra agents and escape before S.H.I.E.L.D. can catch him.Shaving the beard and getting a new 'do is his attempt to don a disguise and return to looking like the deceptively respectable man he was when we first met him. I mean, there was a reason I called him Agent Handsome in most of my Season 1 S.H.I.E.L.D. reviews, so to see that bare face again is a reminder of just how little I liked his character until his true colors showed through. I look forward to having the series erase those bad memories as he hunts down his brother and completes whatever else he has planned now that he's escaped Coulson and the team. This compelling new chapter to his story promises to keep us guessing with regard to his motives now that S.H.I.E.L.D. has (sort of) wrapped up one of its other mysteries, the case of the alien scribbles. And that works just fine because Ward's persona is a bit more exciting this way.The murder of a former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who took part in Project T.A.H.I.T.I. brought the mystery of the writing to the forefront this week, when it was revealed that her cause of death was shock due to the marks being carved into her body while she was still alive. In order to find the murderer—who, as we all suspected, was the the tattooed Brian Van Holt at the end of "A Fractured House"—Coulson had to unlock his own painful memories. This allowed Clark Gregg to play another side of Coulson that we very rarely ever get to see, but who's always been there beneath the surface: the slightly unhinged badass.When Marvel fans think of Phil Coulson, they often think of the calm and goodnatured man who collected Captain America trading cards, but he's also a fearless agent who works for S.H.I.E.L.D., and you don't just rise to his level without also being highly skilled and trained in combat. It was a welcome departure from the buttoned-up Coulson we've come to know. And although it might've felt a bit out-of-character for him to trick Skye and take off after the last remaining T.A.H.I.T.I. patient on his own, the more aspects of Coulson that Gregg and the writers can explore, the better. He's the director of S.H.I.E.L.D. and I expect (hope) to see more of these moments in the future.Of course, the downside to all of this is that Coulson had to return to his own locked-up memories to discover the identities of Sebastian Van Holt and the other agent, which put him at risk because doing so is what makes anyone who's got GH-325 in their system unstable. Even Mack was wondering what kind of crazy shit he'd signed up for after witnessing Coulson relive what was hidden away in his brain.I have to say, I respect Mack more and more with each passing week. Now that Skye's a full-on S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, she's no longer capable of being the audience stand-in, but Mack has slipped into the role with ease. As an outsider, he's able to share his honest opinion of what he observes. He also continues to help FItz in ways that people like Simmons can't, and it now appears likely that he'll eventually be the person to help Fitz recover what Mack refers to as the "missing files" in his brain. Being a member of S.H.I.E.L.D. tends to warp one's idea of normal behavior, and having someone like Mack around to speak up when everyone's acting like a crazy person and taking dangerous risks helps to keep S.H.I.E.L.D. grounded.Now that Coulson and the team know that what everyone's been carving is actually a blueprint for a city, we can put the scribbling storyline behind us and move on to the next chapter—the search for said city. It's a relief to have Coulson's secret out and the entire team in on the plan, because I wasn't very fond of this mysterious map story and I'm eager to see where the show goes next. Hydra is also searching for the city, but thanks to Ward's little present for Coulson, the team now has a Hydra agent locked up in the basement. This should be fun!– Even Bobbi wasn't able to outsmart Ward, but the fact that the team had a backup plan with Hunter is a reminder that even though Ward is highly skilled, he's just one man. Can he outrun them and outsmart them forever?– Oh hi, Triplett, what's up? How are you? I know why you really want to kill Ward, and it's because you're his replacement on the team and he's still getting all the screentime. Sorry, but you're still very boring.– What city will the team be looking for? Thoughts? Theories?– I STILL want to know who all these extras are hanging out in the lab. WHO ARE YOU?– Hunter: "I didn't blow my cover." Bobbi: "Are you suggesting I did?" Hunter: "It's okay, it happens! What did you do? Come on too strong? Subtlety is key!" Bobbi: "You were dressed as a cowboy!"– "Coulson could do better, but then again, I am hard to replace."
http://autos.yahoo.com/news/life-tesla-model-tires-cost-more-fuel-does-122101181.html	Life With Tesla Model S: Tires Cost Me More Than My 'Fuel' Does	2013 Tesla Model S in winter, Hudson Valley, NY [photo: David Noland]I always knew electric cars were cheap to run, but this is ridiculous.After I bought the first set of replacement tires for my 2013 Tesla Model S (at 26,000 miles), I crunched the numbers and came to a startling conclusion: I've spent substantially less per mile for my electric "fuel" than I have for my tires.DON'T MISS: Life With Tesla Model S: At Last, Some Maintenance Needed (New Tires)The tires weren't cheap. The Michelin Primacy MXM4 all-season grand-touring tires set me back $250 apiece, plus mounting and balancing, for a total of  $1,131.Over 26,277 miles, that works out to  4.3 cents per mile. Pretty typical for a high-performance luxury sedan. Cost of electricityOver those same 26,277 miles, I used a total of 8,531 kilowatt-hours of electricity.But, thanks to Tesla's network of free high-power Superchargers, I didn't pay for all of it.2013 Tesla Model S at Supercharger station on NY-to-FL road trip [photo: David Noland]As best as I can figure, I drove about 5,500 Supercharged miles during that time, including a 2,500-mile round-trip to Florida from my home in New York's Hudson Valley.That means I probably sucked up around 1,800 free kWh from the Superchargers.ALSO SEE: Life With Tesla Model S: Three Days Of Service Nirvana (Sep 2013)So let's say I paid for 6,700 kWh.My local utility, Central Hudson, charges about 14 cents per kWh. (Unfortunately, it offers no special night-time or electric car rates.) So, let's do the math: 6,700 kWh x 14 cents/kWh = $938.Onsite service by Tesla Motor technicians on 2013 Tesla Model S, upstate NY [photo: David Noland]Divide by 26,277, and my total "fuel" cost per mile works out to  a remarkable 3.6 cents per mile.That's 20 percent less than the per-mile cost of the tires that carried me on all those miles. Tire costs varyNot every Model S owner will have the same numbers, of course.It's possible to spend a lot more--or less--on both the tires and the electricity.MORE: Life With Tesla Model S: Battery Upgrade From 60 kWh To 85 kWh (Dec 2013)For example, I could have bought Goodyear Eagles and saved $200, reducing my tire costs to 3.5 cents per mile.On the other hand, Model S owners with the optional 21-inch rims can spend as much as $500 for each high-performance tire replacement--and expect to get only 15,000 miles out of a set. That  pushes tire costs above 15 cents per mile.2013 Tesla Model S in Florida, during New York to Florida road trip [photo: David Noland](The upside for  Model S owners with 21-inch rims and high-performance tires: At least they can brag that their fuel cost is only one-fifth of their tire costs.)...And so does electricityElectric rates can vary even more widely than tire expenses.At the national average rate of 11 cents per kWh, my "fuel" cost would have been a mere 2.6 cents per mile.And many utilities offer special night-time rates of 5 or 6 cents per kWh, which would have brought my cost down to 1.3 cents/mile.2013 Tesla Model S in Florida, during New York to Florida road trip [photo: David Noland]But as far as I know, nobody's got a sweeter deal than my buddy Bob Meyer, a Model S owner who lives in Indianapolis, Indiana.That city--my hometown, as it happens--turns out to be a hotbed of forward thinking when it comes to electric cars.RELATED: Does The Tesla Model S Electric Car Pollute More Than An SUV?The local utility, Indianapolis Power and Light, has a special electric-car-only rate for off-peak charging. It's a a mind-bogglingly low 2.3 cents per kWh.So it costs Bob $1.95  to recharge his Model S battery completely and then drive 265 miles. His "fuel" cost amounts to three-quarters of a penny--that's three farthings--per mile.And that doesn't even account for any free Supercharged miles.Cheaper than tires?Heck, in Indy in the winter time, that's probably cheaper than the per-mile cost of Bob's windshield-washer fluid._______________________________________________Follow GreenCarReports on Facebook, Twitter, and Google+.
http://www.redbookmag.com/life/news/a19647/teens-go-on-a-school-trip-come-home-pregnant/	7 Teens Go on a School Trip, Come Home Pregnant	Share Tweet PinTwenty eight Bosnian teenagers, ages 13 through 15, went on a five-day school trip  to Sarajevo, and a quarter of them came home pregnant, the Daily News reports. And no, this wasn't a pregnancy pact. Their parents are livid that the trip wasn't better supervised, according to the Courier Mail. But Nenad Babici, the national coordinator for reproductive health of the Republika Srpska, says that the chaperons are not to blame for their daughters' dalliances. Babci says that parents need to start teaching their children about sex so that they understand the consequences. Sarajevo-based gynecologist Senad Mehmedbasic agrees. "We have to be more direct in the educational system. It must not be allowed that the street teaches children about intimate matters, and that they are later slapped by life," he told Inserbia.info.The story provoked discussions about sex education in Bosnia where they've seen a major spike in the number of sexually active girls between 13 and 15, according to the International Business Times.[Via Daily News]
http://nation.foxnews.com/2014/10/13/kristen-stewart-trashes-military-defends-911-terrorists-camp-x-ray-interview	Kristen Stewart Trashes the Military, Defends 9/11 Terrorists in 'Camp X-Ray' Interview	By Kelli Serio, Breitbart.comDuring an interview with The Daily Beast, actress Kristen Stewart indicated that terrorists at Guantanamo Bay are misunderstood and that joining the United States Armed Forces is the job of a simpleton.Camp X-Ray is Stewart's newest film that illustrates the life of a "simple" female soldier who receives orders as a prison guard to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.Surrounded by jihadists, she bears witness to the apparent cruelty in which they live and befriends a suspected terrorist. She then questions her role in the U.S. military."All she want's to think is 'They did 9/11, they’re bad, f*ck that, I’m going to do my job and I’m going to do it well,' But then she gets down there and just can’t accept it; she can’t conform to that," she said.Protagonist Amy Cole enlisted in the Army as an act of patriotism in the wake of 9/11. Stewart seemingly finds the standards of intelligence for joining the armed forces rather low."She’s simple, not very smart, and really socially inadequate—but a good person. So, if you can sign up, put a uniform on, and erase yourself, you don’t have to consider yourself anymore," she said.

http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/simply-put-the-no-fail-policy-may-have-failed-what-now/	In schools, the no-fail policy may have failed. What now?	The no-detention policy in classes was implemented as part of the Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE) under the RTE Act (Express photo)What is the no-detention policy? No student up to Class VIII can be detained or failed. All students up to Class VIII are automatically promoted to the next class.What is the Class X Board exams policy? Exams are optional for all CBSE students. They have the option of choosing between school-based exams and Board-based ones. Those opting for the former appear for the exams in their own school; those choosing the latter go to an allotted centre. Answersheets of Board-conducted exams are centrally evaluated at designated centres; those of school-based examinees are checked by teachers of the school. Students who opt for school-based exams can be at a disadvantage if changing schools for Class XI.When were these implemented? Why? The no-detention policy was implemented as part of the Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE) under the RTE Act in 2010 to ensure holistic development of students. The idea was also to reduce dropout rates. Several states already had no-detention policies. Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation emphasises on evaluating a child through the year, and not just based on performance in one or two term exams. HRD Minister Kapil Sibal had made Board exams optional in 2011 to cut stress.Also read: ‘Broad consensus’ on scrapping no-detention policy, says Central Advisory Board of EducationWhat is wrong with the no-fail policy? A section of teachers and parents have complained that this policy has led to students developing a lackadaisical attitude, with there being no risk of failing. They also say this system makes no distinction between good and bad students, and between those who work hard and those who don’t. Some states have demanded revocation of the policy, claiming this has led to a sharp fall in learning outcomes and academic levels.What has been the official view? A sub-committee of the Central Advisory Board of Education on no-detention was constituted in 2012 under then Haryana Education Minister Geeta Bhukkal. The committee pitched for the return of detention in a phased manner. “We need to stop, re-assess and then move forward. At this stage, it would be prudent to reiterate the need for assessment of the learning outcomes, and make it consequential by linking it to promotion or otherwise to the next class beyond grade 5,” the committee said in its report.The committee argued that this had led to a decline in learning outcomes. “Rather, the LLOs (Learning Level Outcomes) have steeply come down right from the academic sessions 2010-11 to 2013-14. The declining LLOs clearly reflect that there is something drastically wrong with the policy and system, which need to be remedied,” it said.What is the HRD Ministry’s stand? At a meeting of CABE — the top body advising the government on education — chaired by HRD Minister Smriti Irani on Wednesday, a broad consensus on scrapping the no-detention policy emerged. There was also a pitch for bringing back the Class X exams. The Ministry has asked all states to give their views within 15 days, following which the process of making changes may begin.How can these policies be reversed? Revoking the no-detention policy will require an amendment to the RTE Act. The Class X Board examination can be re-introduced through an executive order.

"I had so much experience with acting and singing and dancing. It was a great experience for a lot of people. It really motivated me to go forth and go for what I wanted."The birthday girl added that the show was clearly a vehicle for several of her peers, too, recalling the exact moment when she realized how many stars emerged for the Disney series."I was at a Teen People party like six months ago," she said, "there was Keri Russell, people from *NSYNC, Christina Aguilera... it was like a big Mickey Mouse Club reunion!"PHOTOS: Stars Who Have Posed Nude While PregnantBritney also went out of her way to explain that the spotlight didn't alter the Kentwood, La. raised starlet."When I go on stage I'm a different person, like I totally explode and I have attitude," she shared. "But, when I come off the stage, I'm just like this entertainment business has not affected me really at all.

You need to go out and do stuff, like, that you know is really, really important. I think coming from a really small town has really grounded me, you know?

Clearly identify on each container what it contains — yard waste, trash, recyclables — so refuse and recycling crews can easily and quickly remove their contents.2. Consider marking the home address on cans to prevent loss. The city is not responsible for damaged or missing trash containers.3. Don’t mix items in the cans, as the city cannot accept or dispose of mixed content, and place concrete at the curb for disposal (not in trash cans).4. The city provides blue recycling bins upon request to city residents who receive recycling service from the city government. Request a recycling bin at RefuseRecycling@fairfaxva.gov or call 703-385-7837.Patch file photo
http://www.sltrib.com/opinion/1891005-155/robinson-holding-an-entire-community-in	Robinson: Holding an entire community in contempt	This was apparent from the beginning. On Aug. 9, Wilson was in his patrol car when he saw Brown and Dorian Johnson walking in the street. Wilson’s account of what he said to them — "Why don’t you guys walk on the sidewalk?" — went unchallenged at the grand jury hearing. In context, Johnson’s version of what Wilson said sounds more credible to me: "Get the [expletive] on the sidewalk."SEE ALSO: Killings by Utah police outpacing gang, drug, child-abuse homicidesWhatever words were spoken, a struggle between Wilson and Brown ensued, with Wilson still inside the car. At one point, Wilson said he tried to hold Brown’s arm. "The only way I can describe it is I felt like a 5-year-old holding on to Hulk Hogan. ... That’s just how big he felt and how small I felt just from grasping his arm," Wilson testified. At another point in the encounter, Wilson said, Brown looked like a "demon."Brown was about 6-feet-4 and weighed nearly 300 pounds — a large man, to be sure, but human, not demonic. Wilson is also about 6-feet-4 and reportedly weighs 210. I’m not aware of many 5-year-olds that size.Wilson described a fight through the car window in which he was punched twice in the face. Grand jurors examined photographs of Wilson taken later at a hospital, and transcripts show they had difficulty making out the facial bruises and swelling he reported suffering. No matter; the prosecutor seemed satisfied that Wilson had come up against a hulking giant who, though unarmed, posed a mortal threat.In the disturbances that closely followed Brown’s death, police responded with tear gas, armored vehicles and an array of military-style equipment more suitable for crowd control in a war zone than in an American suburb. This made sense only if Ferguson was seen not as a community to be policed but as a place to be contained and controlled.Citizens — because that’s what the people of Ferguson are, not subjects — reacted with anger. Officials promised afterward that they had learned a lesson and would not repeat the mistake. Instead, they made new ones.The way McCulloch conducted the grand jury probe was anything but ordinary. Evidence is usually presented in the light most favorable to the prosecution; the idea is to seek an indictment and then figure out guilt or innocence later at trial. McCulloch presented both sides of the case in great detail, essentially asking grand jurors — not trial jurors — to be adjudicators of the facts. He put Brown on trial, not Wilson.In his rambling, self-justifying news conference announcing the no-indictment decision, McCulloch made clear that he believed the eyewitnesses who supported Wilson’s version of events and disbelieved those who did not. Moreover, he questioned the motives of those who disputed Wilson’s story, as if they could not be relied on to participate in an honest search for the truth.Wilson had nearly four hours to tell his story to the grand jury. Would his account have withstood vigorous cross-examination? Would he even have taken the stand at a trial? We will never know.Gov. Jay Nixon made a great show beforehand of declaring a state of emergency that would allow him to call in greater resources to guarantee public safety. Both the in-your-face tone and bizarre timing of McCulloch’s announcement — what court does business at 8 p.m.? — were needlessly provocative. Police were deployed in a way that seemed more suited to containing a riot rather than preventing one.By no means would I ever seek to excuse the arson, looting and senseless destruction that took place Monday night. But policing is something that should be done with a community, not to it. Officials were treating the people of Ferguson like a rabble long before the first police car was torched.eugenerobinson@washpost.com
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/11/18/obama-west-africa-not-out-of-the-woods-on-ebola/20995521/	Obama: West Africa not out of the woods on Ebola	WASHINGTON (AP) - President Barack Obama said Tuesday that West Africa is "nowhere near out of the woods" in its fight against Ebola despite some improvement in the three countries hardest hit by the virus. Obama said the disease remains a threat to the world, including the U.S., and he urged Congress to quickly approve his request for billions of dollars in emergency spending to combat the spread of Ebola at home and abroad.Meeting at the White House with his Ebola response team, Obama also offered condolences to the family of Dr. Martin Salia. The surgeon contracted Ebola in his native Sierra Leone but died Monday at a Nebraska hospital after being rushed there over the weekend for specialized treatment.Sierra Leone is one of the three affected countries along with Liberia and Guinea.Obama said it's important to "continue to push forward until we stamp out this disease entirely in that region. Until we do, there are threats of additional outbreaks and, given the nature of international travel, it means that everybody has some measure of risk.""We are nowhere near out of the woods yet in West Africa," Obama said.He reviewed improvements to the U.S. public health system that were made as a result of Ebola and noted that the eight Ebola-infected people who received prompt medical treatment at American medical facilities are "Ebola free and back with their families."But he bemoaned a decline in U.S. media coverage of the crisis and suggested that it was leading to a sense of complacency."Although we should feel optimistic about our capacity to solve the Ebola crisis, we cannot be complacent simply because the news attention on it has waned," Obama said. "We have to stay with it."He urged Congress to approve his request for $6.2 billion in emergency spending to confront the Ebola outbreak at its source in West Africa and to protect the U.S. against any possible spread before lawmakers conclude their legislative business for the year.Obama said the money would be used bolster the domestic public health system, support ongoing efforts in West Africa, speed testing and approval of Ebola vaccines and treatments, and help other vulnerable countries better respond to communicable disease.

Doctors, initially fearing that it could be cancerous, told the former View co-host that it had to be removed by month's end. Later, the tumor was determined as not cancerous."I had a scary week when we didn’t know what the results were," Hasselbeck said. "But I'm okay…everything came back okay. Surgery’s not fun, but it is necessary to find out if you have something really terrible."PHOTOS: Stars who beat cancerThe TV personality then expressed gratitude to those who supported her before and after the procedure. "I could not be more thankful for my family and my friends who've stuck by me with incredible support," she said. "And really, starting from the top down here, [Fox News CEO] Mr. [Roger] Ailes, and this entire Fox family treated me like family the entire way… I'm certainly not a person who takes a lot for granted, but I certainly don't take it for granted now."PHOTOS: Talk show controversies and feudsHasselbeck got emotional as she discussed the ordeal with her co-host Steve Doocy, even holding his hand as she shared her remarks. "So many people I know have stared down the barrel of that cancer gun, and looked at it when they have gotten bad news," she said, "and have done remarkable things, courageously, to fight it." Watch clips of Elisabeth's emotional return.PHOTOS: Celebs and their political affiliationsTo mark her return as well as Hasselbeck's self-proclaimed "clear and clean bill of health," Doocy and Eric Bolling (who was in for Brian Kilmeade) then caked her with a confection which Doocy said was from Cake Boss."Thank you Cake Boss!" Hasselbeck quipped, while Bolling sniped: "Wherever you are." (As reported Thursday, Nov. 13, TLC pastry wiz Buddy Valastro was arrested for drunk driving.)
http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/07/10/diet-soda-health-problems/2507219/	Study: Diet soda doesn't help you lose weight	Purdue study finds diet soda may be linked to health problems from obesity to diabetes to heart disease.Diet soda, it turns out, may not be the panacea for weight loss that we all thought — and many of us hoped — it was.In fact, a Purdue University study has found that diet sodas may be linked to a number of health problems from obesity to diabetes to heart disease, just like their more sugary counterparts.Susie Swithers, a professor of psychological sciences and a behavioral neuroscientist, reviewed a number of recent studies looking at whether drinking diet soft drinks over the long-term increases the likelihood that a person will overeat, gain weight and then develop other health problems.One large study found that people who drank artificially sweetened soda were more likely to experience weight gain than those who drank non-diet soda. Others found those who drank diet soda had twice the risk of developing metabolic syndrome, often a precursor to cardiovascular disease, than those who abstained.Surprisingly, some of the studies suggested diet soda may be just as bad for our health as non-diet."Are diet sodas worse for you than regular sodas? I think that's the wrong question," said Swithers, who is also a member of Purdue's Ingestive Behavior Research Center. "It's, 'What good are sodas for you in the first place?' "The studies included drinks containing aspartame, sucralose and saccharin. About 30 percent of American adults regularly consume these sweeteners.While research indicating that diet soda might not be a health food has been around a few decades, in the past 25 years, Americans' consumption of these drinks have skyrocketed, among a proliferation of options and concerns over obesity.Such thinking has driven many schools and hospitals to stop offering sugary sodas in their cafeterias and vending machines in an effort to improve the health of their patrons.But research, such as that done by Swithers, suggests that tactic could backfire and that there could be serious long-term health consequences to regular consumption of diet sodas.In scientific terms, Swithers' piece is a review study, one that looks at many different studies to reach a conclusion.The American Beverage Association, the trade association for the non-alcoholic drinks industry, described it a different way."This is an opinion piece not a scientific study," the organization said in an emailed statement. "Low-calorie sweeteners are some of the most studied and reviewed ingredients in the food supply today. They are a safe and an effective tool in weight loss and weight management, according to decades of scientific research and regulatory agencies around the globe."Many organizations, including the American Diabetes Associationand the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, support the use of low- and no-calorie sweeteners to help maintain a healthy weight, the trade industry statement pointed out. In addition, it cited a number of studies that showed that drinking diet beverages will not lead to weight gain or increase a person's desire for sweet foods.Swithers, whose laboratory research is funded by the National Institutes of Health, disputes that. Her paper appears in Wednesday's issue of the journal "Trends in Endocrinology & Metabolism."Some studies have shown that when people drink diet soda, they engage in what's known as "cognitive distortion," deciding that since they saved on liquid calories they can splurge elsewhere — the "diet coke and fries" order.However, something else may be going on. Studies in animals note a link between consuming artificial sweeteners and overeating that leads to weight gain, said Swithers, whose own research relies on animal models. Somehow artificial sweeteners throw off the body's ability to know how many calories it needs."We think there's a much more basic fundamental learning process that's getting interrupted," she said.Normally when someone consumes something sweet, the body expects calories and sugar to follow. But when a person drinks diet soda the payoff never arrives."You get this kind of confusion and that can lead to overeating, and at least in the animal model that can lead to an increase in blood sugar spikes," Swithers said.Of course, diet sodas are not the only places that artificial sweeteners creep into our diets. Some yogurts and baked goods incorporate the no-cal sweet stuff.Still, there's enough data on diet soda here, she added, for people to act."The take-home message is for people to be much mindful of how much sweetener, whether artificial or sugar, they're actually consuming," she said. "We're talking about a health issue here. We're not talking necessarily just about weight gain or weight loss. ... Science suggests that people who drink soda regularly end up with worse outcomes."Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/12ncxjy

http://www.aol.com/article/2014/12/09/plane-nearly-stalled-before-crash-that-killed-6/21005285/	Plane nearly stalled before crash that killed 6	WASHINGTON (AP) - A business jet that crashed in a neighborhood near an airport in suburban Washington, killing all three people on board and a mother and her two young sons on the ground, had slowed to the point where it nearly stalled in midair before impact, federal investigators said Tuesday.Meanwhile, the father of the two young boys who were killed along with their mother said his family had suffered an indescribable loss. The crash sparked a fireball that gutted the family's home in Gaithersburg, Maryland, and police said Marie Gemmell died while trying to protect her sons, 3-year-old Cole and 1-month-old Devin, from the smoke and flames."No words can describe the enormity of our loss and sadness," Ken Gemmell said in statement emailed to The Associated Press. "We lost Marie, the love of my life and college sweetheart, and our two young, innocent and joyful sons - a loss that no person should ever endure."Gemmell and the couple's daughter, Arabelle, were not home at the time of the crash. He asked for privacy while they grieve and try to rebuild their lives.Shortly before impact, the plane had slowed to just over 100 mph, and its computers began sounding an alarm about an impending aerodynamic stall, National Transportation Safety Board member Robert Sumwalt said Tuesday after a preliminary review of the plane's flight data recorder.Sumwalt said he had not listened to the cockpit voice recorder personally and did not summarize anything the pilot said before the crash. According to the data recorder and witnesses interviewed by the NTSB, the plane pitched and rolled severely in the seconds before the crash, he said. There was no indication from the data recorder that the plane had engine trouble.There were also no reports of birds near the plane, Sumwalt said. Another pilot at the Montgomery County Airpark had reported birds standing on the runway just seconds before the crash.All three people on board the plane were from North Carolina and worked in the health care field, including the pilot, 66-year-old Dr. Michael Rosenberg, who had also been involved in a minor crash at the same airport in 2010, officials said.Police tentatively identified the other people aboard the plane as David Hartman, 52, and Chijioke Ogbuka, 31. Hartman worked for a clinical pharmacology consulting firm, Nuventra Pharma Sciences, and its CEO said in a statement that the company was deeply saddened by the loss. Rosenberg was the founder and CEO of a company called Health Decisions, and the company said in a statement Tuesday that Ogbuka also worked there.In 911 calls released by authorities overnight, shock and alarm is evident in the callers' voices."I just saw a jet hit a house! The house is on fire," one man said. "When he came in on final (approach), it flamed out and he went straight down into that house."Two other houses were damaged in the crash, but they were empty and no one else was hurt.Montgomery County Executive Isiah Leggett said Tuesday that the county would review policies and procedures at the airport, including the paths of approach to the runways."When you have an incident like this, it calls into question the safety," Leggett said during an appearance on NewsChannel 8, a local cable channel. "We certainly owe it to the community to go back and check and evaluate, and we will do that."Including Monday's crash, there have been 30 accidents at the airport in the past 31 years, according to NTSB records. Before Monday, the most recent fatal crash was in 1990, and most of the recent crashes involved minor or no injuries.Steve Hedges, a spokesman for the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association and a pilot who knows the Gaithersburg airport well, said many of the recent incidents would be better characterized as hard landings, and some occurred during flight instruction."That's not unusual in an instructional environment. Things happen when people are learning how to fly," Hedges said Tuesday. "I think it's a very safe airport, actually."The previous crash involving Rosenberg occurred in 2010 and involved a different plane that began to drift after it landed. The plane briefly became airborne again before crashing into the runway. Asked whether he was hurt, Rosenberg said, "only his pride," according to NTSB documents.___In the headline of a previous version of this story, it incorrectly said the plane stalled. The NTSB says the plane nearly stalled.More from AOL.com Officials release new Michael Brown autopsy NFL star Cam Newton injured in car accident

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/wires/2009/10/21/jesse-williams-heats-up-g_ws_329420.html	Jesse Williams Heats Up 'Grey's Anatomy'	We nearly swooned in our seats when we heard Jesse Williams, the hottie from "Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants" was added to "Grey's Anatomy" roster of eye candy. And we're sure he won't disappoint as the smoldering Dr. James Avery. ESSENCE.com knew you'd want to know more about the Chicago-bred actor, so we caught up with him on the Los Angeles set of the hit show. ESSENCE.COM: Tell us more about your character, Dr. Avery. What can we expect from him this season? JESSE WILLIAMS: He's one of a few new doctors who are coming into the hospital as part of a merger. It's a tenuous situation since we're all thrown together at a time when everybody is really scared for their job. Avery is a confident, successful surgeon who is really ambitious. He doesn't take sides or deal with any drama. He's there to work and not really get involved in the pettiness. ESSENCE.COM: Sounds like a strong alpha-male type? How different are you from your character? WILLIAMS: He's more cavalier than I am, and probably a little bolder too, but there are some similarities. I also don't also get involved with drama.ESSENCE.COM: I read where you compared auditioning to going on five blind dates in a week and getting dumped after every one. Was your audition for the show that rough? WILLIAMS: This audition was a short, simple process. I got the audition information at 7 P.M. on my birthday (August 5), then went in the next morning and read for it even though I didn't know what part I was reading for. Five days later, I heard I got the job. ESSENCE.COM: What did you do before you got into acting? WILLIAMS: I started modeling when I was in college at Temple University. My first campaign was for Kenneth Cole. After college, I became a teacher in Philadelphia. I taught English and history to high schoolers mostly, but I also taught junior high, first grade, and kindergarten. I tutored on weekends at a local church. That was the most meaningful job I ever had. ESSENCE.COM: We like to watch you on the big and small screens, but what do you like to watch? WILLIAMS: I don't know that I rewatch a lot of films, but "Do the Right Thing" is a great American movie. I like anything on HBO and "Deadwood" was my favorite series. ESSENCE.COM: Weren't you up for the part of Meadow's boyfriend on "The Sopranos"? WILLIAMS: That was my first real TV audition for a real, legit job. I tested for the part, but obviously the other guy got it. He was a Broadway actor and I was a dred from Philly with hair down my back. It worked out for the best. They would have wanted me to cut my hair for the part.For more of Jesse Williams, tune in to ABC's "Grey's Anatomy" on Thursdays at 9 P.M. ET.Read the whole story at Essence
http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2014/04/29/star-wars-rebels-trailer-first-look/8462295/	Sircar's Sabine vs. Empire in 'Star Wars Rebels'	First trailer of upcoming animated series arrives Sunday just in time for Star Wars Day.Part of Tiya Sircar's induction into the Star Wars family was walking a red carpet with Imperial Stormtroopers.But at least her arrival to this past weekend's Radio Disney Music Awards was in cosmic style."I had never seen a Stormtrooper in real life. They were lovely," says Sircar, the actress who voices the Mandalorian explosives expert Sabine in the upcoming animated series Star Wars Rebels.In honor of Star Wars Day on May 4, the first Rebels trailer premieres early Sunday morning (3:01 a.m. ET/12:01 PT) on various websites including StarWars.com and Disney.com, and will also air during Disney XD's LEGO animated special Star Wars: The New Yoda Chronicles on Sunday night (7 ET/PT).The footage can be seen ABC, ABC Family, Fusion, ESPN, ESPN2 and ESPN3 at varying times throughout Sunday, and will also debut on Disney XD and Disney Channel in Europe, Middle East, Africa, Southeast Asia, Latin America and Australia.ABC's Good Morning America will air a 30-second sneak peek at the trailer for Rebels, which is slated to debut as a one-hour special this fall on Disney Channel with an animated series to follow on Disney XD.Set before the events of the original 1977 Star Wars movie and after Star Wars: Episode III — Revenge of the Sith, Rebels follows the crew of the Ghost as they avoid the increasing power of the galactic Empire and the evil Imperial Inquisitor.In addition to Sabine, the group includes cowboy Jedi Kanan Jarrus (Freddie Prinze Jr.), teenage con artist Ezra Bridger (Taylor Gray), the brutish alien Zeb Orrelios (Steve Blum), Twi'lek pilot Hera Syndulla (Vanessa Marshall) and grumpy droid Chopper.Of these fledging members of a nascent Rebel Alliance, Sabine may be the most rebellious: Anti-establishment to her core, she has combat experience but is also an artist, tagging Imperial targets with signature graffiti to let Darth Vader and the Empire know just who attacked them."I love her. She does everything with flair," Sircar says. "When she's blowing stuff up, she's doing it artfully."Each of the main characters have a powerful reason to be fighting "The Man," she adds. "Sabine's, I can't wait for people to find out why she's part of this Rebel crew. It's serious stuff."While the original Star Wars movies Sircar grew up with offered Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia as the primary female role model, she says she's glad youngsters have "two kick-butt kind of girl characters. I hope fans are really going to get on board with them.Sircar has found that folks are especially interested in Sabine, due her being an intriguing warrior but also because of her Mandalorian heritage."She's a chick Mandalorian, so that makes it more interesting, and everyone's very familiar with Boba Fett," Sircar says.Sabine also has a great backstory, though Sircar can't reveal anything about that yet. In addition to hanging around with Stormtroopers, she's also been trained in the ways of keeping secrets — a Star Wars tradition.To get prepped for the role, Sircar's immersed herself in George Lucas' universe after having grown up with the first film trilogy.So, on a scale of 1 to 10, how much of a Star Wars nerd is she? "Now? 11," Sircar says with a laugh. "Vanessa and Freddie, they know everything. I would dare say they know almost as much as (Rebels executive producer) Dave Filoni does, and Dave Filoni is the encyclopedia on Star Wars everything."Our very first (recording) session, those three went on and on. I was impressed and also intimidated. Literally I was like, 'I need to up my game here.' I'm getting there, and I fully realize why people are crazy about it."Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1iE5DP4
http://www.businessinsider.com/russian-media-moscow-has-nuclear-surprise-2014-11	Pro-Kremlin Russian Media Says Moscow Has A 'Nuclear Surprise' For NATO	Desmond Boylan/ReutersA Soviet nuclear missile.The Russian Pravda has published an article titled "Russia Prepares Nuclear Surprise For NATO," citing a Sept. 1 US State Department report that signaled US and Russia had reached parity in terms of deployed strategic nuclear weapons. Although the article does not explicitly contain threats against NATO or the US, the message of the article is clear: The readily deployable Russian nuclear arsenal is growing and now matches that of the US.  From Pravda: It just so happens that today, Russia's strategic nuclear forces (SNF) are even more advanced in comparison with those of the US, as they ensure parity on warheads with a significantly smaller number of carriers of strategic nuclear weapons. This gap between Russia and the United States may only grow in the future, given the fact that Russian defense officials promised to rearm Russia's SNF with new generation missiles.In a September report, followed by an October fact sheet, the US Bureau of Arms Control echoes Pravda's claims.Although the US vastly leads Russia in the deployment of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and enjoys an advantage in deployed heavy bombers of 794 to 528, the US and Russia are roughly equal on the actual number of nuclear warheads deployed aboard ICBMs and heavy bombers. The numbers are almost identical: 1,642 to 1,643.Since February 2011, both the US and Russia have increased their number of deployed strategic nuclear weapons. However, Russia has increased its deployment significantly more than the US has. As of October, Russia had deployed an additional 131 warheads since 2011.This increase in deployed nuclear weapons is despite the signing of New START, which Russia and the US agreed to in February 2011. According to the treaty, both sides were to be limited to 700 deployed ICBMS, submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and heavy bombers along with 1,550 total deployed nuclear warheads on those platforms.Both the US and Russia have more deployed nuclear weapons than the end-state of the treaty envisions. However, there is concern regarding both the number of new warheads Russia is deploying along with various threats from Moscow relating to its nuclear capabilities. In March, for instance, a prominent Russian broadcaster warned that Russia could turn the US into "radioactive dust." Russia has also taken an increasingly bellicose stance toward the West since March. Since then, Russia has had 40 alarmingly close military encounters with NATO or neighboring militaries, including the simulated attack of a heavily populated Danish island by an armed fighter jet.

http://www.voanews.com/content/tunisia-set-for-parliamentary-elections/2496435.html	Tunisia Holds Parliamentary Elections	Tunisians are voting Sunday in parliamentary elections seen as pivotal to establishing democracy in the cradle of the Arab Spring uprisings. Tunisia was the first North African country to topple its government in a popular uprising in 2010 and has been relatively peaceful since.This parliament will be the first permanent National Assembly since Tunisia's historic 2011 revolution, an event that inspired similar popular uprisings across the Arab world. Presidential elections follow next month.While the so-called Arab Spring has led to chaos and bloodshed in some countries, Tunisia's fragile democracy remains a beacon of hope. But the North African country remains dogged by massive economic and security problems – issues that top the agenda for most Tunisian voters.Tunisians heading to the polls Sunday face a bewildering array of choices. No fewer than 13,000 candidates from about 100 different parties are competing for the 217 parliamentary seats.The huge electoral offer was also on display in 2011. That was the year  Tunisia's revolution booted out dictator Zine el Abidine Ben Ali and sparked similar uprisings across the Arab world. Tunisia's first free and fair elections later that year inspired joy and pride. Many people voted for the first time in their lives.Major issue is jobsThe mood on the streets is very different today. Speaking from the capital, Tunis, political analyst Hamadi Redissi said that for many Tunisians, the elections boil down to one issue."Jobs, jobs, jobs. Creating jobs. Nobody is wiling to invest in this country – neither the Tunisians themselves nor the foreigners. And then, security and property and things like this. But jobs is the bottom line of all expectations," Redissi said.Tunisia's economy has suffered since the revolution. Investments have plummeted and its vital tourism industry is struggling. Nationally, unemployment is about 15 percent, and much higher in some areas. Analysts say the economy needs to grow 5 percent yearly to turn Tunisia around. The government expects growth this year to be about half that amount.Overall, there's a sense of disillusionment, said Anthony Dworkin, a Tunisia analyst and foreign policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations."Opinion polls consistently show that large numbers of Tunisians are disappointed with what democracy has brought them so far ... but we haven't reached the critical stage yet. We haven't reached the point where the country wants to turn its back on the transition," he said.Security concernsTunisians are also worried about the rise of militant Islam. Extremists threaten to derail the elections. The latest example came Friday, when Tunisian security forces killed six people outside the capital after a standoff with an Islamist group.A new report by the International Crisis Group also describes alliances between jihadi groups and organized crime, particularly around Tunisia's unstable borders with Libya and Algeria."People now want order. The old enthusiasm of the post-revolution period seems to be over, in the sense they want to close the cycle of instability and uncertainty," said the Crisis Group's Tunisia analyst, Michael Ayari.The danger, Ayari said, is if the next government uses security concerns as a pretext to crack down in ways similar to Tunisia's previous, autocratic regime."The pretext of anti-terrorism can be dangerous for democracy," said Ayari.EnnahdaThe two main parties promising answers to Tunisia's problems are radically different. One is the moderate Islamist Ennahda, which dominated the 2011 legislative vote, along with the coalition government that followed. The other is a new secular party called Nidaa Tounis, which is polling strongly. It was largely formed to oppose Ennahda, and it includes members of the former Ben Ali government, including its leader, 87-year-old Beji Caid Essebsi.  Analyst Redissi, a member of Nidaa Tounis, said Ennahda has made too many mistakes during its time in power."They have no expertise. They would love to Islamize the country. They have no competencies. They have no experience. The economy is falling down," said Redissi.But the European Council's Dworkin said Ennahda has learned from its mistakes. It resigned from power earlier this year to end a political standoff, paving the way for a new constitution and elections."Ennahda, I think, has worked quite hard to craft a version of political Islam which is ready to work within a democratic and pluralist system. And they've been given the space to do that," said Dworkin.It's unclear whether the secularists or the Islamists will emerge the winner in Sunday's vote. Polls and analysts predict neither will obtain a majority, suggesting another coalition government ahead. What's most at stake for many Tunisians is that democracy delivers and improves their lives.
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/21/uninsured-coverage_n_6200834.html?utm_hp_ref=business	A Quarter Of Uninsured Say They Can't Afford To Buy Coverage	This story was originally published by Kaiser Health News.Just days before the health law’s marketplaces reopened, nearly a quarter of uninsured said they expect to remain without coverage because they did not think it would be affordable, according to a poll released Friday.That was by far the most common reason given by people who expect to stay uninsured next year, according to the latest tracking poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation. (KHN is an editorially independent program of the foundation.) Forty-one percent of individuals without health insurance said they expected they would remain uninsured, while about half said they plan to get coverage in the coming months.The law includes subsidies to reduce premium costs and cost-sharing assistance for those who qualify, although it was not clear if the uninsured knew that.Despite heavy news coverage and marketing from insurers about the re-opening of enrollment, about 9 in 10 of the uninsured said they didn’t know when the health law’s open enrollment period began (Nov. 15). That was similar to the findings in last month’s Kaiser poll.More than 8 in 10 of the uninsured said it is at least somewhat important to them to have health insurance, with 62 percent saying it’s very important. Seven in 10 said health insurance is something they need.Other findings in Kaiser’s November poll include that most of the public reports their families have not been directly impacted by the health law, with more (24 percent) saying they have been hurt than helped (16 percent).Forty-six percent of those surveyed hold an unfavorable view of the law and 37 percent view it favorably, a slight change from last month’s survey, where 43 percent of those questioned held an unfavorable view of the law and 36 percent a favorable one.With the midterm elections giving Republicans control of the Senate and increasing the party’s majority in the House of Representatives, Americans were divided about whether the debate between the two parties over the health law would increase, the poll found. Forty-seven percent expected it, while 42 percent predicted it would stay at about the same level.This KHN story can be republished for free (details). There’s a variety of opinion about what Congress should do next with the health law. Twenty-nine percent of the public supports the law’s repeal, 17 percent favors scaling the law back, 20 percent wants the law to move ahead as is, while 22 percent chooses expanding the law.Republicans are more likely to favor repeal (52 percent) or scaling it back (24 percent), while Democrats are more likely to favor moving ahead with the law in its current form (40 percent) or expansion (34 percent). Independents fall in between, but lean toward repeal or scaling back.The poll was conducted from Nov. 5 through 13, using a telephone sample of 1,501 adults. The margin of error is +/- 3 percentage points for the full sample and +/- 9 percentage points for the uninsured.maryagnesc@kff.org | @MaryAgnesCareyKaiser Health News (KHN) is a nonprofit national health policy news service.

Photo: Getty ImagesAt 60, blonde bombshell Christie Brinkley has never looked better. Did we mention she’s 6-0?! Long celebrated for her classic, All-American good looks, the supermodel even wowed in a plunging turquoise one-piece on the cover of People magazine earlier this year (when she’s not in front of the camera, she’s still a bikini girl).  A mother of three (daughters Alexa Ray Joel and Sailor Brinkley Cook, plus son Jack), a working model, and now a beauty mogul-in-the-making, Brinkley is the embodiment of a sunny attitude and total tirelessness. The original Uptown Girl has just debuted the Christie Brinkley Authentic Skincare Collection, with a bigger rollout set to launch this spring on HSN and in Kohl’s stores nationwide. So what are Brinkley’s secrets to eternal youth? We asked her to find out. Yahoo Style: What motivated you to develop this new skincare collection? Christie Brinkley: I was looking around for skincare products and I wasn’t finding exactly what I wanted. I thought: I’m going to start my own company and hire some really great people. I did [come up with a beauty line] but I wasn’t 100% thrilled. And I learned a lot during my first two years. The main thing I learned is, if it’s got my name on it, I really want it to be good. I learned that I’m a little bit of a perfectionist when it comes to creating skincare, so I pulled back, and found new people to work with to really make it something I was proud of. YS: What was your biggest must-have in the collection? CB: I wanted our day cream to really multi-task. It’s a fab anti-ager. And I wanted it to be a great sunblock and also a base for when I’m working as a model. It’s all those things. And then our dermatologist Dr. Doris Day was able to go beyond my dreams when she told me about developing something to protect us from infrared rays: it protects our skin from all the heat emitting devices we’re surrounded by, like cell phones or microwaves or laptop screens. Related: Is 60 Too Old To Show Your Bra? YS: What are the most unexpected beauty rules you live by? CB: I have always believed in exfoliation, every day. Way back at the beginning of my career, I remember reading something that said men always look five years younger than women of the same age because they shave everyday. And I thought, Well I don’t want them to have that advantage! Back in the day you had to go to a health food store to get something like ground-up gravel to put on your face. I’ve started every day for the past 40 years exfoliating. It works for me, I do it every day. The supermodel in 1996. Photo: Corbis YS: Is there anything you did in the name of beauty that you regret? CB: Well, I have become more careful with the sun. The thing is, I just love being outdoors. I look back at some pics of myself…I grew up at the beach, I was a little surfer girl, we thought it was healthy to get a tan. And then I was paid to go get a tan. The first day on location it would be, ‘Go out and get some color.’ But of course now I can see the damage, so I try to take as good of care of my skin as a I can. The number one thing is protecting your skin. My one saving grace is that I’ve always been a hat person. But my thighs, I can literally see where my pareo ended. Related: Givenchy Muse Julia Roberts on Becoming a Supermodel at 47YS: Do your daughters ask you for beauty advice? Sailor is now modeling as well!CB: I’ve given both my daughters beauty advice and I have to say, both my girls have had me chasing after them with the sunblock. And both of them have such gorgeous skin as a result. My daughter Sailor is very independent, as she goes into her modeling, she’s a very self assured and strong minded young lady who doesn’t really need a lot of my advice. She’s got her own strong sense of style. She doesn’t really wear a lot of makeup, if any. When I go to a job and get professional hair and makeup, I can’t stand to wash it off, I love having that polish. She’s the type where as soon as they say ‘That’s a wrap’, she’ll go over and wash her face.YS: Do you keep up with social media? Does that keep you young? CB: I’m trying to learn more about social media. I just love taking photographs. I’m totally enthralled with the beauty of our planet and I just get such a thrill when I can turn it around and say ‘Look at this rainbow’, and share it with everybody. I haven’t really spent a lot of time thinking of it as a business tool.Brinkley with her daughters Alexa Ray Joel and Sailor Cook. Photo: Getty ImagesYS: The environment is a big priority for you. CB: One of the things that was important to me was that our packaging be environmentally sensitive, so we have very eco-chic packaging. The jars are so pretty; the inspiration was seaglass. And when we do put things in easy squeeze containers its made with recycled materials and the best choice of plastics. Every step of the way we’re trying to be conscious. YS: What other adventures are in store for you? CB: I just got home last night from Turks and Caicos and now I’m heading out on Monday to do an episode of Parks & Recreation. It’s the final season now. And I’m in the final days of turning in my book [out next year.] It’s going to be a lifestyle book, on health, beauty, fitness, and nutrition. I’ve been enjoying the process, just kind of revisiting things from my past and trying to share things I’ve learned over the last four decades. In my first beauty book, which was published 30 years ago, I told everybody how to get the fastest, darkest tan. And of course I’m apologizing for that now. YS: Doesn’t sound like you’re taking it easy…CB: I think that people say what keeps you young is staying busy. And my kids keep me young and laughter and all of that. When I get an assignment, a job offer, I am so grateful. I always think it’s going to be the last one. The new Christie Brinkley Authentic Skincare line.

http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/ncaaf-dr-saturday/buffalo-fires-head-coach-jeff-quinn-231045886.html	Buffalo fires head coach Jeff Quinn	Buffalo head coach Jeff Quinn has been fired. The move comes on the heels of the Bulls’ disappointing 37-27 loss to Eastern Michigan over the weekend.UB athletic director Danny White announced the decision Monday.“It is with great disappointment that we have to make this change,” White said. “Unfortunately, the performance on the field this season and over Coach Quinn’s tenure has not matched our expectations for the growth of Bulls football. With the bye week, our coaches and student-athletes have an opportunity to evaluate themselves and make the changes needed to improve. We have some very talented and hard-working student athletes on this team and we hope this change shifts the course of the 2014 season.”White expressed his thanks for Quinn’s efforts over the past four seasons."On behalf of UB Athletics, I thank Jeff for his service to the University and to the football program. Jeff and his wife, Shannon, have been great supporters of the University at Buffalo. We wish them well in their future pursuits," White said.White said in a statement that offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Alex Wood will serve as interim coach for the remainder of the season. The team has a bye this week.“We will continue focusing on the success of our student-athletes and working with the team to complete a successful season,” White said. “We have a veteran squad and there is still a lot to play for this season. We will move forward together.”Quinn arrived at Buffalo in 2010 after a stint as Cincinnati’s offensive coordinator. He took over a program entering its fifth season at the FBS level. After going a combined 9-27 in his first three seasons, the Bulls went 8-5 and appeared in a bowl game for the second time in program history in 2013.Quinn signed a five-year contract extension in January 2013.The loss to Eastern Michigan Saturday dropped the Bulls to 3-4 on the season with two of those wins being at the expense of Duquesne and Norfolk State – both FCS teams. Overall, Quinn’s coaching record at Buffalo was 20-36.The school said it would begin a national search for a new head coach immediately.- - - - - - -Sam Cooper is a contributor for the Yahoo Sports blogs.

http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/04/21/netflix-results/7965613/	Netflix, adding customers and profits, will raise prices	Bolstered by a burgeoning roster of paying customers and profits that exceeded expectations, Netflix says it plans to increase prices for new subscribers.The company on Monday announced that its subscriber base grew more than expected — adding 4 million — to 48 million members worldwide. Its net profit of $53 million, or 86 cents per share, beat analysts' estimates of 83 cents a share. It also beat the company's own forecast of $48 million and earnings per share of 78 cents.Some time in the next three months, the company plans to raise prices $1 or $2 for new members globally — a move that could also temper subscriber churn. That's because existing member monthly fees would remain at current pricing (such as $7.99 or $11.99 in the U.S., for two-stream or four-stream tier subscriptions) for a "generous time period," the company said. The lower fee could counteract the tendency for some users to cancel after binge-watching a season of House of Cards and sign up later for no penalty.Netflix, which currently has 35.7 million U.S. subscribers, continues its drive toward a domestic base of 60 million to 90 million.The company is acting from a position of strength, says Mark Mahaney, managing director of Internet for investment banking firm RBC Capital Markets. "Across the Internet, we're seeing companies like Amazon, Pandora and Netflix ... raising prices one way or another," he says. "I don't think too many consumers are going to be put off by spending a dollar or two a month for the quality, the quantity of content that Netflix has."Shares of Netflix rose in after-hours trading, up more than 6% to $369.50, having closed at $348.49 before the Los Gatos, Calif.-based company released its earnings at the market's close.Netflix stock has been volatile. It climbed to nearly $455 after the streaming service in February announced a deal with Comcast to ensure high-quality streaming of Netflix content for Comcast Net customers. Since then, the stock has taken a hit in the wake of last month's reports that Apple and Comcast were teaming up for an as-yet unannounced streaming TV service.Among Netflix's good first-quarter signs was an increased rate of growth in new U.S. streaming subscribers, an additional 2.3 million, compared with 2 million in the same quarter last year. Signs were bright for such initiatives as the DVD mail service and international business. Netflix's international base grew to by 1.75 million during the quarter to 12.7 million and accounted for about 25% of total revenue.In his letter to shareholders Monday, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings expressed his opposition to Comcast's proposal to buy Time Warner Cable, notwithstanding his own recent deal with Comcast. "Comcast is already dominant enough to be able to capture unprecedented fees from transit providers and services such as Netflix," he said.Contributing: Roger YuRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1i96SQQ
http://news.yahoo.com/ny-man-says-wife-shot-him-avoid-messy-151926440.html	NY man says wife shot him to avoid messy divorce	YONKERS, N.Y. (AP) — A real estate developer who was shot in the head as he slept at home says his cheating wife did it in an attempt to kill him and avoid a messy divorce.Kenneth Dearden provided an unusually detailed look at the case from his point of view by filing a lawsuit against his wife, a New York Police Department psychologist, a year after the shooting and two weeks before she was arrested.He said he was sleeping in their upscale suburban home on Nov. 14, 2013, and woke up with a searing pain in his jaw — from a gunshot to the base of his skull. He survived, possibly because the shooter apparently used an antique derringer that had been a gift to his wife from her parents.Dearden said his wife had been having an affair with a man since 2011 and the man was pressuring her to end her 18-year marriage."With Plaintiff no longer in the picture, Defendant could avoid a contentious divorce, keep the marital home and never admit the marital infidelity to any family or friends," says Dearden's lawsuit, which alleges assault, battery and emotional distress and seeks unspecified damages.Despite the alleged affair, Kenneth Dearden and his wife, Emily Dearden, were still living together with their two daughters when the shooting occurred and continued to do so for a year afterward, even after she filed for divorce in August. In the lawsuit, he said he lived "in fear of the possibility of another (this time successful) attack."Emily Dearden has been charged with attempted murder but denies the charge and her husband's allegations. Her lawyer, Paul Bergman, called the lawsuit "baseless" and said it was retaliation for her divorce filing."These new and outrageous allegations by Mr. Dearden, which completely contradict statements he gave the police at the time of the incident a year ago, are clearly being made by a husband who is furious that his wife has filed for divorce," he said.Emily Dearden, who is free on $150,000 bail, has been suspended from her NYPD job. She has moved to Manhattan and was ordered to stay away from the rest of the family. She has until next month to respond to the lawsuit, said Kenneth Dearden's lawyer, Mitchell Schuster.The couple's daughters are living with their father.Attorney Raoul Felder, who's not involved in the Dearden case but has handled divorces involving Elizabeth Taylor and Mike Tyson, said, "It's always a bad idea, when a marriage is ending, to stay together. There's a minimum of space and a maximum of hatred. Tempers flare, people act on impulse, hatreds boil up to a combustion level."Felder said using a gun is "definitely one way to end a marriage, but I don't think it's a good alternative."Kenneth Dearden said that on the night of the shooting he went looking for his wife to take him to the hospital and he found her on the floor of the family room "claiming she had been hit on the head."The house alarm had been turned off a few minutes earlier, and when Yonkers police arrived, Dearden told them he thought he'd been attacked by an intruder.At the hospital, it was discovered the bullet had severed an artery and lodged in his cheek.When police returned to the couple's house to investigate, Emily Dearden was washing bloody clothes and asked if they had a warrant, the lawsuit says. The police found a pair of derringers and determined one had been fired, but the bullet taken from Kenneth Dearden's head was too damaged for a ballistics match, he said.He alleged that after the shooting his wife called her lover before notifying his family and met the lover for coffee before visiting him at the hospital.
http://bgr.com/2015/08/10/car-hacks-how-to-garage-door-opener/	No one is safe: This tiny $30 device can break into your car and home	1.jpgNot everyone wants to accept this simple truth, but that doesn’t make it any less real: hackers outpace security advancements. When it comes to both online security and real-world security, hackers have already devised 10 new tools by the time security researchers come up with an effective way to block one old tool. As a result, no one is ever truly safe — and a new device recently shown off by a well-known security researcher is yet another example of just how vulnerable we really are.DON’T MISS: Why do I still use Android?Online and offline security expert Samy Kamkar took to Defcon 2015 to show off a tiny device he calls “Rolljam.” The device is as shockingly simple as it is devious and brilliant, and it can be used to break into just about any car. Worse yet, it can even be used to break into a target’s home.Rolljam is a tiny series of circuit boards with three in-built radios, Wired reports. It works by using two of the radios to jam the wireless signal sent out by a car’s keyless entry remote, while the third radio reads the code that was transmitted by the remote, which is then stored on the device.Keyless entry devices use a system of rolling codes to prevent hackers from stealing them wirelessly and reusing them at will. Once a code is used a single time, it cannot be used again — and therein lies the brilliance of the Rolljam device.Since the device blocks the signal from a car’s key fob while it is being transmitted, the unique code never reaches the owner’s car. The next time he or she presses the unlock button, a new code will be transmitted and it will successfully unlock the car. But that first code was never actually used, so the Rolljam can then transmit it at a later time and it will successfully unlock the target car.Kamkar’s device was used to successfully unlock cars made by Nissan, Cadillac, Ford, Toyota, Lotus, Volkswagen and Chrysler, and it also worked perfectly with a number of garage door openers, potentially giving the user access to a target’s home.“This is throwing the gauntlet down and saying, ‘here’s proof this is a problem,’” says Kamkar. “My own car is fully susceptible to this attack. I don’t think that’s right when we know this is solvable.” As Kamkar noted, systems like two-factor authentication use codes that automatically expire in a matter of seconds, and the same concept would render Rolljam completely ineffective.

http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/11/why-immigration-reform-helps-american-workers.html	Why Immigration Reform Helps American Workers, Too	Photo: Ethan Miller/Getty ImagesWith his executive actions shielding millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation, President Obama just gave a whole lot of workers — largely the kind who pass you your burger, mow your lawn, clean your hotel room, bus your table, and pave your driveway — a raise. The biggest beneficiaries, of course, are the undocumented immigrants themselves. But there are a whole lot of low-wage Americans who should be happy about what Obama just did, too.Obama's policy has inevitably generated hand-wringing about the White House helping foreigners at the expense of poor Americans, and undocumented workers stealing jobs from citizens. One Republican civil-rights commissioner warned: "Such an increase in lawful workers would have a deleterious effect on low-skilled American workers, particularly black workers." Rick Santorum, potential 2016 candidate, said much the same: "At a time when millions of Americans are struggling to find work and coping with stagnant wages, the president has decided to allow an additional 5 million individuals to legally compete with the existing American labor pool — diluting wages and opportunities for American workers further. This decision flies in the face of basic principles of supply-and-demand and any interest in the welfare of the American worker." But the labor economics are much more complicated than that, and there's plenty of evidence that the lowest-wage, hardest-stressed American workers will benefit from Obama's order. Even accounting for the fact that some American workers might get squeezed, overall the country should be bigger and richer for it.   To step back, the White House action primarily affects Mexican and Central-American parents and guardians who have been in the United States for at least five years. According to an analysis by the Pew Research Center, that means large proportions of the undocumented immigrants in fly-over states: Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Nebraska, and so on.Many of those parents and guardians are already working. (They aren't new competition for American workers, in other words.) But without legal status, their bargaining power is radically diminished, and they often toil in a kind of shadow economy, earning less and working harder than labor laws require. A report from the National Employment Law Project, for instance, found that one in four undocumented individuals working in a low-wage industry made less than the minimum wage. Three in four were not paid proper overtime. Businesses also shorted workers on tips, failed to pay them for work outside of their regular shifts, and declined to give them proper documentation of their income.Obama's policy should help to bring those workers out of that gray economy, bolstering their earnings. "Workers previously consigned to an underground life of exploitation, wage theft, workplace injuries, and retaliation will no longer be threatened with deportation for speaking up against abuse," said the National Employment Law Project, commending Obama's actions. "With immigration status come opportunities for better jobs and higher wages, not just for those granted protection but for all workers."And the benefits of Obama's immigration action should help all workers by leveling the employment playing field. Low-wage employers will no longer be able to stiff undocumented workers as easily as they do now, which means the difference in cost between hiring an undocumented worker and a documented worker should narrow, or even disappear. As a result, the younger and relatively unskilled Americans competing for those low-wage jobs should see higher employment levels and improved working conditions, too. That means teenagers looking for a part-time gig or single parents with high-school diplomas. It means the workers who have struggled the most through the recession and the sluggish recovery, squeezed by stagnant earnings, high rates of unemployment, and rising prices. For some evidence of the immediacy of the impact that Obama's actions might have, wonks point to his Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy. In a survey, its young beneficiaries reported feeling more secure and civically engaged. They got bank accounts and driver's licenses. There were big economic benefits, too: 70 percent have gotten their first job or started a new job in the two years since the policy came into place, with 45 percent making higher wages. The immigration order will also make it easier for currently undocumented workers to move up into better positions at work or higher-wage industries altogether, from construction to manufacturing, for instance, or from food service into an office job, given that they won't be living with the threat of deportation. That is what happened when President Reagan took a similar, if much larger, immigration action back in the 1980s:Federal data showed that immigrants in farming and sales jobs were the most likely to move to higher-paying work in different industries. By the time they became naturalized in the early 1990s, just 4 percent of farm workers were in the same industry, while roughly a quarter of those workers had shifted over to construction and other laborer jobs with better pay, according to a study published in 2002 by the federal agency that handled immigration policy.But that leads to the downside of the policy: Workers in those somewhat higher-wage industries will see more competition from currently undocumented workers. That means depressed earnings and lower employment levels. There are winners, and there are losers.Up in the higher reaches of the income scale, where the engineers and architects and lawyers live, Obama's actions should have little to no effect — much to the chagrin of the Silicon Valley and Fortune 500 businesses that have been pushing for immigration reform for years, in part to allow a flood of highly educated and skilled workers into the country. The White House action does make it easier for some of those workers to stay in the country. But it would take an act of Congress to expand the H1-B visa program, for instance, or to make other big changes. So don't worry about the most fragile, lowest-wage American workers. They're going to benefit from this action, even as some of their higher-income peers get squeezed. And ultimately, the upsides outweigh the downsides for the country writ large. According to one set of estimates, the order could boost income by $7 billion, tax revenues by $2.5 billion, and employment by 160,000. That’s not much in the context of the multi-trillion-dollar economy. But it’s not nothing, either.

All of the images are spectacular, but the money shot is a surreal photo of the No. 5 fighter jet flying at a very low altitude as it passes above the bridge while cars and pedestrians cross over the iconic span in each direction during rush hour. (Scroll down to see it at full size). The photo has gone viral on Facebook and the online message board Reddit.The photos were captured by Rich Shelton, 55, of Tiburon, which is just across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco. Shelton, a self-described 'semi-serious amateur photographer' told AOL.com in an email that he had staked out in an old World War II bunker just west of the bridge's toll plaza on Thursday, October 9, as the Blue Angels were conducting a practice run before the air show that was held a few days later.'It's a great spot because the bridge's towers align perfectly,' he said.Shelton said he used a full-frame Sony a7 with 70-400mm lens, which he typically uses to photograph landscapes and is a tricky camera to use for high-speed action.'During Thursday's practices they made numerous passes over the bridge in different positions,' he explained. 'Due to the ... approach speeds, there's a fair bit of luck involved trying to catch a perfectly centered shot.'The F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets are capable of reaching speeds of just under Mach 2, almost twice the speed of sound -- or about 1,400 mph. However, the top speed pilots are allowed to fly the jets during a performance is about 700 mph, or just under Mach 1.The U.S. Navy won't confirm the authenticity of any photo not shot by an official Navy photographer, but Lieutenant Amber Lynn Daniel, confirmed to AOL.com that the Blue Angels were practicing around the time the photo was shot.Daniel, the Blue Angels' public affairs officer, said she consulted with expert colleagues who estimated that the jet seen in the photo would have been flying at an approximate altitude of 600 feet at the moment the photo was taken and traveling at a speed of about 300 knots, or 350 mph. Both of those figures illustrate how difficult a feat it is to capture a perfect photo of a passing jet using a static camera position.But Shelton managed to pull it off, nailing the amazing shot of the F/A-18 Hornet, piloted by Lt. Cmdr. Dave Tickle, in perfect crisp focus seemingly frozen between the orange support towers of the legendary suspension bridge. Although, surprisingly, after he achieved the one-of-a-kind image, he didn't think all that much of it. 'I thought it was just another interesting Blue Angels shot,' he recalled.That all changed when he posted it on his Facebook page where it immediately began racking up hundreds of likes. Then, someone re-posted the image on Reddit and it rocketed to more than a million views on that site, Shelton said. His original Facebook post topped out at nearly 4,000 likes. 'I only expected 30 or 40,' he confessed. 'There were also many kind comments from Facebook folks, along with a number of skeptics.''It was a calculated but lucky photo, and I'm very happy with it,' he added.Shelton is married with a grown son and is retired now. He volunteers as a search manager for the Marin County Sheriff Search and Rescue unit, which keeps him 'very busy.'He's been enamored with photography since he was a kid, he said, and even managed to pay for college with money he earned doing event photography. Lately, he's rediscovered the art.'The advent of digital cameras and printers have really reignited my love of photography,' Shelton told AOL.com. 'I'm always looking at the world around me in the context of how I might capture an interesting photo.'To see more of Shelton's fine work, visit his Flickr page.

http://www.aol.com/article/2014/10/31/virgin-galactic-space-flight-crashes-in-mojave-desert/20987027/	One dead after Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo crashes in the Mojave Desert	One pilot is dead and another injured after the second commercial spaceship crash this week, which may have been caused by a new fuel source.Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo crashed Friday morning in the Mojave Desert, KGET reported. One pilot was reported by the Associated Press to be dead, the other is seriously injured. Officials admitted during a Friday press conference they reformulated the fuel.The pilot ejected from the dying aircraft and sustained serious injuries, sources told CBS News. The co-pilot died, but it is not clear if he was able to eject. Both were test pilots employed by Standard Composite.The incident occurred during a test flight shortly after the "space flight vehicle separated from the WhiteKnightTwo, the vehicle that carried it aloft," the FAA said in a statement.The WhiteKnightTwo launch aircraft landed safely, according to a Virgin statement, but Scaled Composite President Kevin Mickey said Friday that the fuel had been modified.This was the SpaceShipTwo's fourth powered flight, but "a new fuel formulation that had been proven and tested on the ground" was used Friday, said Mickey.It had not been used on any prior flights, but Mickey insisted it was not the cause of the accident.Virgin Galactic initially announced just after 10:00 a.m. PST that the aircraft experienced an "in-flight anomaly." #SpaceShipTwo has experienced an in-flight anomaly. Additional info and statement forthcoming. - Virgin Galactic (@virgingalactic) October 31, 2014One hour later, the CEO of Mojave Air and Space Port, Stu Witt, confirmed to KGET that the aircraft had indeed crashed."A space emergency like this, a crash, is not an everyday occurrence," Witt said during a Friday afternoon press conference. "We are human, and it hurts."SpaceShipTwo was able to hold two pilots and six passengers, according to the Virgin Galactic website. It was roughly the size of an executive jet.The craft was launched into the stratosphere by WhiteKnightTwo and acts as a glider. Pilots have the ability to use a type of hybrid rocket engine to propel the space ship forward, according to Virgin.The engine was also able to be turned off to allow the SpaceShipTwo to glide back down to the runway should any in-flight problems have arisen.It is not clear what problems led to the spacecraft's crash.A commercial rocket built by Orbital Sciences Corporation spectacularly exploded on national television at liftoff Tuesday night.There were no casualties in the failed launch because the rocket was unmanned.Branson famously said earlier this year that he expected to take his family to space on a Virgin Galactic rocket by September 2014. He is expected to arrive Saturday morning at the crash scene.It is not known if that trip ever happened, but, if it has not, this setback may cause him to think twice about such a voyage.This is a developing story, more information will come as it is made available.

Credit: Reuters/Heikki Saukkomaa/LehtikuvaLONDON (Reuters) - Don't call it a comeback yet. But Nokia (NOK1V.HE) is thinking about how to revive its brand name in consumer markets just months after selling off its former flagship mobile phones business to Microsoft (MSFT.O) for more than $7 billion."I think you can expect our brand will return to the consumer world," Nokia's chief executive Rajeev Suri said on Friday when asked about rumors that the networks equipment maker was looking to re-enter the handset market.Suri told investors at a presentation in London that his company will look to licensing the brand name to other firms rather than starting up a new handset business itself."We see brand licensing as an opportunity ... But I would say it is more of a long-term opportunity," Suri said of potential deals where other makers of consumer electronics might pay Nokia to use its brand on their products.Another company executive on Friday pointed to Porsche Design as an example of the sort of brand-licensing deals Nokia might consider.No deal is imminent but the Nokia brand could eventually appear on a range of electronics, not necessarily phones. "This is not a sentimentality thing," Suri said.Microsoft this week dropped the Nokia name on its latest Lumia 535 smartphone, having acquired the Nokia business back in April.Nokia was once synonymous with mobile phones but the brand's ranking sank to 98th this year among the world's best known corporate names, down from fifth in 2007, according to a survey by market researcher Interbrand.The slide came after first Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and then Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) entered the smartphone market to successfully challenge the Finnish company's decade of market leadership.(With additional reporting by Paul Sandle; Editing by Greg Mahlich)

(Grace Tung-Thompson/NC State)Researchers wanted to know whether vomit could facilitate the spread of norovirus, a highly contagious stomach ailment notorious for turning unlucky cruise ships into ground zeroes for diarrhea epidemics. But first, they needed a way to reproduce the physical action of vomiting -- so they built a "vomiting device" to puke on command in the lab.Here it is in action:A machine that creates projectile vomit demonstrates how vomit contributes to the spread of human norovirus. Grace Tung-Thompson explains at Jaykus Laboratory of North Carolina State University. (NoroCORE)Science is glorious.By using the device to approximate the spray of human vomit, the researchers found the first direct evidence that norovirus can be spread by way of the technicolor yawn. Their findings were published Wednesday in the journal PLOS ONE.[This blood test can tell you every virus you’ve ever had]"When one person vomits, the aerosolized virus particles can get into another person's mouth and, if swallowed, can lead to infection," study co-author Lee-Ann Jaykus of North Carolina State University said in a statement. "But those airborne particles could also land on nearby surfaces like tables and door handles, causing environmental contamination. And norovirus can hang around for weeks, so anyone that touches that table and then puts their hand to their mouth could be at risk for infection."(Grace Tung-Thompson/NC State)In other words, you don't have to have direct exposure to vomit contaminated with norovirus in order to get sick. The physical act of vomiting helps the virus proliferate by leaving behind particles much less conspicuous than a puddle of sick.[One day, doctors might prescribe viruses instead of antibiotics]In addition to a viral soup the likes of which would be found in a sick person's puke, the researchers used vanilla pudding to simulate the viscosity of vomit. They determined that 800 milliliters of vomit was a good upper threshold, while anything lower than 50 milliliter of liquid would count as a "dry heave". They also determined that coughs were common after the act of vomiting, so they were sure to simulate a few sharp exhalations with their device during the experiment.Ultimately, only around .02 percent of the viral particles ended up airborne, with the rest staying put inside the viscous fake vomit. But that small percentage still amounts to thousands of viral particles -- ones that could end up on hands, toilets and door knobs, just to name the most likely of surfaces.[Here’s how fast viruses spread in your office]And those errant particles are more than enough to cause infection.In further experiments, Jaykus and her colleagues will determine just how long these viral particles can survive on different surfaces -- and how far a spew of vomit is able to project them.Read More:You can earn $13,000 a year selling your poopYes, your dog can get the fluHere’s why coffee makes you poopThis blood test can tell you every virus you’ve ever had

http://www.aol.com/article/2014/10/12/key-question-how-did-dallas-worker-catch-ebola/20976811/	Key question: How did Dallas worker catch Ebola?	How did it happen?That's the big question as federal health officials investigate the case of a Dallas health worker who treated an Ebola patient and ended up with the disease herself.These are professionals and this is the United States, where the best conditions and protective gear are available, unlike in West Africa, where the Ebola epidemic is raging in much poorer conditions.The health worker wore protective gear while having extensive contact with Thomas Eric Duncan, the Liberian man who died Wednesday of Ebola at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital.Officials say she has not been able to pinpoint any breach in infection control protocols, although there apparently was a breach, they say.Experience shows that health workers can safely care for Ebola patients, "but we also know that it's hard and that even a single breach can result in contamination," Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Sunday on CBS' "Face the Nation."The situation also raises fresh concerns about whether any U.S. hospital can safely handle Ebola patients, as health officials have insisted is possible.Some questions and answers about the new case.Q: What protection do health workers have?A: The exact gear can vary. A hazardous material type suit usually includes a gown, two sets of gloves, a face mask, and an eye shield. There are strict protocols for how to use it correctly."When you put on your garb and you take off your garb, it's a buddy system," with another health worker watching to make sure it's done right, said Dr. Dennis Maki, University of Wisconsin-Madison infectious disease specialist and former head of hospital infection control.Q: How might infection have occurred?A: Officials are focusing on two areas: How the garb was removed, and the intensive medical procedures Duncan received, which included kidney dialysis and a breathing machine. Both involve inserting tubes - into blood vessels or an airway. That raises the risk a health worker will have contact with the patient's bodily fluids, which is how Ebola spreads."Removing the equipment can really be the highest risk. You have to be extremely careful and have somebody watching you to make sure you remember all the steps," said Dr. Eileen Farnon, a Temple University doctor who formerly worked at the CDC and led teams investigating past Ebola outbreaks in Africa."After every step you usually would do hand hygiene," washing your hands with antiseptic or being sprayed with a chlorine spray, she said.Q: How else could infection have happened?A: Some of the garb the health worker takes off might brush against a surface and contaminate it. New data suggest that even tiny droplets of a patient's body fluids can contain the virus, Maki said."I can have on the suit and be very careful, but I can pick up some secretions or body fluids on a surface" and spread it that way, he said.Q: Can any U.S. hospital safely treat Ebola patients?A: Frieden and other health officials say yes, but others say the new case shows the risks."We can't control where the Ebola patient appears," so every hospital's emergency room needs to be prepared to isolate and take infection control precautions, Maki said.That said, "I don't think we should expect that small hospitals take care of Ebola patients. The challenge is formidable," and only large hospitals like those affiliated with major universities truly have enough equipment and manpower to do it right, Maki said."If we allow it to be taken care of in hospitals that have less than optimal resources, we will promote the spread," he warned.The case heightens concern for health workers' safety, and nurses at many hospitals "are alarmed at the inadequate preparation they see," says a statement from Rose Ann DeMoro, executive director of the union, National Nurses United.Q: Should Ebola patients be transferred to one of the specialized centers that have treated others in the U.S.?A: Specialized units are the ideal, but there are fewer than half a dozen in the nation and they don't have unlimited beds. "It is also a high-risk activity to transfer patients," potentially exposing more people to the virus, Farnon said.Q. What is CDC recommending the hospital do?A. Training has been ramped up, and the CDC now recommends the hospital minimize the number of people caring for an Ebola patient, perform only procedures essential to support the patient's care, and name a fulltime infection control supervisor while any Ebola patient is being cared for. Frieden also said the agency was taking a new look at personal protective equipment, "understanding that there is a balance and putting more on isn't always safer - it may make it harder to provide effective care."
http://www.inquisitr.com/1704082/wwe-news-massive-wrestlemania-31-update-involving-brock-lesnar-the-undertaker-and-sting/	WWE News: Massive WrestleMania 31 Update Involving Brock Lesnar, The Undertaker, And Sting	It has become a custom for WWE to think up a lot of random ideas for WrestleMania each year. Due to the rise of issues involving the Mania line-up, it was reported that WWE was considering the idea of changing the plans up for people such as Dean Ambrose, Dolph Ziggler, Seth Rollins, and Roman Reigns.Now it appears that while things will be switched up, they will be switched in a massive way.According to Daily Wrestling News, Triple H and Vince McMahon are in major disagreement involving Mania plans. Triple H wants to face Sting, but Vince wants Sting to face The Undertaker. Vince was reportedly fine with the idea of Triple H/Sting if Undertaker cannot return. Meanwhile, Triple H wants to face Sting whether or not Undertaker can come back or not.Triple H reportedly had the idea that if The Undertaker returns, he could be added to the WWE World Heavyweight Title picture. Which would make a triple threat match happen between Roman Reigns, Brock Lesnar, and The Undertaker.Roman would still come out on top, but who takes the pin is up in the air. If WWE can sign Brock Lesnar, Undertaker would be pinned by Reigns for the title win. If Lesnar is not re-signed by WWE, he would take the pin. The idea makes sense for a few reasons. It puts less stress on The Undertaker, who wouldn’t have to do as much. Also, it takes stress off of Reigns on a massive stage. Plus, Taker would want revenge on Lesnar, obviously. So the concept makes sense a bit.Triple H is still heavy on pushing Reigns; it is said that Vince is having second thoughts, however. This is also present among many others backstage. Still though, WWE has been trying to push Reigns to get him ready. If you ask fans, WWE seems to be failing to make “Roman Reigns look strong.”This is why we have been hearing reports regarding WWE changing the plans up to remove Reigns from the title picture in favor of someone like Ambrose and Ziggler, who are said to be “ready” while Reigns is simply not just yet.WWE has also been building various men to help them out regardless of who they want to go with. Ambrose has come out looking great in his rivalry with Bray Wyatt while WWE has massively pushed Dolph Ziggler after they pretty much made him at Survivor Series in November. Meanwhile, WWE has built up Seth Rollins and have an opportunity to do anything with him due to his possession of the Money in the Bank briefcase that he won over the summer.Reigns’ spot is still unsafe, but it could be set in stone if Triple H gets his way and faces Sting while Taker is thrown into the WWE World Heavyweight Title picture. WWE obviously has a lot of opportunities they can still set in motion, but they’d have to begin programs within the next month to build them for WrestleMania 31. So we should find out some of WWE’s plans by The Royal Rumble PPV.[IMG Credit: WWE.com]
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michaelprice/where-millennials-went-wr_b_5969670.html?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000592	Where Millennials Went Wrong and How They're Paying the Price	Millennials messed up and as a result they're paying the price.Here's a few unfortunate facts about Millennials:They contributed $1 trillion to our national student loan debt [Bloomberg] They are the most educated generation in human history, yet they have the highest share of people who are unemployed in the last 40 years [USA Today] 48% of employed college graduates have jobs that do not require a four-year degree. [The Center for College Affordability and Productivity] Nearly 1/3 have postponed marriage or having a baby due to the recession. [Pew Research]Millennials were raised in an a world with unprecedented opportunity. When most Millennials were in middle school or high school they witnessed the birth of the Information Age. This ushered in new industries and a re-birth in education.Millennials went wrong when they ignored the unique opportunities in front of them in exchange for the opportunities presented to their parents.As the Information Age exploded, along with it came the rise in technology, and your average Millennial missed the boat. Instead of pursuing a path in a growing field like computer science to develop a skillset that would open up endless career options, most Millennials have chosen college degrees and careers in business and liberal arts, both of which are degrees that are virtually worthless to employers today.It is because of these detrimental decisions that the stats previously mentioned exist.You can blame the economy as much as you want, but it's only a scapegoat. Like previous generations, Millennials expected that a job would be waiting for them after college, and not just any job, but a high paying job. They were wrong, and the recession was only partially to blame.The real reason Millennials have the highest rate of unemployment in the last four decades despite being the most highly educated generation in human history is because they are largely unskilled.Just being smart is no longer good enough. Anybody can get good grades. Paying attention in class and testing well isn't a skill, it's simply a task that millions can perform, and for that reason this is why a college education has become less effective in gaining employment.Employers need to verify that someone has skills that can be utilized to improve their business, and Millennials are deficient in this department.So where do we go from here?Millennials were misguided by their parents, their professors and their guidance counselors. To no fault of their own these influencers passed on the path to success that worked for them. Unfortunately, they didn't anticipate how the world would evolve.If Millennials want to undo the damage done by years of misguidance, bad advice and bad decisions, they must re-invent themselves. This likely sounds aggravating to most considering that most Millennials have just spent or are in the midst of spending several years and several thousand dollars pursuing a path down a traditional route. However, reinventing yourself is necessary for self-preservation.More than just a person, you must become a brand. You must separate yourself from the pack by proving you offer something the "others" don't.For starters, Millennials need to establish a portfolio both online and offline. If you're not receiving the job opportunities or the salary you desire, you need to work for free. Take on some pro-bono project-based work in your chosen field, do an incredible job and get a reference letter. Rinse and repeat this process at least 3 - 5 times.Last but not least, you need to make sure you have skills for today's new working environment. To survive in the highly competitive environment of employment today, you must be a Jack-of-all-trades.As an example, if you're pursuing a career in business you need to learn basic programming, graphic design, video editing, photo editing, accounting, web design, etc. All of these skills can be learned online at your own pace and for free or at a very minimal cost. Lynda.com, Udemy.com and even YouTube are great resources.All hope is not lost. Opportunity is abundant, but in order to qualify Millennials must be prepared for the unique obstacles that lie before their generation.Michael Price is the author of "What Next The Millennial's Guide to Surviving and Thriving in the Real World" now available at whatnextquest.com.

http://www.aol.com/article/2014/11/22/house-gop-report-debunks-benghazi-conspiracy-theories/20997710/	House GOP report debunks Benghazi conspiracy theories	There's something in the industry we call a "Friday news dump."Because Internet usage, and news consumption in general, typically drop over the weekend, when someone puts out news that they hope few people will notice, they usually announce it Friday late afternoon or evening.The White House certainly does it, like when the president sent more troops into Iraq on Nov. 7."The new deployment will double the U.S. troop presence in Iraq," Fox News' Patti Ann Browne said.House Republicans proved they knew the trick too when they announced Friday afternoon that a two-year investigation determined the Obama administration responded appropriately to 2012's attack on the Benghazi consulate.CNN's Brian Stelter assessed the report saying, "Some of the myths, some of the more conspiratorial myths are being debunked," Saturday morning.The Friday report by the Republican-led House Select Committee on Intelligence found no intelligence failure prior to the attacks, no evidence that the White House told the military to stand down during the attack and no evidence that the CIA was involved in related arms shipments. The report did, however, find that the consulate was inadequately protected.As for the initial message from the Obama administration that the attack began with a spontaneous protest, the committee did find that inaccurate but blamed unclear intelligence reports, not a purposeful attempt from the White House to mislead.The select committee's report on the Benghazi attack that killed four Americans took two years and thousands of hours of work in Congress.
http://www.aol.com/article/2014/12/15/families-of-newtown-victims-sue-rifle-manufacturer/21116497/	Families of Newtown victims sue rifle manufacturer	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The families of nine of the 26 people killed and a teacher wounded two years ago at the Sandy Hook Elementary School filed a lawsuit Monday against the manufacturer, distributor and seller of the rifle used in the shooting.The negligence and wrongful death lawsuit, filed in Bridgeport Superior Court, asserts that the Bushmaster AR-15 rifle should not have been made publicly available because it was designed for military use and is unsuited for hunting or home defense."The AR-15 was specifically engineered for the United States military to meet the needs of changing warfare," attorney Josh Koskoff said in a release. "In fact, one of the Army's specifications for the AR-15 was that it has the capability to penetrate a steel helmet."In addition to Bushmaster, the defendants are Camfour, a firearm distributor, and Riverview Gun Sales, the East Windsor store where the gunman's mother purchased the Bushmaster rifle in 2010.Messages seeking comment from the defendants were not immediately returned.Bill Sherlach, whose wife, Mary, was killed in the shooting, said he believes in the Second Amendment but also that the gun industry needs to be held to "standard business practices" when it comes to assuming the risk for producing, making and selling a product."These companies assume no responsibility for marketing and selling a product to the general population who are not trained to use it nor even understand the power of it," he said.The plaintiffs include Sherlach and the families of Vicki Soto, Dylan Hockley, Noah Pozner, Lauren Rousseau, Benjamin Wheeler, Jesse Lewis, Daniel Barden, Rachel D'Avino and teacher Natalie Hammond, who was injured in the shooting.The lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary damages.Nicole Hockley, Dylan's mother, planned a news conference later Monday morning with U.S. Rep. Elizabeth Esty and U.S. Sens. Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy.The Newtown gunman, Adam Lanza, shot and killed his mother, Nancy Lanza, on the morning of Dec. 14, 2012, before driving to the school and gunning down 20 children and six educators with the semi-automatic rifle. He committed suicide as police arrived.In 2005, Congress and President George W. Bush approved a federal law that shielded gun makers from lawsuits over criminal use of their products, with some exemptions.In a lawsuit over the .223-caliber Bushmaster rifle used in the Washington, D.C.-area sniper shootings that killed 10 people in 2002, Bushmaster and a gun dealer agreed to pay $2.5 million to two survivors and six families in a 2004 settlement. It was the first time a gun manufacturer had agreed to pay damages to settle claims of negligent distribution of weapons, according to the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence.In that settlement, Bushmaster paid $550,000 and the Washington state gun dealer, where the sniper's rifle came from, paid $2 million.In 2002, a federal judge in California ruled that Bushmaster and other gun manufacturers were not responsible for a 1999 shooting spree that killed a postal worker and injured five people at a Jewish community center in Los Angeles. The judge said a lawsuit by the victims' families did not show a link between the manufacturers and the shooting rampage.Earlier on AOL.com: Flags to fly at half-staff on Newtown anniversary Newtown acquires home of Sandy Hook shooter Agency: Schools helped Lanza's mom 'appease' him
http://www.voanews.com/content/hong-kong-protesters-threaten-to-seize-buildings/2469749.html	Hong Kong Student Leaders Agree to Talks with Government	Hong Kong student leaders spearheading days of mass protests have agreed to 11th-hour talks with the pro-Beijing government aimed at easing the crisis that has brought much of the city to a standstill.The agreement, announced early Friday, came just hours after the territory's embattled chief executive offered to meet with protest leaders.  In extending the offer, however, Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying refused a key student demand that he step down.Student leaders had threatened to storm government offices if Leung refused their resignation demand.  But as the resignation deadline passed, there were no reports of violence near the offices, which are surrounded by throngs of students and under heavy police guard.The pro-democracy group Occupy Central welcomed the agreement and said leaders "hope the talks can provide a turning point in the current political stalemate."  But Occupy Central, like other student groupings involved in the standoff, also demanded that Leung quit.Hong Kong authorities had earlier urged thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators to immediately end their blockade of the city center. The protests, nearly a week old, have brought large parts of the Asian financial hub to a standstill.“About 3,000 government officials will try their best tomorrow to return to work as [much] as possible. To maintain public service, the government headquarters must operate as usual,” the government said in a statement. “We urge the Occupy Central leaders and organizers to stop the movement immediately.”Tensions late ThursdayDuring the day, the protesters prepared face masks and goggles while police brought in supplies of tear gas and other riot gear as tensions grew outside the imposing government compound near the waterfront.Police warned of serious consequences if the protesters try to surround or occupy government buildings, which protesters had threatened to do earlier if Leung didn't resign by midnight Thursday.The protesters remained calm after Leung's address, although many were dissatisfied and said his comments were not enough.“I don't think this is sufficient. I think he's trying to slow down the process and make us go home ... [but] people are feeling tired, mentally and physically and the numbers may decrease,” said Nicholas Chan, 20, a journalism student at Chinese University.“The bargaining power is in the numbers," he said.Police actionTaking over government buildings would mark a major escalation in the protests, and police are warning of "serious consequences" if the demonstrators try to do so.​In his news conference, Leung said authorities would continue to tolerate the protests as long as participants did not charge police lines. “In any place in the world, if there are any protesters that surround, attack, or occupy government buildings like police headquarters, or the chief executive's office ... the consequences are serious,” he said. Earlier Thursday, police spokesman Steve Hui said authorities will not tolerate any illegal surrounding of government buildings, including law enforcement agencies, and urged protesters to stay "calm and restrained." The student protesters have been camping outside Leung's office in the semi-autonomous Chinese city.Tens of thousands of demonstrators have occupied several main thoroughfares in Hong Kong since last Friday. They are angry about China's refusal to allow universal suffrage in 2017 elections.The Communist Party on Thursday signaled it is not ready to compromise. A front-page editorial in the People's Daily, a party mouthpiece, expressed confidence in the embattled Leung.The editorial said the protests violated Hong Kong's law, blocked traffic, disrupted social order, and hurt peace and prosperity. It added that Beijing firmly supports the handling of the protests by Hong Kong police.Police on Sunday used tear gas and pepper spray in a failed attempt to disperse the protest camps. But police pulled back, allowing the protests to continue.There are reports that Leung is reluctant to use further force against the demonstrators, and that he will instead attempt to wait out the protests in hopes they subside or lose public support, and will only intervene if there is looting or violence, said a government source with ties to Leung.China reactionEarlier Thursday in Washington, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi slammed the protests as illegal and warned the U.S. and others to not interfere with China's internal affairs.Wang's comments came after meeting U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who said he has "high hopes that Hong Kong authorities will exercise restraint and respect protesters' rights to express their views."U.S. President Barack Obama also participated in the meeting, where he underscored U.S. hopes for a peaceful resolution of the Hong Kong standoff.A White House statement said the Obama administration is closely following events in Hong Kong.It also noted consistent U.S. support for the "open system" of governance in the city necessary to maintain its "stability and prosperity."Obama opens a three-day visit to Beijing on November 10. The protests mark the worst unrest in Hong Kong since Beijing took control of the one-time British colony in 1997.Some material for this report came from Reuters, AFP and AP.
http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2013/11/19/elon-musk-tesla-fire-changes/3637187/	Feds open formal probe into Tesla electric car fires	The electric car maker has sent through a software change to make its cars ride higherThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said today it has opened a formal investigation into the safety of the Tesla Model S electric car following two reports of battery fires after striking roadway debris.The agency said its safety investigation was prompted by recent "undercarriage strikes" in Washington state and Tennessee. In both cases, fires resulted after the cars both ran over debris on the road that pierced the battery compartment. After news of the probe broke, Tesla shares fell to $116 in pre-market trading but climbed back once the market opened. They closed 3.7%, or $4.51, up for the day at $126.09 a share.TESLA STOCK: Shares rise despite federal probe into firesEarly Tuesday before NHTSA's announcement, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that he taking three steps as a result of the fires, but added that he stands behind their safety. The steps were:•Higher ground clearance to make them less likely to strike road debris that can potentially penetrate the battery pack and ignite a blaze.•Asking federal safety regulators to "conduct a full investigation as soon as possible into the fires." Musk gave no hint that NHTSA was about to open an investigation.•Amending the cars' warranty to cover damage due to fire.A NHTSA probe can lead to recall, but earlier this month Musk says he has no plans to order one because he doesn't think it is warranted.Musk announced the steps in a lengthy post on Tesla's blog. In it, he offers yet another strong defense of the car's safety, especially as it relates to protection from fire. "We believe the evidence is clear that there is no safer car on the road than the Model S," he writes. His company expects to produce more than 20,000 of the electric cars this year, which sell for about $70,000 and up.He calls media reaction to the three fires a gross overreaction, especially given how thousands of conventional cars have been consumed by gasoline fires from ruptured tanks over the years.He says his battery-powered car is actually safer than just about any gas-powered car on the road."Since the Model S went into production mid last year, there have been over 400 deaths and 1,200 serious injuries in the United States alone due to gasoline car fires, compared to zero deaths and zero injuries due to Tesla fires anywhere in the world."In the posting of its investigation, NHTSA noted that passengers in the Teslas that caught on fire were able to escape. "In each incident, the vehicle's battery monitoring system provided escalating visible and audible warnings, allowing the driver to execute a controlled stop and exit the vehicle before the battery emitted smoke and fire," NHTSA writes.Tesla stock fell after reports of the electric cars catching fire after striking road debris VPCTwo of the Tesla fires were caused when the vehicle struck road debris that pierced the battery compartment. The third happened in Mexico when a Model S crashed. In each case, the occupants escaped unharmed. Musk says it's proof of the car's safety.But given the media outcry, Musk indicates he decided to act even though he already stands by the car. He says the plan to create more ground clearance under the cars has already been implemented.Tesla has already sent a signal to the computers in all Model S cars to tell them to increase the vehicle's ground clearance at highway speeds. he says the goal is to reduce the chance of hitting objects on the road. Another software update in January is aimed at letting drivers set their preferred road height for themselves and passengers.As for the NHTSA involvement in probing the three accidents that led to fires, Musk says that if regulators offers suggestions on how to improve fire safety in the Model S, he will immediately implement them. he has previously said he does not expect that the Model S will need to be recalled over the fires.When it comes to extending the warranty on the sedan, Musk says his decision will apply to Tesla models and be applicable even if the driver is held to be a fault for the fire.Tesla says the regular Model S can sprint from zero to 60 miles per hour in 5.4 seconds and has a top speed of 125 mph.  (Photo: Tesla) Fullscreen Tesla Model S electric car, which has a range of 208 miles to 265 miles depending on the size of battery and price.  (Photo: Tesla) Fullscreen The Tesla Model S electric car dashboard is devoid of the usual switches and knobs -- most car functions are handled via the 17-inch touchscreen in the center.  (Photo: Tesla) Fullscreen The Model S has active air suspension and using the touchscreen in the dash, the drive can raise and lower the ride height for road and weather conditions.  (Photo: Tesla) Fullscreen Tesla Model S.  (Photo: Tesla) Fullscreen Like this topic?
