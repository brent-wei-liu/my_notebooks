She verbally ripped him to pieces. Barack didn’t have much of a comeback. He knows he’s been ratted out.”Multiple alleged insiders assert Barack has a secret love nest inside the Jefferson Hotel, which is just a few blocks from the White House. He apparently utilizes a door in the hotel’s private wine cellar to come and go without being seen.“”The ‘commander-in-cheat,’ as he’s known at the place, comes and goes so frequently that some hotel staffers call the door he uses the ‘Barack entrance,’” one source claimed.“It’s easy for the president to get to and best of all, it has a secret entrance so he can come and go discreetly.”First lady Michelle Obama reads “Twas the night before Christmas” to patients, families, and staff at Children’s National Health System in Washington, Monday, Dec. 15, 2014. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)The report comes just a few weeks after the Enquirer alleged that Michelle told Barack to “get out” of their home after she saw him hitting on an engaged woman while on a campaign stop in Chicago.Shortly before that, Globe magazine claimed that the Obama’s marriage is a “sham” and that it was about to come to a “startling end” because Barack had been caught seeking after “yet another” married Hollywood actress.Like this:Related</td>\n",

But before you call PETA, you should know that in the world of Pokémon, this is all in good fun. Matches end when a Pokémon faints, and no one really gets hurt.At a glance, it would seem that these games are strictly for kids. The primary reason for this, of course, is that they are for kids — or at least, that’s who they’re meant to appeal to. What you might not realize unless you look past the cartoonish veneer, however, is that Pokémon games are intricately designed experiences that are every bit as deep and complex as the latest Final Fantasy or Call of Duty. Pokémon is just more accessible.This year’s dual installments are Pokémon Omega Ruby and Pokémon Alpha Sapphire (aka ORAS). Instead of being entirely new installments, ORAS are remakes of Game Boy Advance games from 2003. That might sound like they’re intended to be a quick and easy cash-in to get new Pokémon titles on the market in time for Christmas, but really they’re not.The games — which are nearly identical, aside from a few exclusive Pokémon and slightly different antagonists — have received a total graphical makeover and have gotten many much-needed updates to make the games fit into the modern Pokémon landscape.You play as a boy or girl whose family has just moved to the Hoenn region of the Pokémon world, and you want to become a trainer. There doesn’t appear to be much else to do in the world of Pokémon, since Pokémon are all most people talk about, and about a third of the people you meet are also trainers.Anyway, once you start your new hobby, you take off on a journey to explore the region, collecting all the Pokémon you can, training them to become powerful fighters, taking on gym leaders, and thwarting a criminal plot along the way. It’s all standard stuff for a Pokémon game, but no one really plays Pokémon for the story. You play it because it’s a blast.</td>\n",

It is not known if there were any injuries.A thick wall of what appears to be vines separates spectators from the explosions, likely shielding any of them from serious harm.The person taking the video simply hunkered down and caught as much as he could.According to Reddit user Bartjay, most Italian fireworks are \"shot the traditional way, meaning no electrical fuse ... every pyrotechnical article has to be lit manually.\"Accordingly, u [sic] will have a lot of open fuses, which are prone to go off if there is a flop.\"It is easy to see how one misfired firework could result in such a stunning display if all those fuses are out in the open waiting patiently to be lit.The computerized systems used for fireworks displays in the U.S. are not flawless, though.A computer glitch at a 2012 fireworks display in San Diego resulted in every firework firing within 15 seconds.There were, however, no injuries.</td>\n",

Sylt was the base for the German navy during the world wars and eventually grew into a luxurious destination for its upper echelon; Rügen on the other hand was what Conde Nast Traveler called the \"Soviet version of the Hamptons.\"Today, you can travel to many of the islands in Germany's archipelago, or you can bask in their peacefulness in the photographic tour below.Sylt Island Phil via Getty Images David Peevers via Getty Images Usedom Island Meinzahn via Getty Images fhm via Getty Images Fred Froese via Getty Images Rügen Island RicoK69 via Getty Images Jorg Greuel via Getty Images Bernhard Lang via Getty Images Hiddensee Island Photo by Lars Oppermann via Getty Images www.galerie-ef.de via Getty Images FHR via Getty Images Föhr Island Ralf Wilken via Getty Images Ingeborg Knol via Getty Images Ingeborg Knol via Getty Images Borkum Island Oliver Hoffmann via Getty Images Karl Johaentges / LOOK-foto via Getty Images Konrad Wothe / LOOK-foto via Getty Images Amrum Island Raimund Linke via Getty Images F.

              "      <td>Theresa Schue by permissionWhen Theresa Schue snapped photos of the landscape on a church outing she wasn’t expecting to capture anything but the view. What she got has her so puzzled she has turned to the Internet to find answers. Schue published her photo of what appears to be the apparition of an elemental or nature spirit lurking in the woods in the Angels, Ghosts and Paranormal Facebook Group on Nov. 1.According to Theresa the picture was taken from the train in the Titusville, PA area as she was returning from a church trip in October. The image was captured with the camera on her cellphone. She is seeking an explanation for this mysterious image.Titusville is known for its haunted history as a result of ghastly mass graves, a bout with the plague and the gory deaths of both miners and prostitutes, says Schlue.While some viewers are skeptical and claim the image is simply a trick of the eye, known as matrixing or pareidolia, others are not so sure. Pareidolia or matrixing occurs when the brain attempts to make sense out of chaotic visual stimuli and interprets the image as something that makes sense. This often takes the form of seeing the human form, including facial features, where none exists. According to Grant Wilson, former lead investigator on “Ghost Hunters” one of the telltale signs of pareidolia or matixing is when the features of the apparition are made up of parts of the natural environment, such as leaves, twigs and branches. Another clue to pareidolia is when the features of the face are cartoony or out-of-proportion to the human face, says Wilson. Whether this applies to nature or elemental spirits is up for interpretation.Others think the image captured in Theresa Schue’s photo is that of an elemental spirit or some sort of forest spirit. They contend that nature and elemental spirits contain features that mimic the natural environment. Elemental spirits are believed to inhabit wooded areas. While some are protectors of the forest, others are negative spirits that roam the earth.Schue is unsure of what she has captured on film and seeks the advice of those with knowledge of the paranormal and/or photography in helping her identify the image. Although she makes no claims that she has captured evidence of the paranormal, she definitely sees the image of a human-like creature in her photo.She has received nearly 200 responses to her post. Responses range from those who claim not to see anything in the photo to those who believe she has captured the image of multiple spirits.When questioned about digitally altering the photo, Theresa explained,The picture was taken by my cell phone. I am 65 and do not know anything about touching stuff up. We were in a church group and another 63 yr old lady and I were looking at the pictures and this oddly stuck out oddly to us. It was taken on October 18 and we had shown it to a few church friends and we did not know what we saw. It was not explainable. My daughter decided today without my permission [to] send it to your group. I never wanted to send it out because I knew there would be doubters. But, now I am at least getting answers. Even if there may be those who doubt.Now that the photo has been published, Theresa says she would like help identifying the mysterious bigfoot-like creature that appears in the photo. So, now it’s your turn to help Theresa Schue figure out what this mysterious image really is. Is it a spirit, an illusion or something else?</td>\n",

              "      <td>Timing is everything in warfare, so here's a helpful tip for any up-and-coming global superpowers, evil masterminds or future corporate nation-states. The best year to stage your very own version of Red Dawn could be in 2028, when the U.S. Navy, the main protector of America's sovereignty, will be at its weakest.More specifically, the U.S. attack submarine fleet is expected to decline to a modern low. Today the Navy has 54 attack subs and four special guided-missile boats packing more than 150 cruise missiles each. But, as the blog War Is Boring explains:Swift, silent and heavily armed, the Navy's nuclear-powered attack subs are by far its, and America's, most powerful weapons for high-tech warfare. A single nuclear submarine can sink several attacking ships far from shore and also pummel ground targets with cruise missiles before slipping away at great depth. But the Pentagon took a long break from building subs during the 1990s and 2000s. Where once the Navy had bought four new undersea attack boats every year, for a while it acquired an average of just one annually. Congress finally took note and gave the sailing branch money to boost the build rate to a steady two boats a year starting in 2012. And that means there's going to be a big—but temporary—dip in submarine strength when the Los Angeles-class boats the Navy bought in the 1980s and mid-'90s finally age out. It'll take a few years for new Virginia-class vessels to replace them. The low point comes in 2028, when the Navy will have just 41 attack subs, 17 fewer than today. Since it takes around three submarines to guarantee that at least one is at sea and combat-ready at any given time that translates to roughly five fewer nuke boats poised to sink an invading fleet.What's more, it remains to be seen whether the Navy will be able to afford to build its new subs, especially as the expanding U.S. nuclear weapons budget threatens to cannibalize other Pentagon projects. According to the latest report from the Congressional Budget Office, \"the full annual cost of the 2015 shipbuilding plan would average $20.7 billion over the 2015-to-2044 period—32 percent more than the average annual funding the Navy has received in the past three decades.\"</td>\n",

And if grandparents and others do give the child money towards college, they’d better ask mom and dad how to send that money. While most parents want cash or a check, others want the money by other means, according to the survey of more than 500 parents ages 25 to 64.Five ways to give the grandkids money for collegePercentage of parents who say this is their preferred method of receiving college funds for their kids.Cash/check 28.30% Deposit into a 529 plan 25.90% General savings account 22.70% Savings bond 16.80% Exchange-traded fund 6.20% Source: Sallie Mae’s Upromise.Parents’ preference for college cash — rather than the physical gifts — makes a lot of sense, considering the now-astronomical cost of college. Indeed, the cost of college is rising rapidly -- Mark Kantrowitz, the senior vice president and publisher of Edvisors.com, says that parents of newborns should assume that the average cost of college over any 17-year period will go up by a factor of three from its current cost) — which means it may cost a child attending a four-year in-state college in 2031 (17 years from now) more than $220,000 for all four years.“The cost of college is continually rising and parents are very aware of this, but it’s hard for families [to save for college] as they also save for retirement and go through daily life,” says Erin Condon, the vice president of Upromise.Of course, students can get loans and scholarships, but this may be hard to count on as a way to fully fund education. From 2008 to 2012, the total debt at graduation increased an average of 6% each year, and more than seven in 10 college seniors who graduate have student loan debt, with an average debt of nearly $30,000 per borrower as of 2012, according to The Project on Student Debt.'Frozen' holiday battle: Anna vs. Elsa?Toy makers and retailers are betting on Disney's \"Frozen\" for a huge holiday season. But is it really a battle between Elsa and Anna?Also see: Parents, stop paying off your kids’ student loansThat’s one reason giving cash for college is so important — and can potentially make a meaningful impact down the road. Consider: If you give a child just $150 each holiday season towards college and do this from infancy through age 18, the child could have more than $4,000 towards college — and that’s assuming a modest 4% annual return on investment. Throw in a college donation at each birthday, and you could see that total double, though, of course, you’d have to invest the money somewhere (a 529 plan is a good option), as savings accounts these days don’t have high yields.On the flip side, let’s say the child has to borrow that $8,000 to pay for college. Considering that, as a rough rule of thumb, for every $1 a child borrows, she pays back $2, that $8,000 she had to borrow could cost her $16,000. So, give her $150 a year from the time she is an infant and she can spend that $8,000 on school and not have to repay it — or she may end up forking over $16,000 down the road.Of course, young kids probably don’t care much about a college donation and instead want to rip open a brand-new toy. That’s why some grandparents may want to buy one, less pricey physical gift and put the remaining money towards school (assuming, of course, that the family will likely need your financial help in paying for college and/or doesn’t need your money for a more pressing issue like a child’s medical costs). And don’t feel too guilty about not stuffing boxes under the Christmas tree: 60% of parents already think their kids are more spoiled than they were as children.Or — possibly better yet — resist the urge to buy physical gifts at all, remembering that, down the road, the child will probably thank you, as student-loan burdened graduates clearly aren’t pleased about the impact the debt has had on their lives. A survey released in October by Citizens Financial Group found that 47% of people who had attended college said they would have considered not going at all had they known the impact student loans would have on their lives, and more than half said that based on what they know today, they would not have financed their education with student loans.</td>\n",

He says he didn't notice a shadowy figure staring at his group from behind the trees until reviewing the photos later. However, in the video below, it seems clear that he and his colleague are a little freaked by loud, moaning vocalizations that can be heard. They sound like a cross between an elk bugle and the frustrated lament I made into the New Mexico sky one night years ago after watching the finale of Lost.Bird is something of an authority on Bigfoot in the UK. He says he first encountered evidence of the beast on a visit to Florida years ago and has been obsessed ever since. He co-founded a Bigfoot research organization in the UK and has reportedly worked with the Animal Planet show \"Finding Bigfoot\" for an upcoming episode.Sightings and interest in Bigfoot seem to have enjoyed a bit of an uptick recently, even with apparent hoaxes not holding up to DNA analysis earlier this year and the planned \"tour\" of a Bigfoot corpse also turning out to be a fraud.What do you think of the latest Bigfoot news?

In real life, we can put people to sleep almost instantly, but that generally requires either drugs or hitting the right pressure point, both of which are way less gentle than Doc’s small device.Self-lacing sneakersEarlier this year, Nike announced that it was actually going to manufacture self-lacing high tops, after they started selling the Air Mag design that Marty slips on as he’s trying to blend in with the future. Great news for everyone that hates bending over for more than three seconds at a time!Self-adjusting and drying jacketClothes were supposed to be way more convenient in 2015 all the way around, but companies just haven’t gotten around to manufacturing jackets that automatically adjust to your size (probably because doing so would cannibalize their business). We don’t have jackets that blow dry themselves, either, but there’s plenty of new water-resistant fabrics, so at least that’s something.Holographic moviesTrue, 3D movies had been around a long time even when Back to the Future Part II hit theaters, but they certainly didn’t resemble the sort of technology we have today. Though we don’t have the sort of tech that creates the illusion of massive sharks attacking us in the street, slipping on 3D glasses can certainly give that illusion. So, half a point!Soundboard vestOne of Griff’s thugs plays a chicken noise on his vest to mock Marty, though having a bulky vest that generates sounds is far dopier than anything McFly was wearing. This wouldn’t be very hard to make these days, given our microscopic digital technology, but hopefully no one decides to actually construct it.Hands-free video gamesMarty shows off his shooting skills to two youngsters (including a tiny Elijah Wood!) at the 80’s Cafe, but they’re none too impressed. “You mean you have to use your hands?” they mock. “That’s like a baby’s toy!”Though kids these days are still jamming their thumbs and swiping fingers, there are hands-free video games, including the motion sensor utilized in Microsoft’s Xbox Kinect. The Cubs winning the World SeriesThe victory by the perennially pathetic team is unexpected even in this version of 2015. The Cubbies still haven’t won a World Series in our reality, and unless they undergo a major roster overhaul, they’ll probably fall short next year, too.A Miami baseball teamMarty is less astounded by the Cubs’ win, however, than he is by the fact that it came over a baseball team from Miami. As it would turn out, the city got a team — the Marlins — just a few years after the film was released. But they would never face off in the World Series, because they’re both in the National League.A remote-controlled camera on a wireThe camera used by USA Today (seemingly the only news outlet in the movie’s 2015) to cover the crash at City Hall zips above, threaded to a wire strung across the plaza. It is quite reminiscent of the SkyCam, which was invented in 2009 and is now used in many televised sporting events to provide angles impossible by any human-operated camera.Fingerprint paymentMaybe Apple engineers have been watching Back to the Future for inspiration, because the thumbprint payment system is pretty similar to (if a bit more advanced than) Apple Pay, which will allow you to pay for items using your phone and fingerprint ID.Food hydratorA tiny Pizza Hut pizza is slipped into the Black &amp; Decker Food Hydrator and, a few seconds later, comes out as a full-size, very delicious-looking pie (the Pizza Hut company actually sent a chef to set to make sure the food looked palatable). We have very convenient dehydrators, but so far, no good way to hydrate food, a fact for which Seamless must be very grateful.Scenery TVIf you’re so inclined to watch hours of the same, boring scenery, it is very much available on DVD or YouTube. It’s also a hit program in Norway.Video conferencingSkype, FaceChat and every incredibly complex office conferencing system pretty much nailed this one. Thankfully, people can’t just turn on the screen and catch you unawares — unless they’re hackers.Multi-screen TVCable was just at its ascent back in 1989, when Back to the Future Part II was released, which must have inspired this big screen with lots of different channels playing at once. Picture-in-picture has been standard on TVs for years, and as any subscriber to NFL Sunday Ticket will tell you, it’s possible to fill a screen with an endless array of different programs. This is where ADD was born. Video glassesMarty Jr. and his sister — also played by Michael J. Fox — spend their time at the dinner table behind a pair of digital glasses, watching TV and answering the phone through their clunky shades. Now, early adapters and weirdos have access to Google Glass, which more or less allows people to do all the same things as those TV glasses, without the sweet style.Rejuvenation clinicDoc rips off his “mask” early in the film, to reveal the results of his trip to a rejuvenation clinic, which replaced his spleen and colon, fixed his wrinkles, and added a few decades to his life. In reality, we’re not there yet, though plenty of shady “pharmaceutical” companies and “life-extension” clinics promise similar results.Upside down floating “chair”Another sweet development for the elderly was this upside-down floating device used by old George McFly (whose face is inexplicably white, despite the fact that all the blood should have rushed to his head). Sadly, this looks a long ways away for us.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Hillary Clinton can't keep her story straight. I'm not talking about her email servers. She can't stick to a consistent line on the rather more central issue of the U.S. economy. It is leading to odd tonal shifts in her campaign, and to some foolish policy choices, too.It's not entirely her fault. The last two Democratic presidents had comparatively simple tasks when designing their economic messages. Bill Clinton could run against 12 years of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, especially since the country still thought it was in a recession when he ran. Barack Obama could say the economy was in crisis mostly because of George W. Bush and secondarily because of decades of conservative policies.Hillary Clinton has a harder task. She can't simply celebrate today's economy as the product of Democratic policies, because people aren't thrilled with it. She can't blame the economy's inadequacy on a Republican administration, because there hasn't been one for six and a half years. She can't say that the economy is subpar because of decades of bad policy choices, either: That period includes 16 years of Democratic presidencies, including her husband's, and she wants to associate herself with the prosperity of Bill's time in office.Her solution has been to do all of these things at once. Terrible trends started around 1981 and the Democrats have made things better when they've been in charge and we have a good economy again and we need to change everything we've been doing for a long time. She sounded each of these notes in recent speeches at the New School and New York University.The most consistent story she could tell would be that everything went wrong with Reagan. A lot of liberal thinkers have invested their intellectual labor in this story. Her argument would be that Reagan unraveled the postwar bargain between government, labor and business — weakening the first two forces and strengthening the third — and that the result has been stagnation or worse for most American workers.This explanation seems to dominate the Clinton campaign's economic thinking. It informs her latest proposal, which is to hike capital gains taxes except for very long-term investments. It lies beneath her complaints about the weakness of labor unions, too.But the story doesn't really fit the facts. The booms of the 1980s and 1990s benefited most Americans, with compensation rising and most people saying they were satisfied with how things were going. The decline of unions was not mostly the result of Reaganite hostility: It's a trend that was already under way when John F. Kennedy was president, and seems to have had a lot to do with the inability of unionized companies to compete with nonunionized ones.Perhaps worse from a political perspective, that story also makes Bill Clinton appear to have been ineffectual in protecting American workers from conservatism — or, worse, to have collaborated with it. Viewing the Reagan-Bush and Clinton policies today, there seems to be more continuity than difference. Trade grew freer, unions declined and inequality grew under all three of them (and beyond their presidencies). Bill Clinton even cut the capital-gains tax that Hillary Clinton now seeks to raise.Reconciling all these conflicting economic messages would tax even the most skillful of politicians. The Democrats are lucky that Hillary Clinton is such a natural.Ramesh Ponnuru is a Bloomberg View columnist.</td>\n",

              "      <td>View Enlarged ImageAs of Thursday morning, Jennifer Palmieri was employed as communications director for the Hillary Clinton campaign. Whether she still has that job on Friday morning after indicting her boss' qualifications to be president remains to be seen.On Wednesday, Palmieri appeared on Bloomberg Television's \"With All Due Respect,\" where she told co-host John Heilemann that Clinton \"didn't really think it through \" when she decided to use her personal email account for State Department business.Yes, just what America needs — a president and commander in chief who has a history of not really thinking through important decisions that can have an impact on national security.Of all the things we've heard and learned this week about the Clinton email scandal, Palmieri's statement is the most revealing. When a trusted aide admits her boss, who craves the presidency and all its power, has used poor judgment in a critical situation, the public should take note. This isn't a Republican saying this, or a Democratic challenger. It's from someone who, presumably, is in close association with Clinton every day and has been for some time. It's from someone who's observed the former secretary of state operate in public and private and has inside information that few have.Palmieri, a veteran of both the Clinton and Obama White Houses, of course did not mean for her statement to be an indictment of Clinton. She was merely doing what communications directors do when their bosses get in trouble — try to make it seem as if the trouble isn't really so bad.Often spokesmen will invent \"facts\" and dream up the overwhelming circumstances that led a politician into a tight spot. But whether she intended to condemn her boss or not, Palmieri is nevertheless right: Clearly Clinton \"didn't really think it through.\"Clinton has enough trouble without her allies giving her more. Each day brings a new set of problems related to her personal email account and private server. Just in the last day we've learned that the investigation into her personal email account is likely to widen and will probably grow beyond merely emails and into what type of device she used for State Department business. It appears that she used personal devices rather than State Department-issued devices that are more secure.Didn't think it through. Poor judgment. What difference does it make?Quite a lot, if the person who isn't thinking clearly and can't make good decisions is president of the United States. We don't believe the country needs someone who doesn't really think it through when she gets that 3 a.m. phone call.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Photo Credit: iStockA few months ago, I made the big decision to stop taking my birth control pills after almost 10 full years. It wasn’t because I stopped having sex or because I decided I wanted to try getting pregnant, or even because I wanted to try something different. It was because my birth control pills almost ruined my relationship, and they messed me up so much that I still can’t imagine ever taking them again.If you’re skeptical of how birth control pills can almost ruin a relationship, then I kind of envy you, because you’ve obviously never experienced what I did. My birth control pills toyed with my emotions so badly that they made me feel like a different person. For over a year, I barely felt like myself.There were times when I was “normal,” but there were more times when I was outrageously angry over nothing, so depressed I considered taking drastic measures, and so frustratingly anxious that it made me act completely out of character. I had no control over my emotions, and it was a horrible feeling—and something that almost drove my boyfriend away for good.My birth control pills weren’t always my worst enemies in tiny pill form. I went on the Pill at 16-years-old, when I was in a serious relationship with my first boyfriend, and my mom insisted I go on them “just in case” (in retrospect, thanks Mom—that was a pretty awesome move).Related: 30 Things Smart Women Know By The Time They’re 30It cleared up almost all of my stubborn acne, it helped me have a regular menstrual cycle for the first time, well, ever, and it eased the incredibly painful cramps I had once gotten every single month without fail. Cramps that had once kept me in bed crying in pain were gone, I wasn’t worried about getting pregnant, and my boobs got a little bigger (OK, this may have been a coincidence). I loved the birth control pill.I stayed on that same pill through college, when out of nowhere, my health insurance dropped the coverage of that brand. After a failed attempt with the generic brand, I went on a short break from the Pill for a few months.When I met my current boyfriend, I tried to go back on my old, trusty pill, but even my new health insurance didn’t cover it. My gynecologist suggested a similar option, so I tried it, figuring I had nothing to lose.At first, this pill worked fine. It wasn’t the same as my first pill, but it wasn’t terrible either. Then, out of nowhere, things became a little different. I couldn’t tell you exactly when it started, but at some point, I realized a horrible attitude every time I was PMSing replaced my crippling cramps. I felt irrationally angry over almost nothing at all—someone could speak to me in the wrong tone of voice, and I would feel the urge to punch them in the face wash over me.As a normally calm person, this violent reaction made me feel uneasy. I took my anger out on the people closest to me, like my family members and my boyfriend. I picked fights with him over nothing, just to enjoy the feeling of yelling at someone.It wasn’t just the uncontrollable anger. I was sad, really, really sad, and not only when I was PMSing. At random times, I felt heavy waves of depression fall over me. I would cry myself to sleep over a comment taken the wrong way, or my friends would be too busy to hang out, and I would feel devastatingly lonely.Sometimes I felt so miserable that I wondered what it would be like if I just wasn’t around. I had a good job, a great boyfriend, an amazing family, friends who cared about me, and everything else I could have wanted—there was no reason for depression.On top of the anger and depression, I felt anxious about everything. I mostly took this anxiety out on my boyfriend in the form of jealousy. I became wildly jealous over everything he did without me. Despite the fact that he had never gone behind my back to hurt me, or given me a reason to distrust him, I was suspicious of his every move.I looked at his text messages when he wasn’t in the room, I questioned him repeatedly, and I called him over and over again when he wouldn’t answer. I knew I was being irrational, difficult, and controlling, but at the same time, I felt like I couldn’t stop. Sometimes I would do things, and later when I was feeling more myself, I would look back on them as if watching a movie of someone else doing them. It was a horrible feeling.As I’m sure you can imagine, my relationship was suffering. My boyfriend couldn’t understand why I didn’t trust him, why nothing he said made me feel like I could count on him—and honestly, I couldn’t understand it either.He hated the questioning, he didn’t know how to deal with the mood swings (which went from furious to crying to laughing to furious again), and he felt like I was a different person. He wasn’t the only one who felt that way.Related: 11 Signs The Girl You Love Is A KeeperAfter a few months of this, I finally started to wonder if maybe it was my birth control. The thought had never occurred to me before, because no one had ever warned me of emotional side effects like these.I had heard that the Pill could maybe make you gain weight, cause a blood clot, or make you bloated, but I had never heard that it could make you feel like a stranger in your own body. I doubted myself, but at the same time, I considered switching pills.Things got worse in my relationship. My boyfriend and I were mad at each other all the time. I refused to give him the space he needed, and he pulled away from me. I told him I thought it might be the pill, and one day, he finally gave me an ultimatum: try a different pill, or we’d break up.This was the best relationship I had ever been in, a relationship I could see lasting for a very long time. I realized then that my emotions were ruining all of the good things we had once had together, and I wanted those good things back.I did switch pills, and after a few weeks, I felt like my normal self again. I didn’t feel violently angry towards people I barely interacted with. I stopped picking fights with my boyfriend, and my trust in him returned—I no longer felt worried about everything he did. Things with us improved almost immediately.In the end, the pills I switched to helped me emotionally, but had some annoying physical side effects. When my gynecologist told me she worried about blood clots, she also basically told me I had to switch pills again. I tried one more time, but after a few months, I felt myself getting out of control again, and I thought, that’s it—I’m done.I’ve been off birth control pills for a few months now, and I really feel like it was the best decision I ever could have made. I still get sad or frustrated when I’m PMSing, but I don’t feel out of control, and I don’t feel completely and totally irrational.My terrible cramps have returned, my cycle is irregular again, and I of course have to worry about an unwanted pregnancy, but you know what? It’s worth it.I don’t feel like a stranger, my boyfriend and I are very happy, and I have control over my feelings again. I wouldn’t trade that for birth control pills no matter how hard a gynecologist would try to convince me.More from YourTango: My Wife’s Depression Almost Ended Our Marriage 7 Incredible Ways Love Transforms Your Brain 15 Ways He Says He Loves You (Without Actually Saying It)</td>\n",

              "      <td>If US Honda was a bakery, it'd be like this: The shelves are full of bread, all pretty good and readily available, but nothing special. But sometimes you'd see an amazing cupcake on the shelf, incredibly detailed and looking like nothing you've ever seen. When you ask to buy it, the guy behind the counter smiles and crushes it in his fist.That's Honda in America. Sure, there's nothing exactly wrong with the cars they sell here, but almost all of them — perhaps with the exception of the new Fit — are anonymous, committee-designed competency-boxes that my dentist shows me pictures of to put me under before extracting a handful of bicuspids.But then I see things like Honda's newly announced N-Box Slash (or N/). It's the latest version of their little N-Box Kei car line, and it's pretty much exactly what I want from a modern car. It's fantastic on space utilization, it doesn't look like every other thing on the road, it seems flexible and practical, the design — interior and exterior — manages to have a sense of fun without being ridiculous, and it seems like a comfortable, efficient and practical way to go about that 80% of driving that is utilitarian without being bored to tears.I love this thing. Just look at these design options you get for the interior theme of the car: Tennessee Session (lots of wood, dark leather), California Diner (red leather, checkerboard), Hawaii Glide (yellow exterior, pale blue interior with stripes), Street Rod, Bright Rod — these variants in color, materials, and trim go a long way to giving the same car a range of characters, and they all seem far too much fun for American Honda to even consider offering.The exterior is a classic Kei-car one-box design, but with a sort of chop-top/short greenhouse look to make it a look a little less like something from a Richard Scarry book. The side window line —specifically that upward kick of the rear side windows — seems to be a little bit of a shout-out to the old Honda Z600.Most US-based automotive sites are saying it's a 'retro' look, which I disagree with, but this is a very telling description. The design is quite modern, really, certainly more so than its brother, the N-One, which has a front end definitely inspired by the old Honda N600 of the '60s and early '70s. The N-Box Slash isn't like that — it's not trying to mimic designs of the past, but it does share one key thing with past designs that Honda (along with most carmakers) have lost — a sense of fun.I think it's being called 'retro' because it's not trying to be another cookie-cutter aspirational design. I think we haven't seen this in modern cars for so long (outside of actual retro designs like the Fiat 500, Mini, or Beetle) that we just assume the idea is from the past. It doesn't have to be.The Honda N-Box Slash is Kei car compliant, which means it's quite small, and has an engine that's 600cc/64 HP max. Sure, that's probably not going to fly in the US, but I'd still love to see a slightly uprated version of a car like this make it to our shores. Maybe it'd have to be scaled up.Though, if Honda could figure out a way to get, say, a 1.5L engine in there and meet US crash regs, it could help free Honda from the \"Galapagos\" trap of their current Kei cars. See, all Kei cars are basically like Galapagos turtles, in that they can only exist in Japan, like those giant tortoises only exist on the Galapagos islands. Maybe there could be a wider market for clever, space-efficient cars outside of the Home Islands?Of course, I'm probably just dreaming. The N-Box Slash probably wouldn't sell that much over here. But I still can't shake my desire for a small, fun, useful car like this, something with acres more character than a Yaris or a Mirage, and even more usable than a Fiat 500.I guess I'll have to hold on to that old 1st-gen xB a little longer, and hope someone at Honda decides to take a risk.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Why do relationships deteriorate over time? What causes people to disconnect and drift apart? I'm not just talking about intimate relationships between married couples and partners; I'm talking about all relationships. What is causing this epidemic of disconnection? Why can't we maintain a deep connection with the people in our lives?I'll tell you why. It's because we are all lying, hiding and keeping secrets from everyone in our lives, thinking it's what we're meant to do. We use the excuse that if we tell people what we really think, we may hurt their feelings or get into trouble. So instead, we don't express ourselves, we keep our real thoughts secret and ultimately hide our true selves from the people we care about most. In other words, no one is being authentic in relationships.Now, don't be offended that I just called you a liar and a secret keeper. The good news is you're not alone. Look at the people around you. They have just as many secrets as you do. Maybe even more. Yes, everyone has secrets and many people don't think keeping a secret is a big deal, but it is a big deal. Here's why.1) Secrets create reality. Most people believe that if you hide something, then it doesn't really exist. It's just a hidden secret or thought in your mind. It's not real, it has no impact, and it means nothing. That's a lie. The act of making a secret and hiding it is what makes it real. If you have to hide information, it gives it a level of importance and property. It actually does the opposite of what you want it to do. Instead of the secret disappearing because you're not telling, it becomes very real, affecting your relationships, happiness and keeping you stuck in a \"purgatory\" that you don't even know you're in.2) Secrets hide the real you. What makes up a secret? It's something you can't tell. It's something you aren't allowed to talk about. It's something that will get you in trouble. It's something that you are ashamed or embarrassed about. There are big secrets and little secrets. Many people can grasp how keeping a big secret, like cheating on a spouse, is significant and would impact a person. What about the little secrets? Are they significant? Every secret is significant.For example, I had a client, we'll call him Peter, who was seriously dating a woman. During their first year together, she put on about 20 pounds. She would ask him all the time how she looked and said she wanted him to tell the truth. He didn't want to tell her how he really felt which was that she had gotten heavy. Instead, he lied and told her she looked great. The more she would ask, the more he would lie and not tell her what he really thought. Slowly, he started to become less attracted to her. Then he felt guilty for being \"so shallow\" about her weight. And then he became aware of how much he picked on her in his head about her weight and started obsessing about it. His secret started to really take shape and become real. It even got to a point where he was no longer physically aroused by her. Peter thought he was having erectile issues, but they were really secret issues.3) Secrets manifest problems elsewhere. Somewhere along the way it became okay for people to be secret keepers. The problem is, we don't realize the big impact secrets have on our relationships or ourselves. You cannot be deeply connected with someone if you're withholding your true thoughts and feelings. In the example above, Peter's relationship deteriorated because he was afraid to tell the truth to his girlfriend. Plus his secret impacted him emotionally and physically. It wasn't until he looked at what he was hiding from his girlfriend that he was able to connect his secret to his erectile dysfunction. 4) Secrets wreck relationships. People don't realize that their secrets are why their marriage ended or the reason they don't get along with their boss. Often, when a relationship falls apart, a person will just explain what happens, saying they've \"fallen out of love\" with the other person or \"it just didn't work out.\" They almost never ask the question: what was I hiding? What secrets was I keeping? People rarely own up that they were the source of the disconnection. Instead they hunt for their own innocence and play the victim, pointing the finger at what the other person did wrong.5) Secrets isolate you from the most important people in your life. I have never met a person who feels totally free to tell anyone anything or express what they really think. Most people live in their own little private, secret world where they spend most of their time managing what they are saying. It's pretty lonely in there. When I coach a person, one of the first things I do is have them get all their secrets out of their head and onto paper. Why? Because their secrets are what keeps them separate from the people in their lives and they don't even know it. Keeping secrets makes you think you know how things are, and if you already know, you don't investigate with the other living, breathing humans around you. This robs you of real communication and intimacy.When you don't say what you really think, people can't know who you really are. Therefore, you'll never feel loved for who you really are. So, how do you stop the secret keeping that is killing your relationships and covering up the real you? Very carefully. Don't just go blurting your nasty thoughts to people. Seek help in how to begin communicating honestly. There is a formula to having this go well and you're going to require practice. If you want your relationships to survive, even thrive, this is one of the most important skills to develop. Let us know if we can help.Love, Lauren</td>\n",

              "      <td>NeNe Leakes new show Fab Gab made its debut this week, giving fans another way to keep up with the Real Housewives of Atlanta star. The first episode featured The View co-host Whoopi Goldberg, and her rather impressive shoe collection — one that impressed the very well-heeled NeNe.“I am a shoe person, but I have met my damn match, honey.”Fab Gab will be airing weekly on Leakes’ website, NeNe Leaks Official. WetPaint states that the five-minute show “isn’t exactly inspired webisode content” — but for NeNe’s fans, it’s entertaining to watch her chat it up with other celebs.“I met up with Whoopi Goldberg in her shoe closet to talk everything from her obsession with fabulous shoes… She also gifted me with the most fabulous shoes, hunni! And here I was thinking I was killing the shoe game… well I’ve met my match!”Whoopi talks about her footwear obsession with NeNe and reveals that she loves “unusual shoes” — if you like shoes, it’s worth taking a peek at Whoopi’s dressing room at The View. Her wall-to-wall shoe collection rivals any of the Real Housewives‘ closets, leaving fans to wonder what her shoe closet looks like at home.When asked if designers give her the shoes in her collection, Whoopi stated that she buys all her own shoes, and there were some that she hadn’t even worn yet, including an amazing pair of Christian Louboutins.NeNe went right from shoes to asking Whoopie if she enjoys cocktails after work — a strange transition, but hey, it’s NeNe’s show and it’s only five minutes, so it’s not surprising that she crammed in two completely different topics on the debut of her online show.“When you’re not working at The View what do you do? Do you have a cocktail?” Leakes asked Goldberg. The answer was a resounding “no” with Whoopi telling NeNe that she “used to” drink but doesn’t anymore because she “likes her life” and doesn’t want to do that anymore.From shoes to cocktails, NeNe Leakes‘ mini-talk show will be airing weekly online. There’s no word on who the next guest on FabGab will be, but fans can expect it to be a fast and entertaining spot, perfect to view on a lunch break or when you need a fix from the reality star who truly has the gift of gab.[Image: NeNe Leakes Official]</td>\n",

              "      <td>The Speech That Could Make Elizabeth Warren the Next President of the United States</td>\n",
              "      <td>Early Friday evening Sen. Elizabeth Warren took to the Senate floor and gave a plain-spoken, barn-burning speech that could make history and put her into serious contention to be the next President of the United States.There are only a handful of political speeches that have such historic impact. Barack Obama's keynote speech at the 2004 Democratic Convention comes readily to mind. It's what catapulted an obscure Illinois state Senator into the national limelight and put him on the path to becoming President.Warren's Senate speech was different, but just as electrifying.Obama's rhetoric was lofty, high-minded, and general, with a feel-good unifying message that there's no blue America or red America but only the United States of America.Warren's rhetoric is more down to earth, substantive, and frankly, angrier, unafraid of calling out by name the institutions--the big banks and Citigroup in particular--which tanked the economy, cost millions of Americans their jobs and homes, were bailed out with half a trillion dollars of taxpayer money, and then used their fortunes to buy Congress and make it more likely they'll be bailed out again. Moreover, she was unafraid to take on the President of her own party, and the numerous members of his administration drawn from Citigroup and other big banks through the endless revolving door between Washington and Wall Street.Here's the heart of Warren's speech:Democrats don't like Wall Street bailouts. Republicans don't like Wall Street bailouts. The American people are disgusted by Wall Street bailouts And yet here we are, five years after Dodd-Frank with Congress on the verge of ramming through a provision that would do nothing for the middle class, do nothing for community banks, do nothing but raise the risk that taxpayers will have to bail out the biggest banks once again... So let me say this to anyone who is listening at Citi[group]. I agree with you Dodd-Frank isn't perfect. It should have broken you into pieces! If this Congress is going to open up Dodd-Frank in the months ahead, then let's open it up to get tougher, not to create more bailout opportunities. If we're going to open up Dodd-Frank, let's open it up so that once and for all we end too big to fail and I mean really end it, not just say that we did. Instead of passing laws that create new bailout opportunities for too big to fail banks, let's pass... something... that would help break up these giant banks. A century ago Teddy Roosevelt was America's Trust-Buster. He went after the giant trusts and monopolies in this country, and a lot of people talk about how those trust deserved to be broken up because they had too much economic power. But Teddy Roosevelt said we should break them up because they had too much political power. Teddy Roosevelt said break them up because all that concentrated power threatens the very foundations of our democratic system. And now we're watching as Congress passes yet another provision that was written by lobbyists for the biggest recipient of bailout money in the history of this country. And its attached to a bill that needs to pass or else the entire federal government will grind to a halt. Think about that kind of power. If a financial institution has become so big and so powerful that it can hold the entire country hostage. That alone is reason enough to break them up. Enough is enough. Enough is enough with Wall Street insiders getting key position after key position and the kind of cronyism that we have seen in the executive branch. Enough is enough with Citigroup passing 11th hour deregulatory provisions that nobody takes ownership over but everybody will come to regret. Enough is enough Washington already works really well for the billionaires and the big corporations and the lawyers and the lobbyists. But what about the families who lost their homes or their jobs or their retirement savings the last time Citigroup bet big on derivatives and lost? What about the families who are living paycheck to paycheck and saw their tax dollars go to bail out Citi just 6 years ago? We were sent here to fight for those families. It is time, it is past time, for Washington to start working for them!Please take less than 10 minutes of your time to watch the speech below. Like Obama's 2004 Convention speech, it was an historic speech, a potentially game changing speech. It catapulted Warren from a potential nuisance to Hillary Clinton's coronation as the Democratic nominee to someone who could foreseeably win the nomination and even the Presidency.It transformed the conventional wisdom about American politics that the main divide is between left, right, and center, when it is really between pro-corporate and anti-corporate. Her declaration that neither Democrats nor Republicans (meaning the voters, not the Washington politicians) don't like bank bailouts rings loud and true. Tea party supporters don't like bailouts and crony capitalism any more that progressives do.The conventional wisdom is that to win white working and middle class voters, politicians need to move towards the center, meaning towards a more corporate approach. But in a world of growing inequality, stagnating wages, and a fading belief that with hard work your children can have a better life than you had, that may no longer be true.Hillary Clinton represents the old politics of the status quo and accommodation to Wall Street's power. Her husband's Treasury Secretary was former Goldman Sachs exec Robert Rubin. After leading Pres. Clinton's effort to dismantle the half-century old Glass-Steagel prohibition on government-insured commercial banks engaging in risky speculative bets which enabled the creation of financial megaliths like Citigroup, he went on to earn $126 million as a senior executive for Citigroup and brokered Citigroup's ½ Trillion Dollar bailout. His protégé, Timothy Geithner became Barack Obama's Treasury Secretary where he opposed breaking up the big banks who had cratered the economy.Elizabeth Warren represents a new politics in which, by challenging the power of the oligarchy, she has the potential of reclaiming the white working class for Democrats and uniting them with the coalition of professionals, single women, gays and minorities who elected Obama. She is the first major national politician in decades who is willing to openly challenge the power of the Wall Street oligarchy, in the manner of Franklin Delano Roosevelt who declared, \"They are unanimous in their hate for me -- and I welcome their hatred.\"With the increasingly dominant power of big money in politics, could Warren defeat Clinton, Inc. and then go on to defeat what is likely to be the near unanimous support of the Wall Street and corporate elite for her Republican opponent? It's hard to say. But the nation is in too much trouble to settle for a Democratic or Republican candidate of the corporatist status quo. If there's any hope, it's that once in a while the power of organized people can defeat the power of organized money. Elizabeth Warren represents that hope and it's the only thing worth hoping for.Watch Warren's 9:43 second speech below. If you're fed up with the power of Wall Street and the big banks, it will inspire you. And even if you aren't, watch it for its importance as a model of historically transformative political rhetoric.</td>\n",

              "      <td>A Kentucky mom shared her frustrations with a local high school's dress code after her daughter was allegedly sent to the principal's office for wearing an outfit that revealed her collarbone. Mom Stacie Dunn posted a photo of her daughter Stephanie on the first day of school wearing the \"inappropriate\" outfit in question.In the caption, she wrote, \"So this is my daughter at school today. I had to come to the school because according to her school principal what she is wearing is out of dress code and inappropriate for school.\"Dunn said that when she arrived at the school, she saw a group of female students in the principal's office for similar dress code violations. \"This is ridiculous! WOODFORD County High School and the principle have been enforcing a dress code where as girls can not show even there collar bones [sic] because it may distract their male class mates,\" she wrote on Facebook. \"Parents are being called away from their important jobs and students are missing important class time because they are showing their collarbones! Something needs to change!\"After receiving a phone call from the school about Stephanie's dress code violation, Dunn brought her daughter a scarf to wear. But the saga continued when the outfit was still deemed inappropriate, and the teen was ultimately sent home after \"giving the principal an attitude,\" the mom claims in a follow-up Facebook post.The following day, the mom launched a petition to help Stephanie and her fellow students change their school's dress code. It currently has over 4,300 signtatures.Woodford County High School's 10-year-old dress code has been a source of tension in the past. In March, student Maggie Sunseri released a documentary featuring a series of interviews with female students, as well as the school principal, Rob Akers.Titled \"Shame: A Documentary on School Dress Code,\" the 33-minute film highlights some of the students' issues with the dress code, which mandates that shirts cover their collarbones and that shorts and skirts to be knee-length or longer.Though Stacie Dunn's daughter Stephanie is not featured in the film, the girls interviewed express the same kinds of concerns she shared this week. They say they feel embarrassed and ashamed about being \"called out\" for \"revealing\" outfits that show their collarbones, that it's difficult to find acceptable clothes for schools, that the rules are not uniformly enforced and that it's absurd to be forced to missed class because of these unfair standards.As a result, they say they feel distracted with worry about whether or not each teacher will deem their outfits appropriate and fear that they may be humiliated. In the documentary, Principal Akers cites removing distraction as a motivating factor behind dress codes, though he adds he was not at Woodford County High School when this particular policy was implemented during the 2004-05 school year. In his past experience as an administrator, he says, \"issues with sexual harassment\" among students prompted stricter dress codes.\"Certain outfits that [female students] wore created this situation where guys would make inappropriate statements, and there was a distraction to the learning environment based on what some of the folks were wearing at school,\" he says in the film.But the girls believe that it's unfair to limit female students' clothing options instead of addressing the harassment issues more directly with male students. \"It sends the message to boys that it's all girls' fault, basically -- any reaction or any action that they do is the girl's fault,\" one girl says in the film. \"It wasn't their fault that they were staring or got distracted. It's the girls' fault.\"In an interview with The Huffington Post this week, Sunseri said the inspiration behind her film and her opposition to the dress code \"has little to do with clothing and more to do with the underlying message behind a code that tells young women to cover up and young boys that they can't control themselves.\" The 16-year-old high school junior said the dress code is sexist toward both girls and boys in that it \"perpetuates the notion that a woman's body is inherently more sexual than a man's body, and that young boys' natural tendencies are to harass or assault women.\"Sunseri added that she believes this is a widespread problem in schools and greater society across the nation, not just at Woodford County High School. \"This is a time when we are already trying to figure out our place in the world, and on top of that we are made to feel guilty about the body parts we were born with.\"Principal Akers told HuffPost in response to last week's incident that his school's dress code is not about \"sexualizing the collarbone\" but having \"measurable\" metrics that allow the rules to be applied fairly. He also added that he's always been open to discussing students' concerns and making adjustments to the rules but that no one has ever tried to meet with him.Until now. Since the recent incident with Stacie Dunn and her daughter Stephanie, Sunseri has come forward with a proposal for a new dress code. After making small changes to the proposal in a meeting with Principal Akers', she presented it at a school meeting on August 17 in front of a council of parents, teachers and administrators. According to Akers and Sunseri, the council moved the proposal to a committee for review and asked the junior to put together a group of students to join the committee in this task. Then, the council as a whole will consider a proposal from the committee at the next meeting on September 21. Sunseri's proposed dress code, which she considers an exercise in compromise, would allow for sleeveless shirts with straps that are at least three fingertips wide, skirts and dresses that meet the \"fingertip rule\" for length and shirts that meet the \"credit card rule\" -- a credit card length from the bottom of the throat to the top of the shirt. The rules would also permit leggings and yoga pants as long as a top covered the front and back sides. If passed, the code would go into effect in January. Stacie Dunn expressed her joy at the prospect for real change in a Facebook post. \"Hopefully the outcome will be favorable!\" she wrote. Principal Akers told HuffPost that he applauds Sunseri's initiative, both in making the documentary and following through with tangible action. \"Everyone always wanted the dress code to change, but no one was willing to do anything about it,\" Sunseri said in her interview, adding, \"I hope that anyone reading my story feels empowered to go out and make changes within their own community.\"H/T Today</td>\n",

              "      <td>Every Jobs Day during the past recession, and for several years after, Bill McBride of the blog Calculated Risk compiled what Business Insider came to call \"the scariest jobs chart ever,\" a comparison of the payroll employment trajectories during every recession since World War II. He made the last one after the May 2014 jobs report, when employment finally rose above its pre-recession peak. It looked like this:In short, it was a really bad recession, far and away the worst since the 1930s.QuickTake Monthly U.S. Jobs ReportBut what about the recovery? How's that going? I took the opportunity of today's jobs data release to compare the growth in payroll employment since it bottomed out in February 2010 with the growth in payroll employment after past recessions.For the sake of readability I didn't chart every recovery since World War II, going instead with the five most recent -- skipping the one that began in July 1980 because it only lasted 12 months. And I date my recoveries from the month when employment hit bottom, which doesn't always coincide with the recession dates set by the National Bureau of Economic Research. The NBER says the first recession of the new millennium ended in November 2001, but payroll employment didn't start rising until late 2003.The clearest takeaway here is that the current jobs recovery looks an awful lot like the last two -- much slower and steadier than the boom of the Reagan years and the even steeper and more erratic rise during the Ford and Carter presidencies. Look at McBride's chart and you can see that the pre-1975 recoveries were similarly steep. Something changed after the 1980s; my guess is that it was some combination of the disappearance of manufacturing jobs -- which tended to be cut back sharply in a recession and added back rapidly during the subsequent rebound -- and an increasing corporate focus on productivity, driven by pressure from Wall Street, that has made managers wary of hiring even when the economy improves. This may be the wrong way to look at it. Because the last recession was so much more severe than the previous two, there was much more ground to regain this time around -- and as my colleague Mark Whitehouse pointed out this morning, we're still a couple million jobs away from regaining it. There are those who argue that state and federal fiscal austerity have weighed on job growth since the recession; there are also those who argue that new \"subsidies and regulations intended to help the poor and unemployed\" have perversely held back the recovery.Still, I think it is worth dwelling on how the current jobs recovery is unfolding at almost exactly the same pace as the last two. Maybe this is just the way the job market works now. And while the recovery that began in 2003 is now seen as something of a bust, the 1990s are looked back upon fondly as a time of widespread prosperity. That's because the 2000s jobs recovery didn't last very long -- as you can see from the above chart, it had already given way to a new recession by this point. The 1990s version, meanwhile, went on and on and on.So that's really the key. If the economy keeps adding 200,000 jobs a month for the rest of this year, and next year, and the year after that, this will start looking like a pretty great economic recovery. But we're not there yet.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.To contact the author on this story: Justin Fox at justinfox@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor on this story: James Greiff at jgreiff@bloomberg.net</td>\n",

I've been #EatenAlive by exactly as many anacondas as the host of this ridiculous show? — David Shiffman (@WhySharksMatter) December 8, 2014This was probably not what Discovery had in mind when, early on in the telecast, it tweeted:Last month, Discovery and Paul Rosolie had asked the media to swallow a whopper — Rosolie would attempt to be eaten alive by an anaconda, for all the anacondas out there who have no voice. Some bit.In Eaten Alive, Rosolie said, he would attempt to be swallowed by a 25-to-27-foot anaconda “that slippedthrough his hands and nearly dragged him to the bottom of the floating forest” that happened “on his one and only previous expedition to this secluded part of the Amazonian jungle.” But one hour and 40 minutes into the two-hour special, Rosolie was seen failing entirely to capture that anaconda, and they instead had to use some understudy welterweight anaconda they had lying around because, Rosolie explained, he was still intent upon getting crushed and swallowed by an anaconda, for the sake of the snakes.While failing to produce much drama, the special did cough up some great anaconda-theme ads, including a Man Up Moment repeat of a moment during the special in which Rosolie dives into the water in pursuit of a snake — brought to you by Every Kiss Begins with Kay Jewelers —  as well as an ad mocking the show while plugging  an online contact lens store. That company nicked the show again in its own tweet after the telecast was over:In its news release, Discovery Channel described Rosolie “as snake researcher and conservationist… who has dedicated his career to studying the Giant Green Anaconda.”In an interview with adventure travel web site Curious Animal, published May 16, 2014, Rosolie described thusly his research and conservation work on the world’s largest anaconda:“I have a six-foot arm span and I jumped on a snake where I couldn’t wrap my arms around the snake. That’s a giant snake…She kept moving with me on her back, so I was riding an anaconda and she didn’t even seem to mind.”Rosolie said he was in “extreme danger” when he hitched a ride on the back of the snake — for research purposes, we now know– adding, “I don’t know why I jumped on it, except I was so excited and amazed to see an animal like that. I think I just needed that experience of getting to touch it.”Last month, while Discovery Channel said Rosolie would “attempt something no one has ever dared: to be EATEN ALIVE,” Rosolie himself floated his “I did it for the Rain Forest and all its living creatures” defense:“I’ve seen first-hand how the Amazon Rainforest is being destroyed. It is so rampant that we may be the last generation with the opportunity to save it. People need to wake up to what is going on. What better way is there to shock people than to put my life on the line with the largest snake on the planet, the Green Anaconda?” he asked rhetorically, since he’d previously been compelled to reveal the stunt already had been shot, and the snake had survived his publicity stunt, in response to the growing din of critics. Discovery Channel tried to drown that din, by announcing that the anaconda that attempted to dine on Rosolie was alive and well. Discovery added that the Lumpy Ninja get-up Rosolie wore during his attempt to force himself, meal-wise, on the snake who was just minding her own business in the floating forest, was “built to ensure the snake’s safety just as much as it was to protect Rosolie’s life.” This, in response to nearly 38,000 signatures on a Change.org petition to persuade Discovery Communications to dump this special it describes as made-for-TV animal abuse.

Well, it's pretty simple. He can play center field, and do it pretty well.Sure, Delino DeShields is the starting center fielder for this club, but he hits right-handed. DeShields has earned the right to be more than a platoon option, and he'll remain the starter in center, but Leonys Martin is trying to play through a cracked hamate bone and won't be an option in Arlington anymore, and Josh Hamilton shouldn't play in center given his fragility. Hamilton will miss his fourth straight game on Wednesday with a sore knee and also is no lock to play left field, which Venable can also do.Hamilton Hopes to Return in DetroitSo who is Will Venable? Well, he's batting .258/.318/.378 with 10 doubles, three triples and six homers to go with 30 RBIs and 11 stolen bases in 98 games this year. He's no star, but he's going to provide some great depth as the Rangers buckle down and go for it this year, which is something we never could've seen them doing a couple of months ago.Copyright NBC Owned Television Stations</td>\n",

While Democrats are worried about low turn out from their key voting blocs, Republicans continue to make do with a heavy white majority. One Fox News host doesn't think that white men have gotten the respect they deserve and made sure to make his point known.youtube.comEver since Barack Obama was elected as the President of the United States in 2008, the issue of race has become one that ignites many debates. Some say that the political left uses the race card to their advantage, while others believe that conservatives on the right invoke policies that continue to work against African Americans and other minorities. Democrats traditionally secure a large majority of the minority vote, gaining over 90 percent of the black vote, and over 70 percent of the Hispanic vote in the 2012 election.Republicans often get labeled as the party that is out of touch, led by older white males who aren't adapt to a changing America. This topic was discussed on the November 2 edition of \"Fox and Friends\" on Fox News. Co-host of the show \"The Five,\" Dana Perino joined the panel and was asked about the stigma the Republicans have of being the party that is consisted of older white men. \"You will hear that, it's been beaten into our heads, that Republicans are too old, too white, too male. And that is true demographically if you look across the board,\" Perino said, before noting, 'there is no doubt that Republicans have a lot of work to do.\"\"I've been talking to a lot of campaigns, with a lot of younger people, it's impressive to see what the RNC has done to diversify their ranks,\" Perino made sure to mention. When it comes to the majority of the youth vote, Perino doesn't believe that Republicans will make huge gains, but will do enough to push them over the top during the midterms.\"They're not gonna necessarily win all the youth vote, but could they win enough to help some of our candidates, Republicans, win. I think they could. A lot of them, also, are young people who gave up their entire summers to help older white guys get reelected and they deserve a little credit.\"Co-host Tucker Carlson then responded to Perino's statement, by stating that in the United States, \"We need, I think, an older white guy appreciation day, I think they have done a lot for this country.\" Carlson gave an example, noting, \"I think that, penicillin, that's a contribution!\"In the 2012 election, President Obama was able to secure 60 percent of the youth vote, between the ages of 18 and 29, compared to only 36 percent who sided with Republican nominee, Mitt Romney. Republicans have continued to push for a political agenda that go against what the majority of young Americans typically stand by, including LGBT rights, abortion, immigration and education and student loan policies.</td>\n",

              "      <td>During the explorations, as humans worked their way in observing the uncharted parts of the moon, archived photos of the Apollo missions gave the idea that other living things might have been watching the explorers as well. Apparently, one particular photo suggested that aliens might really exist.The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) launched the first Apollo mission in 1969, which brought the first humans to land on the moon's untouched surface. Various manned missions took place until 1972. Looking back, Apollo 15 was the first of the Apollo \"J\" missions that was capable of staying on the moon for a longer period of time and has also shown greater surface mobility. The objective was basically to explore the Hadley-Appenine region of the moon and be able to set-up and perform lunar scientific experiments. The mission also aims to make engineering evaluations of new Apollo equipment, conduct lunar orbital experiments and take shots of the said region.Apparently, several alleged sightings of unidentified flying objects or UFO's were recorded around the world. But while researchers were browsing through the old images of the Apollo 15 mission, one of them noticed that an image of a UFO was captured on one of the photos, Tech Times reports. For some, the image could have been some debris that was captured by the camera while some claim that it could be a result of the photo's developing process. On the other hand, some say that the image might have been formed by a fragment of dust on the camera but some non-believers say that it was just developing error. UFO believers and enthusiasts believe that the image that was discovered was actually that of an alien which observes human explorers and the alleged image of a UFO might have been fascinated with the astronauts.In other news, it was reported that a commercial airline pilot from London's Heathrow Airport said that they had encountered and has almost hit a ball-shaped UFO. The pilot added that his aircraft almost had contact with the unidentified flying object, but as described by the pilot, the silvery metallic-like orb surprisingly maneuvered and flew a feet above the airplane. However, reports say that \"it wasn't possible to either trace the object or determine the cause of the sighting.\"Email Address: edgereyesjr@gmail.comTo contact the editor, e-mail:</td>\n",

              "      <td>By Amie Parnes and Justin Sink - 11/09/14 06:00 AM ESTAs President Obama congratulated Republican lawmakers for “running very strong campaigns” during a meeting Friday at the White House, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (Nev.) stared, stone-faced, into the distance.Reid was seated at the president’s elbow, but in many ways, the gulf between the two leaders has never seemed greater.Tension between Obama and Reid has been long simmering, multiple sources with knowledge of their relationship say. It exploded into the headlines following Tuesday’s landslide victory for Republicans.Within minutes of networks declaring that Republicans had seized back the Senate, the Washington Post published a report featuring David Krone, Reid’s chief of staff, blasting President Obama for the party’s losses.Krone described Obama as a drag on Democratic candidates across the country, with the president’s sagging approval ratings and the administration’s botched implementation of ObamaCare steepening the gradient that vulnerable incumbents had to climb. Moreover, Krone charged, the White House had kept Senate Democrats from tapping some of the president’s most loyal donors.The hit was the political equivalent of the kind of uppercut Reid might have delivered during his boxing career.Democratic sources said the Majority Leader was aware of Krone’s cooperation with the Post, and that his office disapproves of staffers who freelance to the press. One Democratic operative described the story as \"a way to protect Reid for the losses that we knew we were going to face.”“The way it was done was to ensure that people knew Reid had no fault.”Reinforcing the notion that the Post story was an ordered hit, Reid’s communications director, Adam Jentleson, retweeted multiple links to the story.The White House, for its part, publicly insisted there was nothing to see there.Press secretary Josh Earnest argued the comments did not represent the true relationship between Reid and Obama, noting the pair had worked effectively on a slew of the president’s priorities. And an administration official said the White House had been fielding calls from senators, Senate chiefs of staff, top operatives, and Democratic lobbyists insisting that they did not share Krone’s views.But Earnest betrayed the administration’s annoyance with the story when pressed as to whether there was a need for the president to mend fences with the majority leader.“Well, if there is, I'm confident that's something that the President and Senator Reid, given their strong track record, will be able to take care of,” Earnest said. “If they do that, I doubt it will be published in The Washington Post, frankly.”One Democrat familiar with the White House’s thinking said the perception at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue was that Krone was looking to shift blame squarely to Obama for Tuesday night’s devastating results.  Despite the public friction, the White House and Reid’s office have worked closely on preparing a lame duck agenda, including new funding requests to fight Ebola and to pursue the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Both Obama and Reid are also eager to advance dozens of the president’s appointees before Republicans seize control of the upper chamber.But those familiar with the Reid-Obama dynamic say that there has also been tension between the two since at least 2011, when the president had plans to negotiate a big debt limit deal. That never came to pass. \"I think how the president and his team — and I emphasize his team — mishandled the debt limit negotiations left a sour taste, and it's never really recovered since then,” said one source familiar with the negotiations.That friction has only been exacerbated by tension over access to the president’s donors. White House lawyers told the Senate Majority PAC not to contact donors for more than a week after the president headlined events for the fundraising group, expressing concerns that doing so would violate federal election laws. In the Post story, Krone accused Obama of creating that rule ad hoc.\"Money has been a long-standing frustration,\" a source said. \"Every two years, they've gone to the White House, asked for help and they haven't always gotten it.\"An individual familiar with the White House’s thinking said that view irked those within the administration who saw the restrictions as a genuine necessity.The White House has also defended the president’s role in the midterm campaign, noting that the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has publicly endorsed the president’s work on behalf of Democratic candidates.“I do think that a bit of the hyperbole over the president is overplayed,” DSCC director Guy Cecil said at a Playbook lunch after the election. “He’s done everything we’ve asked.”Those on both sides of the relationship downplay the notion of any personal animosity between Reid and Obama.\"Neither of them are social people so calling them 'friends' would be a ridiculous term,” said one operative. \"But they've always respected each other and the president has trusted Reid to carry out his agenda in the Senate. But that said, the executive and legislative branches will always have bumps here and there. But other than small frustrations, it's never been anything big.\"Moreover, there was even a grudging respect in some quarters for the manner in which Krone’s hit was delivered. \"A lot of people in this town will stab you in the back,” said one Democratic strategist. “But David is very much a stab-you-in-the-front kind of guy. He wanted to make sure the White House knew it was coming from him and I think a lot of people respect that.”While the Post story stung, there’s little indication it will permanently spoil Reid and Obama’s relationship. The White House believes there are too many policy priorities for the two not to continue working together closely. Reid loyalists agree, saying there’s little chance of the White House freezing him out.\"How are they going to take it out on him?\" the operative pondered aloud, regarding the White House. \"They still need Sen. Reid. I'm sure they're upset. No one wants to be called out. But retribution? I don't think they have either the muscle or the inclination to do that.\"</td>\n",

              "      <td>Women, you really can have both a family and a fulfilling career. You just have to do it just right. (Men, you get more freedom.) A new study from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis looks into how having a family affects women and men. As it turns out, it's complicated.The study (a hat-tip to Wonkblog's Ylan Q. Mui for highlighting it) focuses on academic economists and finds that moms are more productive than non-moms throughout their careers. But having a kid at the wrong time — or alone — or having too many kids — can make a mother far, far less productive.What they studiedResearchers looked at the research output of economists, measuring the impacts of their publications by using RePEc, an online database of economics papers. They created indexes to measure the impact of those economists' research, then matched that data up with the more than 10,000 responses they received to surveys asking detailed questions about the economists' academic careers, as well as family lives — when children were born, how many there are, and how it affected their work lives.What they foundFirst, the simplest finding: \"We find in our entire sample of about 10,000 male and female economists that men's productivity is not associated with their family situation in an economically significant manner.\" In fact, they find a small uptick in productivity for untenured men who become fathers — an uptick that may be attributable to the \"provider effect,\" says Krapf: these men may feel added pressure to produce once they have kids.The situation is more complicated for women. First off, moms are more productive than non-moms throughout their careers. The below charts show childless, one-child, and multiple-child women's productivity as measured by a publication index the authors created for this report.(Source: Krapf et al.)It's not all bad news: researchers found that a mom's first child is not significantly associated with a hit to the mother's productivity. But more kids change that outcome. The authors write that the results imply \"a mother of three children has, on average, a research record reflecting a loss of four years of research output by the time all of her children have reached their teens.\" A mother of two, likewise, has a 2.5-year loss of output.But even if a woman does only have one child, there are other factors that can drag on her productivity. Childrens' ages matter, too, for example. Moms of young children, for example, see their productivity drop off 15 to 17 percent, compared to childless women.And family planning plays a huge role. Having a kid before age 30 is associated with a drag on productivity by 13 percent, and unintended pregnancy (which they define as pregnancies in unpartnered moms who were uninformed about their childcare options) pulls productivity down 13 to 17 percent. Meanwhile, there's no effect for women having kids in their early 30s, and only a small (but statistically insignificant) effect for women in their late 30s.With all that taken into account, it appears there's a specific window in which to have the optimal family, so long as it's small: \"Women who become mothers in the 30- to 34-year age bracket fare substantially better; having an only child at that time of their careers does not appear to be detrimental to their research productivity,\" the authors write.So 29-to-33-year-old childless-and-married ladies should get cracking.What it meansThere are a few big questions this study raises: for example, despite the obvious productivity hits they suffer form having kids, moms seem to remain more productive throughout their academic careers. Why?One reason for this, says one of the paper's authors, could be the types of women likely to have kids: \"The most likely reason may be selection, i.e. women who are more productive in the first place may be more likely to become mothers,\" says Matthias Krapf, a professor at the University of Zurich.But it also implies what many women already know: that they have to think really, really hard about how to manage their working lives once they have kids — more so than men do.\"All of these results suggest that a first child need not destroy any academic career plans. Female academics who carefully project ahead and responsibly orchestrate their private lives appear to be well able to cope with motherhood — at least when they have only one child,\" the authors write.What it doesn't meanFirst off, it would be hard to generalize this study to all working women in the US. This is a study of academics — people for whom it's likely easier to have kids than, say, for minimum wage workers, thanks to all sorts of factors like higher pay, job security, access to child care, and paid family leave.Furthermore, it doesn't mean motherhood is exactly great for a woman's career. Several studies have found evidence of a motherhood penalty. In addition, despite the fact that it's illegal to discriminate against pregnant women, complaints about this type of discrimination are still commonplace, 36 years after it became illegal.In addition, the authors point out that there could be something misleading in the data showing all those super-productive late-career moms.\"[O]ur results are sensitive to survivor bias, i.e., women who become most unproductive and quit the profession after becoming mothers are not included in our sample,\" writes Krapf. In other words, if kids really kill a woman's productivity, she might drop out, leaving only the most uber-productive moms at the office.</td>\n",

And if he could repeatedly say, \"I can't breathe,\" it means he could breathe.Rank-and-file New York City police officers and their supporters have been making such arguments even before a grand jury decided against charges in Garner's death, saying the possibility that he contributed to his own demise has been drowned out in the furor over race and law enforcement.Officers say the outcry has left them feeling betrayed and demonized by everyone from the president and the mayor to throngs of protesters who scream at them on the street.\"Police officers feel like they are being thrown under the bus,\" said Patrick Lynch, president of the police union.The grand jury this week cleared a white patrolman, Daniel Pantaleo, who was caught on video applying what appeared to be an illegal chokehold on the black man. Mayor Bill de Blasio said the case underscores the NYPD's need to improve relations with minorities.But Lynch said: \"What we did not hear is this: You cannot go out and break the law. What we did not hear is that you cannot resist arrest. That's a crime.\"At the noisy demonstrations that have broken out over the past few days, protesters have confronted police who had nothing to do with the case. Signs read: \"NYPD: Blood on your hands,\" \"Racism kills\" and \"Hey officers, choke me or shoot me.\" Some demonstrators shouted, \"NYPD pigs!\" More than 280 people have been arrested, and more demonstrations were planned Friday.In private and on Internet chat rooms, officers say they feel demoralized, misunderstood and \"all alone.\"Some are advising each other that the best way to preserve their careers is to stop making arrests like that of Garner's, in defiance of the NYPD's campaign of cracking down on minor \"quality of life\" offenses as a way to discourage serious crime.\"Everyone is just demonizing the police,\" said Maki Haberfeld, a professor of police studies at John Jay College of criminal justice. \"But police follow orders and laws. Nobody talks about the responsibility of the politicians to explain to the community why quality-of-life enforcement is necessary.\"The fatal encounter occurred in July after Pantaleo and other police officers responded to complaints about Garner, a heavyset 43-year-old father of six.The video showed Garner telling officers to leave him alone and refusing to be handcuffed. Pantaleo, an eight-year veteran, appeared to wrap his arm around Garner's neck and take him down to the ground with the help of other officers.Garner could be heard saying, \"I can't breathe,\" several times before he went motionless.The medical examiner later found that a chokehold resulted in Garner's death, but also that asthma, obesity and cardiovascular disease were contributing factors.While many have decried the death of another black man at the hands of a white officer, no evidence has come to light to suggest that Pantaleo's actions were racially motivated. His supervising sergeant at the scene was black, and so were some of the officers involved in the confrontation.As the video sparked accusations of excessive force, the police unions mounted a counter-narrative: that Garner would still be alive if he had obeyed orders, that his poor health was the main cause of his death and that Pantaleo had used an authorized takedown move - more like a headlock than a chokehold - to subdue him.While the grand jury proceedings were secret, Pantaleo's lawyer has said that the officer testified that he never tried to choke Garner and did not believe the man was in mortal danger.Pantaleo's defenders have included Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who argued that the grand jury outcome would have been the same if Garner had been white, and that police were right to ignore his pleas that he couldn't breathe.\"The fact that he was able to say it meant he could breathe,\" said King, the son of a police officer.\"And if you've ever seen anyone locked up, anyone resisting arrest, they're always saying, `You're breaking my arm, you're killing me, you're breaking my neck.' So if the cops had eased up or let him go at that stage, the whole struggle would have started in again.\"Related Gallery: Reactions to the Eric Garner case</td>\n",

              "      <td>Baylor lost out on the final spot in the College Football Playoff to Ohio State.The two teams both had one loss and both won their conferences. Baylor's two best wins (TCU, Kansas State) were arguably better than OSU's (Michigan State, Wisconsin). Baylor's loss to 7-5 West Virgina on the road was also better than Ohio State's 14-point loss to 6-6 Virginia Tech at home.So what gives?In the end, it came down to strength of schedule. Both teams were 11-1, and Ohio State played better teams, so they made it in.The playoff committee taught Baylor a lesson that's going to resonate across the college football world — you can no longer get away with playing nobody in the non-conference.Baylor got penalized for playing the weakest non-conference schedule of any playoff contender. Outside of the Big 12, Baylor played SMU, Northwestern State, and Buffalo this year.Playing small schools like this is a relic from the old system. In order to get bowl eligible, teams used to schedule weak teams in the non-conference to inflate their win totals. That's why the first few weeks of the college football season largely consist of big teams destroying small teams by 30.Those days are over. By leaving Baylor out of the playoff, the committee has set a precedent that playing a legitimate non-conference schedule is a prerequisite for playoff consideration.\"I think this is going to be a wake-up call for our schools and others around the country,\" Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby told ESPN on Sunday afternoon. \"The committee has made it clear that non-conference strength of schedule is something they're going to evaluate.\"Perennial powers beating up on small teams is a thing of the past, and it's a major shift in the sport. Going forward, we're going to have a bunch of monster non-conference matchups over the first few weeks of the year. Smart programs saw this coming. Ever since the playoff was adopted, teams have been scrambling to beef up their future non-conference schedules. Just look at the current schedule for September 3, 2016:Alabama-USC LSU-Wisconsin UCLA-Texas A&amp;M Notre Dame-Texas Clemson-AuburnMore than ever before, we're seeing big schools schedule losable non-conference games against other elite programs.Baylor is one of the teams that has yet to beef up its schedule. They play SMU, Lamar, and Rice in the non-conference next year, and Northwestern State, SMU, and Rice in 2016. If they don't rethink that schedule, they could find themselves in the same situation again.More From Business InsiderThe 32 Best Prospects In The 2015 NFL Draft The 20 Highest-Paid Coaches In College Football Nick Saban's Reaction To Alabama Getting The No. 1 Seed Was Priceless</td>\n",

              "      <td>There are approximately 1.3 million apps available for our smartphones and tablets. Many are simply a bad idea. Most are average in use or scope. Fortunately, some very innovative developers have changed the way we used to do things for the better. Here are five mind-boggling apps that I know you're going to want.1. Preserve old photosYou probably have photo albums and shoeboxes full of old print photos. If you take care of them they should last for decades, but during a move, house fire or natural disaster they might get damaged or destroyed. Plus, if they're sitting in a box or on the shelf, no one else can enjoy them.That's why so many people spend hours scanning photos into a computer to preserve and share them. Unfortunately, scanning is a slow process.You have to take the photo out of the photobook, put it on a scanner and wait for a while. Once you've scanned it, there's still a lot of work you have to do. You need to crop it, straighten it, color correct and clean up any scanning artifacts.Now, there's an app that makes preserving print photos a snap, literally. It's called Heirloom (Free; iOS, Android). You simply take a picture of a photo and it does the cropping and color correcting automatically. You can even leave photos in their albums, so you don't risk damaging or losing them.Once the photo is ready, you can upload it to Facebook, Twitter or another site, or upload it to Heirloom's own social network. You can upload as many photos as you want. So, what are you waiting for?2. Get better customer serviceHow many hours of your life have you spent on hold waiting for customer service? It's probably more than a few. You could be doing much better things with your time.That's what makes the FastCustomer app (Free; iOS, Android) such a must-have. Once you call customer service, it waits on hold for you. When the customer service agent picks up, FastCustomer rings you so you can talk to them. How neat is that?3. Record your sleepPlenty of people talk in their sleep, but unless there's someone else listening, you never know what you said. Fire up Sleep Talk Recorder (Free; iOS, Android) before hitting the hay and it will start recording when you start talking, or snoring.The next day, you can listen to everything. It's also good for detecting potential health problems like sleep apnea.4. See more of the world around youIn sci-fi movies with robots, there's often a scene where you see the world from the robot's point of view. It usually shows that the robot has a fancy overlay showing extra information about everything it's seeing.You can do the same thing, and you don't even need fancy new technology like Google Glass or Oculus Rift. Just grab an augmented reality app like Tagwhat (Free; iOS, Android).Using the app, point your smartphone or tablet camera at a business to look up its information on the Web, Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare and other social sites. You can even see comments and reviews from other people.Point the app at landmarks to get more information, or just cruise around town and let the app tell you about deals and events near you, or even just cool stories.5. Measure distance without a rulerHave you ever needed to take a measurement, but didn't have a ruler or tape measure handy? Perhaps the object was too big or too far away to measure by hand? With this clever app, you can measure nearly anything from small items inside your home to objects like buildings and more.EasyMeasure(Free; iOS, Android) lets you point your smartphone or tablet's camera at any object and see the object's dimensions on the screen. Now it does take a little work from you, unless you have a phone or tablet with Intel's RealSense camera like the Dell Venue 8 7000. Still, once you get the hang of it, you'll find plenty of ways to use it.On the Kim Komando Show, the nation's largest weekend radio talk show, Kim takes calls and dispenses advice on today's digital lifestyle, from smartphones and tablets to online privacy and data hacks.

              "      <td>This morning I arose in a very cold house. It was 48 degrees in the warmest part of the living room. How cold is that? Well, I'll put it this way. I woke up to the sound of my dog drinking out of the toilet, strike that, cracking through a layer of ice to drink from the toilet! Now, that is something not everyone can claim they've experienced. And as awful as that may sound to some of you, know I could have avoided it. It was a choice. The farmhouse has two wood stoves, one in the back mudroom near the plumbing and one in the living room. Had I stoked both the fires and got up a little earlier it could have been a lot more comfortable than this, but since the temperature wasn't dropping below zero outside I chose to put my energy towards sleep instead of comfort.And sleep I did! I got a solid eight hours under wool and sheepskins, Gibson the border collie curled up under the covers by my chest. Together we are a kindled fire and were warm as could be inside our little nest. I woke up smiling in the dark and watched the steam rise off my skin and swirl in the air around my curvy body. I laughed in absolute joy at this, because I'm not sure what could be more proof positive that I am alive and well in this windy world? Fire always win the battle over ice, and I am a goddamned furnace.Now, I wanted to share what happened next because I think it may bring some of you out of a place of worry or despair and into one of joy and power. I started a fire. Hear me out.When I laid in bed I knew I had the farm chores out in the biting air, some hunting to do in the icy forest, and a list of deadlines, bills, worries, and obligations. I knew I was behind in the mortgage, over my head in many ways. I am not waking up to a world of financial or physical comforts by any stretch, and that is because of the choices I made in my life. I could either sit in bed with wide eyes and fret about these things, let worries about money consume me, let the easy heat of the undercover realm keep me prisoner, and give up. Just roll over and pray to win the lottery...Or I could get up and let my skin steam.I headed over the that wood stove, naked and crouching, like something out of a National Geographic about primal man's first invention of fire. I opened the stove and saw all I needed to see. The keystone that changed my view on the entire day: hot coals. I opened the tightly-sealed woodstove and the first flash of oxygen lifted those coals from embers into sparks and a red light lit up my face in the darkness. A red light I created through a lineage of choices, from installing the stove years ago, to harvesting firewood, to stoking the fire last night, to opening it this morning to let that light shine on me. Next to the stove was a hatchet, some light pine, and paper. I had all the tools I needed to start a real fire, right there next to me! Another series of choices I put in place. And what do fires offer? Comfort, heat, warm water, energy! I chopped up some wood and within moments I had kindling. I placed it in a all tee pee around a red coal. It smoked and then erupted in flames and soon I had a proper fire. I added larger dry wood around that little triangle and soon a small dance of atoms was a true roaring stove blaster. Guys, fire was there all along, I just needed to bring it into being with the right tools, preparation and knowledge.I got dressed, made coffee, let the dogs out, and started my day. The animals were fed, the farm is humming, and I already started a new logo project for a reader's farm and handed over a new comp sheet of logos to another college for their draft horse club. This was work I was trained to do and helps bring income to this farm. It's an act of creation, of skill, of light just like that fire. I avoided Facebook, Paypal, Reddit, Twitter... the whole damn Internet. I didn't want someone else's picture of their 10-point buck or engagement ring or new kitchen counters or Instagrams starting my day with any sense of lacking. Not because other people's joy makes me sad, but it's hard for anyone to see such things and not feel she is already starting the day needing to be something besides the naked, laughing, perfect rubenesque farm goddess she already is.Nothing puts out an inner fire like self doubt. So I just did my work in this morning storm of creativity. See, when I was naked and cold in the dark all I saw was a hint of possibility: a red coal. But I knew with every piece of my being that dry wood, a little effort, and a hatchet would be the perfect combination of intention and violence to bring out flames. As I did the work no part of me doubted that the fire would come. It's just want happens next. It's proven fact, that this mixture of circumstances makes a fire. So no part of me doubted that within ten minutes I would be sipping hot coffee in a wool sweater. And no part of me doubted that fire would bring heat, and inspiration, and that washing wave of blessing for living this life on my own terms. It's a Wednesday morning and I am about to spend a day writing on my own farm! That was a fairytale through most of my twenties until I realized I was a furnace.You are a furnace, too.Here's what I want to share today: Don't focus on what you lack. Don't start your day with other people's accomplishments. Start your day knowing you are capable of making the life you desire. You need to see your own story as a pile of embers that just needs the work of kindling to explode into something wonderful. I live my life that way everyday. And when I am scared or anxious or worried about silly things -- I remember the certainty in which fire comes from hope and force. And as long as I am able to hold the coals of that metaphor close to my heart and ignite my own life's goals I can achieve anything. It requires being focused on the good of yourself, the good of others, and the bounty of this kind world. And it also means moving yourself out of a sense of victimhood and lacking and into one of power, a gift you can only give yourself. But once you start playing with fire, it's hard not to feel like anything is possible. The proof is here at this small farm and hundreds of others out there among you fine folks.You never have to worry about me. This farm will always be okay and only grow to be stronger, healthier, wiser and better equipped to help others find the same happiness if they want it. And I think the best thing I can do to make my fire burn a little brighter is remind you that you also have a hot coal in there somewhere. So choose to be happy, and it is a choice. Smile when you are cold, naked, and scared. Light the Need Fire of your own story, and share that heat with the rest of us. We sure as hell need it when the toilet bowl freezes...</td>\n",

If you Google \"best sunscreen,\" the first link that appears is an Environmental Working Group list of products that meet its safety criteria. Look further and you'll see natural-health gurus proclaiming that many sunscreens are full of toxic ingredients like oxybenzone and retinyl palmitate, which could mess with your hormones or actually increase the risk of skin cancer. They advise sticking to mineral options with titanium dioxide or zinc oxide as the active ingredient. Yet others say even those formulas have the potential to be bad for you. What do you do now?Photo: Antonio Guillem/Getty ImagesFirst, know that sunscreen is necessary to protect your skin from the harmful effects of ultraviolet light, according to Mona Gohara, M.D., associate clinical professor of dermatology at the Yale School of Medicine. \"We know that 90 percent of skin cancers and 90 percent of the signs of aging come from ultraviolet light. That, we know for a fact. And the antidote to that is sunscreen,\" she says.The issue is that very few people are using sunscreen regularly (only 30 percent of women and 14 percent of men, per a recent study in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology), and those who do only use about half the recommended amount, according to separate research. And, sadly, people are still using tanning beds. To wit, rates of melanoma — the deadliest form of skin cancer — have doubled in the past 30 years, according to a recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Skin cancer and premature aging are both preventable, but still, adults skip sunscreen. \"People don't use it partially because they don't see the need for it,\" Dr. Gohara told the Cut. \"And some people just don't think it's good for them.\"Here, several myths about sunscreen and what's safest to use on your skin.MYTH: Oxybenzone should be avoided at all costs. There's conflicting information online about the safety of chemical blocks like oxybenzone, which absorb UV rays (as opposed to mineral blocks that reflect light). Fears that oxybenzone can penetrate the skin and act like estrogen in the body stem from a widely publicized 2001 study in which rats fed oxybenzone had enlarged uteruses after four days.Dr. Gohara says the dermatologic community takes issue with that piece of research since the rats were given \"megadoses\" of the chemical (1,500 milligrams per kilogram of body weight) and, as she explains, \"consuming something is quite different than putting it on your skin.\" A 2011 analysis published in JAMA Dermatology found it would take 200 years of daily sunscreen application to reach the level of oxybenzone exposure observed in the rat study.In response, scientists have tested topical application of sunscreen on actual people. A 2004 study had 32 participants apply a basic lotion every day for a week. The following week, they applied lotion containing 10 percent oxybenzone (even higher than the 6 percent permitted by the FDA) and the researchers found no difference in hormone levels that could be attributed to sunscreen. Yes, the participants had detectable levels of oxybenzone in their urine, but that's because your body excretes it that way.\"There's no evidence that these [ingredients] are carcinogenic,\" Dr. Gohara says. \"That being said, if somebody's not comfortable, they're simply not comfortable and that's fine. There are plenty of alternatives that don't have oxybenzone.\"MYTH: Retinyl palmitate increases skin-cancer risk. Animal research suggested that common inactive-ingredient retinyl palmitate (a form of vitamin A) could actually accelerate skin damage. But the study (which was conducted by the National Toxicology Program and never published in a peer-reviewed journal) was done on albino mice, which are more susceptible to skin cancer than humans. An analysis published in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology found there is no evidence that using retinyl palmitate in sunscreen raises cancer risk in humans.MYTH: Sunscreen is for the beach. Dr. Gohara says the average person gets the wrong idea from the name of the product alone. \"It shouldn't be called 'sunscreen,' it should be 'ultraviolet screen,'\" she says. \"'Sunscreen' connotes that you should only be wearing it when you're in the sun.\" UV light is present even on cloudy or rainy days, she says. \"What we see in skin-cancer patients and people who are aging prematurely is that either they don't protect themselves or they only protect themselves in the sun,\" she told the Cut. \"Ultraviolet light is around all the time, whether you're driving, or whatever.\"MYTH: SPF 100 blocks 100 percent of UV rays. That isn't how it works. In fact, no sunscreen blocks all UV rays, and SPF ratings refer only to protection against UVB, not UVA, rays (more on that below). The difference in protection is smaller than the ratings suggest: SPF 15 blocks 93 percent of UVB rays, SPF 30 filters 97 percent, SPF 50 blocks 98 percent, and SPF 100 blocks 99 percent. But only for up to two hours. You need to reapply that often — or sooner after swimming or sweating excessively — because the product wears off.The American Academy of Dermatology recommends using broad-spectrum SPF 30 or higher, though the Environmental Working Group argues that SPF values greater than 50 could lead to a false sense of security. The FDA is aware of this issue: The agency proposed a regulation stating that products over 50 be labeled 50+, but it's still under review.One sunscreen regulation that's already in effect is that \"broad-spectrum\" label: Only products that pass the FDA's test proving they block both UVA (aging) and UVB (burning) rays can make such a claim, which is good to know because exposure to both kinds can increase skin-cancer risk.MYTH: People of color don't need it. Kerry Washington has been trying to spread the word about this belief as part of her role as a Neutrogena spokesperson. \"There have been a lot of misconceptions, particularly in communities of color, that because you have melanin in your skin, you don't need to protect it,\" she said in a recent interview with the Huffington Post.Darker skin (or even tanned skin) might have more melanin in it than fair skin, but the protective effect is minimal: Experts say black skin likely has a max SPF of 4. And while skin cancer is less common in people of color, the average five-year survival rate for melanoma is lower among African-Americans (75 percent) than it is for Caucasians (93 percent). It might be because doctors aren't catching it in time: One study found that late-stage melanoma diagnoses were more common in people of color than in white patients.MYTH: Sprays are worthless. They do work, you just need to hold the bottle a few inches from your skin, and rub it in so you don't miss any spots. The exception is your face: The AAD recommends spraying the product into your hands and then applying it in order to avoid inhaling any fumes or particles. The FDA is investigating the safety of spray products but hasn't made any rulings.So what should you do?Use sunscreen and lots of it. The best thing to do is apply your broad-spectrum formula of choice before getting dressed, and 30 minutes before going outside. Stand in front of a full-length mirror and put that stuff everywhere, including your ears, hairline, the back of your neck, tops of your feet, and backs of your knees. Experts say that using less than the recommended one ounce (or two tablespoons) over your entire body drastically reduces your protection, though you might think you're safe to stay outside. Reapply using the same amount every two hours.And think beyond sprays and lotions: \"It's not just about the sunscreen, it's about sunglasses, sun-protective clothing, and avoiding the sun during peak hours. Sun protection and skin-cancer prevention really is a lifestyle,\" she says. \"It's like if you have heart disease, you don't just lay off the doughnuts — you have to exercise, you have to do a lot of stuff.\" Click through for great sunscreens to choose from this summer:</td>\n",

              "      <td>Subway was reeling from declining sales before its spokeman Jared Fogle was charged with child pornography, reports Kaja Whitehouse Robert Deutsch, USA TODAYThe troubles surrounding Subway's longtime spokesman Jared Fogle couldn't have come at a worse time for the sandwich maker.After a meteoric rise to become one of the nation's largest fast-food chains, Subway has been suffering from falling sales and declining customer satisfaction amid increased competition. Last year, for the first time ever, it lost its long-held spot as the nation's second-largest restaurant chain by sales to Starbucks, according to research firm Technomic. And now the brand's most public face has been tarnished by criminal charges.Fogle appeared in court Wednesday on charges of traveling for sex with minors, and for receiving and distributing child pornography.\"Jared Fogle is agreeing to plead guilty to the charges filed against him today,\" said Fogle's attorney Jeremy Margolis in a statement.Fogle, famous for losing about 245 pounds on a diet of Subway sandwiches in college, also crossed state lines to pay for sex with minors, prosecutors said.\"We no longer have a relationship with Jared and have no further comment,\" Subway wrote in a tweet Tuesday.The scandal comes ahead of Subway's 50th anniversary next week and as the chain seeks to beat back rising competition from fast-food sandwich makers, like Chick-fil-A, as well as fast-casual restaurants like Chipotle. The competition resulted in a 3.3% sales decline at Subway last year, to $11.9 billion from $12.3 billion in 2013 — marking the largest loss across the restaurant chain industry, as tracked by Technomic.The sales drop pushed Subway from the nation's No. 2 largest restaurant as measured by sales to the No. 3 slot, according to Technomic's 2015 Top 500 Chain report out in March. Starbucks stole the No. 2 slot. McDonald's remains No. 1.Whether Jared's tarnished reputation will affect sales this year remains to be seen, but experts say it can't help.\"They've already been struggling, and with what we have seen with the negative publicity around Jared, I think that isn't going to help,\" says Darren Tristano, executive vice president with Technomic. \"It very likely is going to have some negative impact.\"Subway's ascent to the top was boosted by its early image as a healthy fast-food option, spurred in good part by the slimmed-down Fogle, who began starring in ads for the company about 15 years ago. The sandwich shop became the nation's fourth-largest restaurant chain by sales in 2007 and then jumped past Wendy's and Burger King in 2008 to take the No. 2 slot, according to Technomic data.But along with other large fast-food chains, Subway has been losing traction with customers who are increasingly enamored with newer chains that boast fresh, natural or local ingredients. According to the American Customer Satisfaction Index, as of June Subway's customer satisfaction rating has fallen 6.1% since 2012, the first year ACSI started tracking the chain.Subway may have been offering customers the \"build-your-own\" meal model and an assortment of vegetables long before chains like Chipotle and Chop't, but established chains have lost some allure, said ACSI's June 2015 Restaurant Report.\"As the economy improves, consumers with more disposable income — but squeezed for time — want higher-quality ingredients, freshness and better service at a reasonable price. They also are willing to pay a bit more,\" the report said.Plus, consumers' hankering for a sub sandwich has started to fade. Traffic to submarine sandwich shops — including chains like Subway and Quiznos — was down 4% in the 12 months ended in June, with 95 million fewer visits than the year before, according to market research company NPD Group.While Subway has traditionally been viewed as a healthier option in terms of having fewer calories than many mainstream fast-food options, consumers don't put as much stock in calorie counts anymore compared to other health attributes, said Molly Harnischfeger, a director in the restaurant and food services practice at consulting firm AlixPartners.She said consumers are more focused on \"local ingredients, food with integrity, having fresh produce. Those are the types of things that consumers are demanding of companies now. It's not just about calories.\"Also, what consumers consider good value is no longer just about low prices. Most consumers define value as quality of ingredients for the price, according to a report from AlixPartners. Bundled offerings, large portion sizes and lowest prices have become less important over the last year, the report said.Technomic's Tristano attributes Subway's woes in part to the rising cost of its famous $5 Footlong, a 12-inch sandwich that ran into trouble in 2013 for being under the 12 inches advertised by its name.The higher price of the footlong forced people seeking cheap, healthy meals to look elsewhere, Tristano says.Contributing: The Indianapolis StarRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1LlrDxj</td>\n",

And if history is any indication, it could spell short-term pain.The S&amp;P 500 has closed above its five-day moving average for 20 consecutive days. That has only happened just three times before in the last two decades.Now, here’s the sad part: Four weeks after each of one those streaks came to an end, the S&amp;P 500 was down, for an average loss of 3 percent. That’s according to a recent study by Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at MKM Partners.What’s more, the S&amp;P 500 has had just seven prior streaks above its five-day moving average lasting 18 days or more. And those, too, also averaged losses four and six weeks after ending.(Watch: Wal-Mart helps lift Dow industrials to record finish)Does that mean there will be bad news for stocks soon?“The last time we saw a decline like we saw in October, which was about 9 percent, was back in September to November 2012,” Krinsky said. “To recover 12 percent off the lows took 49 trading days. We just rallied 12 percent off the lows in 19 trading days. So the ascent of the rally has been rather remarkable.”(Read: Asian markets seen higher on Wall Street lead; oil in focus)And because the five-day moving average is such a short-term indicator, the fact that the S&amp;P 500 has remained above it for four weeks makes the rally so remarkable and unusual, he said.But with Thursday’s close at 2,039.33, the S&amp;P 500 is extremely close to hitting an important level, according to Krinsky. “We’re pushing against a pretty good area of resistance around 2,040,” he said.If that resistance holds, heforesees the index returning towardan area between 1,970 and 1,980, roughly 3 percent lower from current prices.That’s not enough to worry Krinsky, however. “Nothing too concerning,” he said. “But risk/reward from this level seems to favor the downside.”</td>\n",

              "      <td>Blake and MirandaBlake Shelton and Miranda Lambert are in the news again this week with rumors of an imminent split. On Nov. 13, The National Enquirer reported that the country stars are on the outs again, this time following Blake's recent interview on 60 Minutes. During the interview, Blake was extremely candid, and even admitted to falling in love with Miranda while he was married to his first wife (which actually isn't new information).\"Miranda is fuming and embarrassed over Blake’s airing of their dirty laundry, and she blasted him for confessing he cheated on his then-wife with her,\" said a source. \"Blake finally confirmed what everyone has always suspected!\"Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert's marriage is apparently doomed according to their recent body language too. The two have walked red carpets together, and posed for photos wearing big smiles, but sources say that it's all an act.\"While both sport million-dollar smiles, their body language is a far more accurate barometer of their inner feelings. While it is subtle, it is noticeable in the photos that they are not leaning in toward each other, as they usually do. This is a common indicator of couples facing relationship challenges,\" said Wendy Patrick, co-author of Reading People.Divorce rumors peeked earlier this month when Miranda accepted two awards at the CMA's, but neglected to thank Blake. He, however, thanked her while accepting his award. Then there was the whole \"once a cheater, always a cheater\" thing, and people just don't trust Blake.If Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert don't split before the holidays, that won't really be surprising. The two have denied all the crazy break-up rumors in the past, and may not even be having any real problems... but who knows? The Epoch Times reports that things are so bad, the two are doing whatever they can to salvage what they have left. Oh, and there's that whole baby thing. Apparently Miranda wants a baby... but Blake doesn't. What do you make of the rumors?</td>\n",

              "      <td>(DVIDSHUB/Flickr) Stocks climbed well off the lows of the day after minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting leaked. The Dow lost more than 200 points in early trade, rallied after the minutes, and retreated again in the late afternoon. Crude oil sank to a fresh six-year low, while gold climbed to a four-week high. First, the scoreboard:Dow: 17,348.73, -162.61, (-0.93%) S&amp;P 500: 2,079.61, -17.31, (-0.83%) Nasdaq: 5,019.05, -40.30, (-0.80%)And now, the top stories on Wednesday:We got the minutes of the Federal Reserve's July meeting earlier than we should have. Bloomberg published a headline around 1:36 p.m. ET on the terminal that said \"most Fed officials in July saw conditions for [a] rate rise nearing.\" In a statement, the company said it \"inadvertently sent a headline ahead of the embargo\", which was to be lifted at 2:00 p.m. This is the second Fed-related leak within a month. In late July, the Fed disclosed that its staff economic projections had been accidentally published on its website. The minutes showed that one FOMC member was willing to raise rates last month, but others felt the economic pre-conditions had not been met. Most members thought the labor market was very close to maximum employment. They lowered their outlook for inflation following the downturn in energy prices. And, China came up: \"Several participants noted that a material slowdown in Chinese economic activity could pose risks to the U.S. economic outlook.\" Inflation was tepid in July. The consumer price index came in at 0.1% month-over-month (0.2% estimated), and 0.1% on a 'core' basis excluding volatile food and energy costs (0.2% expected). A 5.6% plunge in airline tickets – the biggest in nearly 20 years - weighed down the index. The energy index climbed 0.1%, as higher gas prices offset declines in other energy components. And, shelter inflation, or housing prices, continued to soar as they have, in contrast to the overall trend. Crude oil fell to a new six-year low. West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures in New York plunged more than 4% to as low as $40.97 in New York. Data from the Energy Information Administration showed that oil inventories unexpectedly climbed by 2.6 million barrels last week. Inventories are still at a level not seen at this time of year for the past 80 years. Chinese stocks had a wild day, rebounding to the green after the benchmark Shanghai Composite fell more than 5% in early trade. There had been speculation that the People's Bank of China may cut the reserve-ratio requirements for banks by 50 basis points this weekend. DON'T MISS: TRADER: Prepare for 'the most bullish event for equities in 2015' »NOW WATCH: There is a secret US government airline that flies out of commercial airportsMore From Business InsiderSTOCKS CLIMB: Here's what you need to know STOCKS RISE: Here's what you need to know OIL SINKS TO 6-YEAR LOW: Here's what you need to knowRelated Video:</td>\n",

              "      <td>While Iran and North Korea’s nuclear programs are all the rage these days, the most dangerous nuclear threat facing the world continues to go largely unnoticed.Namely, China and India are both on the cusp of deploying multiple independently targetable reentry (MIRV) vehicles on their ballistic missiles, a development that is likely to have profound, far-reaching consequences for the region and beyond.MIRVed missiles carry payloads of several nuclear warheads each capable of being directed at a different set of targets. They are considered extremely destabilizing to the strategic balance primarily because they place a premium on striking first and create a “use em or lose em” nuclear mentality.Along with being less vulnerable to anti-ballistic missile systems, this is true for two primary reasons. First, and most obviously, a single MIRVed missile can be used to eliminate numerous enemy nuclear sites simultaneously. Thus, theoretically at least, only a small portion of an adversary’s missile force would be necessary to completely eliminate one’s strategic deterrent. Secondly, MIRVed missiles enable countries to use cross-targeting techniques of employing two or more missiles against a single target, which increases the kill probability.In other words, MIRVs are extremely destabilizing because they make adversary’s nuclear arsenals vulnerable to being wiped out in a surprise first strike. To compensate for this fact, states must come up with innovative ways to secure their deterrent from an enemy first strike. This usually entails increasing the size of one’s arsenal, and further dispersing to make it more difficult for an enemy to conduct a successful first strike. For example, when the U.S. first deployed MIRVed missiles in 1968, the Soviet Union had less than 10,000 nuclear warheads. A decade later, however, it had over 25,000 (of course, the Soviet Union deploying its own MIRVed missiles incentivized expanding the size of its arsenal since more warheads were needed per missile).With regards to China and India, then, the introduction of MIRVed missiles could have profound consequences of both of their nuclear postures. One of the most remarkable aspects of every nuclear state not named Russia or the United States is they have relied on an extremely small nuclear arsenal to meet their deterrent needs. This is especially true of India and China who have generally maintained minimum deterrence and no-first use doctrines. With the introduction of countervailing MIRVed missiles, however, there will be strong incentives on both sides to vastly increase the size of their arsenals if any to guard against the threat of a first strike by the other side.Of course, the consequences of China and India acquiring MIRVed missiles would not be limited to those states alone. Most obviously, India’s acquisition of MIRVed missiles would immediately threaten the survivability of Pakistan’s nuclear forces. In the short-term, this will probably result in Islamabad further dispersing its nuclear arsenal, which in general will leave it more vulnerable to Islamist terrorist groups in the country. Over the long-term, Pakistan will feel pressure to expand the size of its arsenal as well as acquire MIRVed capabilities of its own.The same pressures will be felt in Moscow. Since the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Russia has relied on its vast nuclear arsenal to compensate for its relative conventional weakness. In the eyes of Russian leaders, this will only grow more necessary as China continues to modernize its conventional military forces. Currently, Russia holds vastly more nuclear warheads than China, which is a source of relief for Moscow. As China MIRVs its missiles, however, as well as likely builds up the size of its arsenal, Moscow will see its nuclear superiority over Beijing rapidly erode. It can be counted on to respond by abrogating its arms control treaties with the United States, and expanding its own arsenal as well. In such a situation, a U.S. president would come under enormous domestic pressure to meet Russia’s buildup warhead for warhead.Thus, while the prospect of North Korea and Iran acquiring operationalized nuclear arsenals may be concerning, China and India’s MIRVed missiles present far greater threats to the world.Zachary Keck is the managing editor of The National Interest.

They present with all kinds of issues—from infidelity, to in-law troubles, and everything in between.Yet, despite the variety of marriage problems that can arise, there are some complaints that are so prevalent and common that they warrant being singled out.Related: Feeling Hopeless? Here’s How To Save Your MarriageBelow are eight of the most common complaints that unhappy husbands make about their wives. Read them. Believe them. Stop them:1. You’re a grump.When you speak to your husband, your voice tone is full of negativity, contempt and criticism. If he tries to express a concern or complaint about the marriage, you rise up in angry defensiveness and throw the blame back on him instead of hearing him out.2. You’re a nag.If your husband has a free moment, you pounce on him and order him to fix something around the house. If he goes out with friends, you text him incessantly, asking when he’ll be home. Basically, you’re a matrimonial version of the micro-managing boss.3. You’re a cold fish in bed.If he flashes you a flirtatious wink, you roll your eyes. If he reaches for you in bed, you turn your back to him. On those rare occasions you do give in and have sex, you lie there and stare at the ceiling, waiting for it to be over and sapping all the fun out of it.4. You’re a frump.Whether you’ve stopped exercising or started wearing sweatpants, you’ve let yourself go and lost your energy and enthusiasm for life. To be honest, this isn’t a top complaint that I hear from men; however, a woman who feels unattractive often withdraws—emotionally and physically—from her marriage. And that is something that husbands do complain about.Related: 50 of the Best Marriage Tips EVER5. You’re a “Mommy,” and nothing else.You get way more excited about a “Mommy &amp; Me” playdate than a romantic evening with your husband. Just keep in mind that a child-centered marriage isn’t a marriage at all; it’s just a daycare.6. You’re an alpha parent.As the leader of the parenting pack, you snap at your husband every time he tries to be a dad or parent his children in the way he sees fit. As a result, you rob your children of a father’s care and discipline, and you drive a wedge between you and your husband.7. You’re thankless.Whether your husband has put in major overtime at work or spent his entire long-weekend building you that backyard deck you want, you take his efforts for granted and fail to show appreciation for anything he does for you or your family.8. You’re (yawn) boring.You don’t have any interests or hobbies outside the marriage or home (no, Facebook isn’t a hobby). That makes you predictable and bland company who never has anything interesting to add to a conversation. You should get a life, to put it plainly.If you’re worried that the passion in your marriage is starting to subside, don’t panic. Instead, take a good, hard look at your own behavior. How can you bring more positivity and romance into your marriage? How can you make your husband feel more appreciated and desired? How can you build him up as a loving, competent parent? How can you make him happy?</td>\n",

              "      <td>Ellen DeGeneres shocked her talk show audience when she seemingly caught Leah Remini’s husband cheating on her on air.Ellen discovered the “affair” when she decided to give Leah’s husband, Angelo Pagan, a ring during the show. DeGeneres explained to the audience that she and Remini were going to prank call Pagan to get revenge for a prank he had recently played on his wife. According to Leah, Angelo was on a business trip and staying in a hotel (bet you can see where this going).Leah proved to be a terrible prank caller — her brilliant plan was for Ellen to ask Angelo random questions about his hotel in a silly voice. However, things got interesting when Angelo didn’t pick up the phone. Instead the audience heard a woman’s voice, and Remini grabbed the phone from DeGeneres while shouting an expletive.“What the f***! Who is this?” she asked.“This is Tiffany. Who’s this?” the woman responded.Leah informed Tiffany that she was Angelo’s wife, and Tiffany could be heard questioning Angelo in the background.“You’re married?” she asked.You can check out the exchange below. As you can see, the prank call actually ends up being a prank on The Ellen DeGeneres Show viewers — the audience’s awkward silence is soon broken by the sound of bells, and DeGeneres and Remini start to giggle.According to the Mirror, some Ellen Show viewers didn’t get the joke. Leah Remini later took to Twitter to inform her worried fans that Angelo Pagan isn’t cheating on her. She explained that the “affair” discovery was just a set-up to surprise her lucky audience with gifts worth hundreds of dollars.Regarding the Ellen show today; it was just a joke to throw the audience off to surprise them with the gifts! Me and @apangelo are good! — Leah Remini (@LeahRemini) December 17, 2014At least Leah Remini was in on the cheating stunt. As Nicki Minaj recently found out, sometimes Ellen prefers to amuse her audience by pranking her unsuspecting guests.Ellen DeGeneres might as well change her name to Ellen Be-Generous during the holidays — she’s one of the most giving talk show hosts when it comes to the free stuff that her audience members get. Each year she celebrates “12 Days of Giveaways” by giving her studio audience fantastic freebies like gift cards and electronics.Ellen DeGeneres is such a giver that she even brought her generosity to the Conan audience. According to the Hollywood Reporter, DeGeneres made a surprise appearance on Conan O’Brien’s late night show, and she chastised O’Brien for not giving away enough free stuff to his audience. You can see how she makes up for Conan’s Grinch-iness in the video below.Ellen DeGeneres might not be the best prankster, but she sure is good at playing Santa Claus (who wouldn’t want a pair of Jon Hamm’s used basketball shorts?).</td>\n",

              "      <td>A man from Kosovo believes he is the reincarnation of Adolf Hitler, the Nazi dictator to whom he bears a striking, eerie resemblance.Emin Djinovci, a 49-year-old Kosovan from Mitrovica, sports a jet black mustache and slicks his hair to one side, according the the Daily Mail. Traveling everywhere with a copy of Mein Kampf, Hitler’s manifesto, Djinovci earns his living as a Hitler look-alike, charging tourists roughly $90 for a photograph.Billing himself as Kosovo’s reincarnation of Adolf Hitler, Djinovci originates from Germany, which he left in 1998 in order to fight for secession from Serbia. He asserts that in this cause, he finds common ground with the real Adolf Hitler.“I am proud of my likeness to the Fuhrer because, like him, I fought against the Serbs – my enemies,” he said in an interview with InSerbia News. “It is easy. I find myself in Hitler’s character because he fought against my enemy. Enemy of my enemy is my friend. Yes, Serbs are my enemies.”Djinovci has five daughters, whom he calls “Hitler’s children.” As Metro notes, he would face arrest in Germany for the same actions, as glorifying Hitler or the Nazi regime is considered a serious crime, and prohibited by law. Local business leaders in Kosovo, however, reportedly have little problem with Djinovci’s method of earning a living, pointing out that it shows “great enterprise.”Earlier this month, a reminder of Hitler’s brutal regime was discovered in Brazil, as police noted a swastika emblazoned upon the bottom of a swimming pool. Flying overhead as part of an unrelated investigation, the officers were stunned to notice the Nazi symbol, which as the Inquisitr reported, had been in place for 13 years. As the swastika and pool reside on private property, officials were unable to file charges against the owner.Hitler ordered German forces to invade Yugoslavia and Greece in April of 1941. During that time, the majority of the Yugoslavian population consisted of Serbs and Croats. During the course of the Second World War, Serbs were widely persecuted by the occupying Axis forces.Though he is remembered as the leader of Germany’s Nazi party, Adolf Hitler was actually born in Austria.[Image: YouTube/ new scene 2014 via the Daily Mail]</td>\n",

              "      <td>Whether you try to hide it or not, you fart. Everybody does.But even though it's such a routine activity — the average person farts between 10 and 20 times per day — there's a lot about farting that you might not know.As part of research into the microbiome — the rich community of bacteria that live throughout your body — scientists have learned all sorts of interesting things about the bacteria that produce gas inside your intestines. Here are 9 crucial things to know about flatulence.1) You produce about 500 to 1500 milliliters of gas per day, and expel it in 10 to 20 fartsThis might be more than you'd expect, but it's been measured in controlled studies. The surprisingly hefty amount is the result of bacteria that live in your colon and feed on most of the food you eat, says Purna Kashyap — a gastroenterologist at the Mayo Clinic who studies the gut microbiome.\"There are a lot of carbohydrates that we consume — mainly present in vegetables, grains, and fruits — that our bodies don't have the enzymes necessary to digest,\" he says. \"These end up in large intestine, where microbes chew them apart and use them for energy, through the process of fermentation. As a byproduct, they produce gas.\"A huge variety of foods contain these complex carbs that we can't fully digest: virtually all beans, most vegetables, and anything with whole grains. For most people, this leads to somewhere between 500 to 1500 milliliters of gas daily — the equivalent of half a two-liter bottle of soda, every single day.2) 99 percent of the gas you produce does not smellOne of the reasons that we produce so much more gas than we realize is that nearly all of it is odorless.Hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane make up as much as 99 percent of the gas produced in our large intestines by volume. (They're supplemented by air you swallow — more on that below.) All of these gases are odorless, which is why much of the time, farts don't actually smell at all.The potent stink, research has found, is largely due to the 1 percent or so of compounds with sulfur in them, such as hydrogen sulfide. (This sort of research itself is pretty amazing: one experiment involved two people judging the smelliness of farts of 16 participants who'd been fed pinto beans, collected with the aid of \"gas-tight Mylar pantaloons.\")Caution: these contain sulfur. (Shutterstock.com)Bacteria need to consume sulfur to produce sulfurous gases, and though not all foods with complex carbs contain sulfur, many do. They're mainly foods that you probably already associate with farting — things like beans, onions, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, and dairy.3) Gum and soda can make you fart more(Shutterstock.com)Apart from the gases produced by bacteria, a significant proportion of your flatulence is simply made up of inadvertently swallowed air. It doesn't smell — it's mostly nitrogen and oxygen — but it sounds and feels the same coming out.Some of this swallowing goes on while you're asleep, but it can be increased by drinking carbonated beverages (after all, you're ingesting the carbonation) and by chewing gum.4) Farting is the result of a healthy, complex ecosystem in your intestinesBacteroides fragilis, one of the bacteria species involved in gas production, cultured in a petri dish. (Nathan Reading)Modern society views flatulence as a negative. This is unfortunate, because in most cases, it's the byproduct of a beautiful thing — the intricate ecosystem of bacteria living in your intestines.\"It's a complex ecology, with various organisms coexisting and thriving,\" Kashyap says. \"When a complex carbohydrate reaches your colon, some bacteria will break it down first, and then some of their byproducts will feed other bacteria. The whole community benefits from a single carbohydrate that you consume.\"What's more, you also benefit. Scientists are still unraveling the role of the microbiome in digestion, but it's known that the same bacteria that produce gas also generate vitamins and fatty acids that help maintain our colon lining, and may support our immune systems.5) There's a simple reason why you don't mind the smell of your own fartsAs this AsapScience video explains, experiments have confirmed that we find the smell of our own farts less offensive than others'.The reason: we become habituated to all smells over time. That's why you might notice a scent walking into a stranger's house, but seldom do for your own.It's also why you become habituated to the characteristic mix of odors produced by the bacteria inside your own body, which differs slightly from everyone else's. As a result, your own farts just don't have the same impact on you — even though they're just as pungent for everyone else.6) Yes, you can light a fart on fireBecause flatulence is partly composed of flammable gases like methane and hydrogen, it can be briefly set on fire.We don't recommend it, because of the risk of injury, but if you have to see it, there are plenty of examples here.7) No, you can't hold a fart in until it disappears(Shutterstock.com)This might seem obvious, but for whatever reason, people wonder about this question. At times, after holding in a fart for a while for social reasons, it can seem to disappear.However, this isn't actually possible. It might seem to vanish because you stop being conscious of it, and it leaks out gradually, but the physics of flatulence are pretty straightforward. A fart is a bubble of gas, and there's ultimately nowhere for it to go besides out of your anus.8) Beano cuts down on gas production by starving these bacteriaIn case you're wondering, the over-the-counter product Beano — which claims to \"prevent gas before it occurs\" — actually works as advertised. Two different controlled trials have found that it significantly reduces gas production in the hours following a bean-filled meal.The way it works is pretty simple: the pills contain an enzyme called alpha-galactosidase that cuts complex carbohydrates into shorter, simpler carbs that are much easier to digest. As a result, they get broken down in your small intestine, rather than making it all the way to the large intestine, where bacteria would ferment them, producing gas.However, there's a drawback to habitually taking Beano to prevent gas.9) Starving your fart-producing bacteria is not a good ideaBacteroides fragilis, one of the bacteria species involved in gas production. (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)For most people, actively trying to limit your gas production isn't necessary, Kaskyap says. The amount you produce is the result of both your balance of gut bacteria and diet, and unless you're experiencing other sorts of problems — such as painful bloating — it's not wise to mess with it.\"The knee-jerk reaction, for many people, is to stop eating things that produce gas,\" he says. \"But these foods, which have complex carbohydrates, are nutrition for the bacteria in our gut. You don't want to starve them unless there's a good reason.\"Additionally, he notes, many people who believe they suffer from excessive gas production actually just have trouble with the flow of that gas through their intestines, perhaps due to constipation. Or, they might make the same amount of gas but emit it more frequently, in smaller doses. In either case, Kashyap says, \"by changing your diet, you're not solving the problem and may in fact be harming yourself.\"Of course, there are exceptions here: if you produce truly excessive amounts of gas or experience painful bloating, it could be a sign of a problem — such as lactose intolerance — and you may want to see a doctor.Further reading: How bacteria in your gut could be making you fat, allergic, or anxious</td>\n",

Break ups happen, especially in the sports world. Travel and time away can drive couples apart. Sometimes you just aren’t right for one another, or you simply grow apart. However, this was not the case with Alexis Sanchez.According to Sanchez’s hometown newspaper, La Cuarta, Alexis broke up with Grassi over issues in the bedroom.An original report had the two breaking up due to Sanchez failing to take the former Miss Chile out for dinner shortly after the World Cup, however, that seemed to not be the case.Alexis Sanchez really wanted to perform well for his new club, so he could not provide what Grassi needed in the bedroom. Apparently, he was saving his energy for the games upcoming. So basically, he broke up with her over the simple fact that he couldn’t have sex with her, says the La Cuarta.Obviously, the commitment to his new club is cool to see. Not many have the dedication to totally give up bedroom needs in order to perform the best they possibly can on the field. Especially when that someone in the bedroom is Laia Grassi, a literal Beauty Queen.Alexis Sanchez is new to Arsenal, which is one of the better football clubs in the world. Obviously, he wants to impress and show that he is as good as any other on the team. The issue with the La Cuarta report is that the same paper claimed not too long ago that Sanchez was under-performing for Arsenal due to having too much sex. That being said, everything could be linked.Could the manager have spoken to Sanchez, telling him to calm it down due to under-performing? Was he not giving himself to his girlfriend because of this reason? It certainly would lead to a break up.Since the break up, Alexis Sanchez has been removed from Grassi’s Instagram account, which many took as an official announcement about the break up. However, at the end of the day, you don’t hear many stories like this. After all, most men would kill to have Sanchez’s life. Regardless, let’s see if the new focus on his game will lead to bigger and better things for Alexis and his club.[IMG Credit: pixgood.com]</td>\n",

              "      <td>CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (MarketWatch) — Investors who are giving the bull market in stocks the benefit of the doubt are playing with fire. That’s because the bear market’s warning signals have created a situation as vulnerable to the slightest spark as a parched desert.The latest warning comes from the so-called High-Low Logic Index. That well-regarded indicator was created by Norman Fosback in 1979, then the president of the Institute for Econometric Research, and currently editor of Fosback’s Fund Forecaster. The index represents the lesser of two numbers from the New York Stock Exchange: new 52-week highs and new 52-week lows (both expressed as a percentage of total issues traded).The indicator, therefore, is a measure of internal market divergences. In his investment textbook “Stock Market Logic,” Fosback reasoned: “Under normal conditions, either a substantial number of stocks establish new annual highs or a large number set new lows — but not both. ... A healthy market requires some semblance of internal uniformity.”By this measure, the current stock market is anything but healthy. The 10-week moving average of weekly readings recently rose to 5.7%, well above the level that many researchers use as the threshold for a “sell” signal. (Fosback, for example, set this threshold at 5%, considering readings above that level as evidence of “extreme market divergence and ... bearish.” The threshold employed by Ned Davis Research, the Venice, Florida-based research firm, is 4.4%.)Why hasn’t this dangerously lofty level of the High Low Logic Index received more attention? There are at least two reasons.The first: The index has a better track record over longer, rather than shorter, spans, and its signals can be premature. Prior to the 2007-2009 bear market, for example, which began in October, the High Low Logic Index breached the 5 threshold in late July. So it’s possible that some of the bulls are worried about the High Low Logic Index but are waiting for confirmation from other indicators before pulling some of their chips off the table.The other reason that some are ignoring these latest warnings is that the index gave a number of false signals in 2013. As you can see from the accompanying chart, in fact, it rose to near 6 in the summer of 2013. (I wrote a column reporting its dangerously high level in August of that year.) Needless to say, the bull market didn’t soon come to an end.You’ll also notice from the chart that the High Low Logic Index rose to an even higher level at the end of last year — hitting 6.9 in late December. It’s too early to know whether that, too, will prove to be a false signal, though I would note that the Dow Jones Industrial Average is lower today than it was then.One adviser who is particularly worried about the message of the High Low Logic Index is Doug Ramsey, Chief Investment Officer of The Leuthold Group. He points out that, unlike the situation that prevailed on the occasion of those false signals a couple of years ago, this time around there also is extreme divergence in the Nasdaq market, in particular.In fact, Ramsey reports that a Nasdaq-only version of the High Low Logic Index just rose above its “sell” threshold for the first time since 2007. I need not remind you what happened at that time.Click here to inquire about subscriptions to the Hulbert Sentiment Indexes.</td>\n",

              "      <td>ITV will be slightly peeved that X Factor hunk Jake Quickenden lost out to veteran motorbike champ Carl Fogarty.After all, it was no accident that he was dropped in to the jungle after the departure of Craig Charles and Gemma Collins.With the stars from the channel’s stellar shows Coronation Street and TOWIE gone, ITV needed someone to represent it and Simon Cowell’s ratings’ behemoth on their biggest programme of the year.Scroll down for video  ITV will be peeved X Factor hunk Jake Quickenden lost out to veteran motorbike champ Carl 'Foggy' Fogarty, although his resemblance to Catweazle could be handy if it's planning a re-makeThe strong favourite since the self-inflicted demise of Jimmy Bullard, Jake ticked all the boxes to go on and be crowned King of The Jungle: handsome, engaging, sweet natured, and safe: pretty and vacant. (Not only had he never heard of Edwina Currie, he beamed proudly ‘I don’t even know what politics is.’)Carl Fogarty on the other hand was a more wizened, slightly jaundiced, old soul. Witness the early episodes when he had no qualms about resisting the idea of feeding the starving camp mates he had left behind in Jungle Jail, declaring bluntly: ‘wherever I go, the food goes.’ As he said he wasn’t really a team player. He also bore a distracting, disturbing resemblance to Catweazle.No doubt Jake will still go on to reap all the rewards he would have if he had won: plenty of appearances on daytime television, some celebrity cooking, a Christmas record, and eventually, some adverts for Iceland.Still, it will (if you’ll pardon the pun) bug him, ITV, and Simon Cowell that he didn’t win.As to why Carl Fogarty won, it principally came down to final day’s trials.The ordeal suffered by the strongest female candidate, Mel Sykes (searching for stars in cloudy water with a few eels etc) may have been popular with male viewers – nothing short of a wet t-shirt contest – but wasn’t daring or terrifying enough to carry her home, despite her claims about how much she hated going underwater.Jake Quickenden’s trial involved the helmet full of creepy crawlies.I'm sure Fogarty won a lot of last-minute votes because he was the celebrity undergoing the eating trialYou could see how much winning meant to the former Superbike champion. The voters obviously figured he deserved itNo doubt Jake will still go on to reap all the rewards he would have if he had won: plenty of appearances on daytime television, some celebrity cooking, a Christmas record, and eventually, some adverts for Iceland‘I always wanted to be an astronaut !’ he smiled, not entirely joking.Obviously, having 1500 cockroaches, 1500 crickets, 10 ‘burrowing cockroaches’, and 200 soldier crabs crawling around your head wasn’t fun, but most of them were scrambling up the sides to get and, asides from the odd nibble, Jake survived relatively painlessly. None of the little critters did what is known on the show as ‘a Fatima Whitbread’ and went up his nose or down his ear.I’m sure Foggy won a lot of last-minute votes because he was the celebrity undergoing the eating trial – which is the one we all want to see and the real reason we all watch IACGMOOH.Having already downed a glass of deer’s blood and some other horrors in the Vile Vineyard challenge, Fogarty duly polished off a cup of mealworms (which were still alive), the anus of an ostrich (not alive), some baked tarantulas, three large cockroaches and a camel’s penis.Yum. I mean, yuck.He may have been the celebrities ‘Tarzan’ figure, a macho motor-biking icon, and the man who took care of the fire and other manly tasks, but you could see even Fogarty didn’t relish eating them. Not as much as Freddie Starr had anyway. The fact he had to dance around as he swallowed them down proved that, practically pogoing at one point.The tarantulas, he said memorably, tasted like ‘dog s**t wrapped in Kentucky,’ which probably rules out that sponsorship deal.For those of you who are interested, he reported ‘the ostrich anus was ‘quite hard and chewy’ and the camel penis ‘had no taste to it.’Fogarty's wife probably regrets the exuberant way she stuck her tongue down his throat before checking he'd brushed his teeth since eating that ostrich anus. A schoolgirl errorWith the current vogue for exotic meat and Heston Blumenthal types in the country’s restaurants, this was a relief - especially for any camels watching.When Ant &amp; Dec announced that Carl had won, Jake looked slightly gutted.‘I couldn’t have won to a better man,’ he stuttered – perhaps a sub-conscious slip as he dreamed of joining such illustrious names as Joe Swash and that bloke from either Westlife or Boyzone last year.We knew what he meant though.You could see how much winning meant to the former Superbike champion although his wife probably regrets the exuberant way she stuck her tongue down his throat before checking he’d brushed his teeth since eating that ostrich anus.But after all that Fogarty had done to be King of the Jungle, the voters obviously figured he deserved it.</td>\n",

              "      <td>A UFO appears to fire a red laser beam toward Earth from outside the International Space Station, in a video excerpted from the live NASA online video feed from the ISS on December 5. But what does NASA have to say about this latest bizarre UFO sighting at the space station?The red laser incident marks the third time since mid October that the NASA video feed has captured what UFO watchers believe to be an alien craft in close proximity to the International Space Station. But while in the previous two sightings the supposed UFO appeared to be merely observing the space station in operation, this time, whatever the entity is — or is not — seems to be taking aggressive action toward our planet.Or is it?NASA has what appears to be a very interesting explanation for the red laser. But first, what do the UFO watchers think they see in the video?“Although red UFOs have been seen near the ISS, witnessing a beam of light from one of then has never been recorded before,” wrote Scott Waring on his popular UFO Sightings Daily site. “Lucky for us, Streetcap1 of Youtube caught this anomaly while watch the NASA cams. He keeps a watchful eye out for any UFOs near the station. The question is, what is that beam and should we be worried about it?“I watch the ISS all the time and almost every day I see something strange that is unexplainable and this is definitely one of them,” wrote one commenter on the site, while another claimed to suffer headaches as a result of sighting an earlier UFO shooting a laser beam.But according to NASA, there’s a very Earthly explanation for the leaser beam in space.The laser beam was actually a test firing of the new Optical Payload for Laser Communcation, or OPALS, system run in part by NASA from its Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California.The purpose of OPALS is to create a new, ultra-high speed communications link between Earth and spacecraft such as the space station.But UFO Sightings Daily editor Scott Waring is not convinced. He says that he is familiar with OPALS, and the laser beam in the video is not it.“I built a laser communicator before DARPA did and I have some experience with it. This laser is not hitting the space station. The lasers I saw were purple, which has a better frequency and higher sound quality than red laser,” Waring wrote on his site. “I have see OPALS at work at the ISS live cam. What I saw was not one, but many lasers hitting the ISS solar panels in a row at the same time.”But if Waring is correct and the laser in the December 5 UFO video is not the NASA OPALS project in action — then what is it?</td>\n",

She sent a text message to the seller:“Hi there. I was wondering if you still have your Nutribullet for sale and if so would you consider posting it? I could pay via PayPal so we’re both protected. I’ve been looking for one for my mom as part of her cancer treatment, but just can’t afford the $200 (retail) price tag. Many thanks! Cara”The seller immediately responded:“I’m sorry to hear your mum has cancer. Just send me your address I will post it to you and you don’t have to pay for it. I also pray for your mum. And if there is anything I can do for you please let me know.”Cara was shocked by the offer, insisting she is willing to pay for the device. She also shared more details about her mother:“Hi! That is so kind but we are honestly willing to pay if you can send us your PayPal address? … Prayers would be greatly appreciated, her cancer is very advanced but we are staying positive and want to give her green juices to help with treatment so we think a Nutribullet would be great! Many thanks, Cara.”That’s when Cara received a text message stating her “FastTrack” order was available for pickup. The seller of the used Nutribullet sent her a message that said:“It’s paid now please collect it today as I don’t want you and your mum to wait for the Nutribullet.”Cara was confused by the text message:“I’m confused. Did you buy a new one? How is it ready today?”The seller responded:“Yes I bought a new one and it’s paid for. You just need to collect it.”The seller had purchased a brand new Nutribullet from a local Argos store. He placed the order in Cara’s name.Cara, obviously overwhelmed, thanked the seller for the kind gesture.The seller responded:“Don’t say thanks to me. In fact, thanks to you for giving me this opportunity.”Cara said she did not believe it until she went to the store and the cashier handed her the brand new Nutribullet. She wrote:“In Argos when I went to collect it thinking it would be some kind of joke. When she handed it to me I cried lol. So had to explain and she was just staring at me open-mouthed!”For those who want to donate to the Duggan family, you can visit their GoFundMe page.Credit: Cara Grace Duggan</td>\n",

              "      <td>Antarctic sea ice is increasing - that's old news - but now it's also thicker than scientists thought, and that's only adding to the confusion.A project to map Antarctic sea ice over the last four years from below using an underwater robot has produced the most detailed images of the sea ice to date, surveying an area of 500,000 square meters, or a fifth of a square mile.For years the expanding sea ice in the Antarctic has been the focus of a lot of research, and a source of controversy, with climate change skeptics claiming it offsets the wide scale melting of Arctic sea ice.That's what Jay Lehr has argued. Lehr is the science director for the Heartland Institute - a conservative think tank that has repeatedly spoken out against climate change science.Lehr said, \"Global warming activists like to claim global consequences resulting from carbon dioxide emissions, yet they conveniently forget to discuss the global nature of polar sea ice data. Instead, they only talk about Arctic sea ice, because that is the only polar region where sea ice is receding\"But scientists say the melting in the Arctic and the expanding ice in the Antarctic don't really balance each other out at all.NASA's Dr. Walt Meier put it this way: \"That's simply not true. If you look at just simply the magnitude of the changes we're seeing in the winter time, the Arctic is decreasing about twice as fast as what the Antarctic is increasing.\"And while scientists haven't pinpointed the main cause of expanding sea ice in the Antarctic, they're not exactly clueless.RiAus's Paul Willis said, \"More rain and snow other effects of climate change could be layering the southern ocean with a cool dense layer on top. Rain and snow could also be freshening the surface waters and thus increasing the local freezing point for sea-ice formation.\"Another possible reason is because Antarctic ice is based around a landmass - the continent of Antarctica - cold winds come off the continent and help form more ice, something that doesn't happen in the Arctic.Adding to the confusion, while Antarctic sea ice is expanding as a whole, there's also a lot of melting going on, at uneven rates.\"Here in the Bellingshausen Sea we find the area of sea ice is shrinking rapidly, compared to other areas of the Antarctic sea ice so therefore we're trying to understand the process of why this area of sea ice in the Bellingshausen sea is reducing,\" said Jeremy Wilkinson.Scientists hope this first survey of sea ice thickness can pave the way for more extensive surveys in the future.</td>\n",

              "      <td>REUTERS/Adam Dean A North Korean soldier looks out from a boat at the bank of the Yalu River at the North Korean town of Sinuiju, October 13, 2006. Whether North Korea was responsible for the Sony hack or not, the consensus is that North Korea has some of the best hackers in the world.There have been some reports recently about North Korea’s special cyber warfare unit, known as Bureau 121. The North Korean government has made grooming its “cyber warriors” a top priority for decades, and has given first class treatment to its hackers.Jang Se-yul, a North Korean defector who now leads an organization called North Korea People’s Liberation Front in Seoul, could have been one of them. Before defecting to South Korea in 2007, Jang went to Mirim University, the country’s top engineering college, which is now called the University of Automation. Although he wasn’t a hacker — his major was War Game Strategy, focused on cyber warfare simulations — Jang took classes with the hackers that are now in Bureau 121. After graduation, Jang worked at North Korea’s General Bureau of Reconnaissance, the intelligence agency that Bureau 121 is a part of. He says he still keeps in touch with some of those hackers.Business Insider had a chance to speak with Jang and hear more about the inner workings of North Korea’s elite hacking force. Here’s what he told us:How they’re trained: Mirim University produces most of the hackers that get placed in Bureau 121. It’s a highly competitive program, with each class accepting only about 100 students out of 5,000 applicants. They take six 90-minute classes every day, learning different coding languages and operating systems, from C to Linux. Jang says a lot of time was spent dissecting Microsoft programs, like the Windows operating system, and how to attack the overall computer IT systems of enemy countries like the US or South Korea. But the core principle is to develop its own hacking programs and computer viruses without having to rely on programs already built in the outside world. Jang says he believes North Korean hackers are as good as the top programmers at Google or CIA, if not already better. “Especially in terms of coding, I’m confident they’re better because they’ve invested in it for so long,” he says.What it’s like to work for Bureau 121: They’re all very sophisticated professional hackers, with almost nine years of intense training by the time they get hired. They’re split into different focus groups based on countries to attack, like the US, South Korea, and Japan. Once they’re placed in their respective groups, they spend nearly two years traveling to their assigned country, learning the language and culture. The ability to travel outside of North Korea and make US dollars is part of the reason so many North Koreans want this job. Jang estimates there are about 1,800 cyber warriors in Bureau 121.Their living conditions are much better than most North Koreans': they receive high salaries, a free apartment over 2,000 sq ft in downtown Pyongyang, and their family can move to Pyongyang as well, which is a big privilege. They’re among the top 1% who are happy with their lives in North Korea. In fact, with free access to the internet, these hackers are all aware of what’s going on in the outside world and how reclusive their country is — but they still won’t leave their country. “No matter how hard you try to convince them, they won’t leave — even if you offered them a job at the Blue House (the official residence of the South Korean president),” Jang says.KCNA The ultimate goal: North Korea realizes they have no chance fighting their enemies in conventional warfare. But in cyber space, they can create chaos with relatively few resources. It’s why the North Korean government has spent so much effort in this area since the 1980s. They call it the “Secret War.” Jang says the ultimate goal is to attack the central IT infrastructure of enemy countries, primarily the government, and steal as much information as possible while also causing social pandemonium. According to Jang, the North Korean hackers say attacking South Korean government servers is like “swimming while touching the ground.” Although he wouldn’t be able to say for sure how advanced their skills are, Jang says the hackers could probably “easily” crack into company servers, too.He also said he’s “absolutely sure” North Korea is behind the Sony hacks. The fact that people are still skeptical of North Korea’s involvement is the very reason North Korea is so focused on cyber attacks: they can cause massive confusion without being definitively fingered.The bigger problem is this is only going to get worse. “The US is definitely not in a safety zone. North Korea’s prepared for this for over 20 years. The U.S. shouldn’t take them lightly,” he said.NOW WATCH: 11 Mind-Blowing Facts About North KoreaMore From Business InsiderSouth Korean Columnist: U.S. Shouldn't Ratchet Tension Up Over 'One Low-Class Comedy Film' North Korean Hackers’ Biggest Strength May Be What They DON'T Have Sony Picked One Of The Worst Possible Times To Release A Movie Making Fun Of North Korea</td>\n",

              "      <td>By Sloane BradshawAt first it was easy for me to point every single finger and toe at my husband for obliterating our 10-year marriage. He's the one who cheated and walked out without looking back. And long before that, he repeatedly shut me out, choosing to bury himself in his work to avoid what was happening to us at home.Blame was my coping mechanism to get through the first difficult months of our separation, and \"how dare he (gasp!)\" was my mantra. I rallied an entire army of supporters who, like me, were totally, utterly and completely aghast at the nerve -- the gall -- of this man.Because obviously being a lying, cheating, family abandon-er trumps anything I did to our marriage in the past decade. Right?Wrong.I deflected any and all culpability in the failure of my marriage for months, holding on to the picture I painted of myself as the gentle, selfless and long-suffering wife. It wasn't until I found a therapist who called me out on my bullsh*t that I was forced to take a long, hard look at my shortcomings.It wasn't pretty.Here's what I now know actually screwed up my marriage. May it serve as a warning to you. Before it's too late.1. I put my children first. It's easy to love your own children. It takes very little effort, and they adore you no matter what. Marriage is the polar opposite: it's work. And whenever my marriage started to feel like work, I would check out and head to Build-A-Bear Workshop or the science museum with the kids in tow. I'd often plan these adventures when I knew my husband couldn't go (and spoil my good time). I told myself it was OK because he preferred to work anyway and always seemed grouchy on family outings. I chose most nights to cuddle with them in our bed, blaming his late-night bedtimes and snoring for the sleeping arrangement. As a result, we were hardly alone together and never had kid-free date nights. Well, maybe once a year on our anniversary.2. I didn't set (or enforce) boundaries with my parents. They were at our house frequently, sometimes arriving unannounced and walking right in. They'd \"help out\" around the house doing things we never asked them to, like folding our laundry (incorrectly, of course). We'd vacation with them. They'd correct our children in front of us. My own fears of upsetting my parents kept me from drawing a line in the sand and asking them not to cross it. The few times I did stand up for my family's autonomy, I didn't hold my parents to the same standards in future. My husband, quite literally, married my entire family.3. I emasculated him. I thought love was about honesty, but we all know that the truth hurts. As we grew more comfortable (read: lazy) in our relationship, I stopped trying to take the sting out it. I talked smack to my girlfriends, my mom, my co-workers. All. The. Time. \"Can you believe he didn't do this?\" and \"Why in God's name did he do THAT?\"Instead of building up his ego, I trampled all over it. I belittled him often, saying his job was unimportant and dismissing his friends as \"hangers-on.\" I berated him for doing things wrong when, in all honesty, he just wasn't doing them my way. At times I spoke to him like a child. I controlled the family finances and grilled him over every single penny he spent. And in the bedroom -- yup, you guessed it -- he was doing that all wrong too, and I wasn't shy about telling him so. As our marriage crumbled, I found myself constantly looking for faults and mistakes so that I could justify my superiority. By the end, I had zero respect for him and I made sure he knew it and felt it every day.4. I didn't bother to learn to fight the right way. I know it sounds odd to suggest there is a right way to fight. But there is. I tended to keep the peace in our house by keeping my mouth shut when things were really bothering me. As you can imagine, all the small things that drove me crazy grew into a giant suppressed ball of anger that would erupt occasionally in a huge, really frightening fit of Hulk-like rage.

(AFP/File)These days, there's neither a shortage of Syrian conflict propaganda, nor is there a lack of international players chiming in. But in case you forgot, a video this week serves as a pretty good reminder.The video itself appears to be from 2013, but was uploaded to YouTube this week. Complete with a video description to \"make short work of Turkish/Israeli jets if they have the balls to interfere with Syrian territories,\" the footage purports to show an example of a Mikoyan MiG-31 fighter jet, six of which have reportedly been delivered ton the Syrian Army from Moscow this week.  According to Iranian state news agency Press TV, the Russian shipment is part of a deal between Moscow and Damascus forged back in 2007. And while neither side has confirmed their role here so far, it's definitely not the first time Russian crafts have shown up on MENA battlefields — Moscow shipped Mi-28 attack helicopters to Baghdad in 2014.It's also not the first time this Russian jet has come up in headlines this year. Large-scale military training operations carried out by the Russian military with the crafts had Western countries worried back in May. Back then, a NATO official told CNN the following on the condition of anonymity.“Three of the [training exercises] have included over 80,000 troops. Some of them have been used to deploy troops to annex Crimea, mass forces on Ukraine’s border and support the [pro-Moscow rebels in Ukraine].”Apparently, now the same could also be true in Syria. And in a war increasingly defined by external players, that could mean big changes for people on the ground.</td>\n",

They chose this article – originally published on Dec. 8 – as a highlight of the pieces that offer trusted advice, inspire provocative conversations, and hopefully add a little fun to your life, every day.What does a night in the life of a dad look like? For 28-year-old Jon Arrigo, who posted a picture on Reddit last week entitled “Just being a dad,” it looks pretty good: Playing video games, snuggling with one daughter while getting his toenails painted by the other.Arrigo posted the photo on December 2, and with nearly 2000 comments, it quickly became one of the top posts of the day. In the photo, the Erie, Pennsylvania, dad is playing a video game, resting his feet on a table covered in stickers while his 3-year-old daughter, Emilia, gives him a multi-colored pedicure. His one-year-old, Kylie, is by his side. \"I rarely post photos, but I thought this was just a funny picture that showed us all doing what we love to do,\" Arrigo tells Yahoo Parenting. \"It really captured what a typical night looks like at our house.\" As a guy who grew up surrounded by brothers and male cousins, he also wanted to show just how much times have changed. “I think the picture shows what being a dad is about,” he says. “There are no barriers like, ‘Oh I can’t do that because I’m a boy and you’re girls.’ They want to do something, we do it.” STORY: Does Dad’s Joke Go Too Far?Responses to the photo were mixed. Some commenters noted that letting his daughter paint his nails demonstrated Arrigo’s willingness to have a little fun. “That’s awesome, no shame in making your kids happy, this warmed my heart up :)” wrote user Sasha_Fire. “I hope so much that if/when my [significant other] and I decide to have children he’s this awesome of a parent,” echoed Kmccain9. But others questioned Arrigo’s choice to play video games instead of engaging with his kids. “This looks less like multitasking and much more like an amazing ability to ignore his kids,” writes Farren246. “I understand kids are infuriating at times but here it looks like they are being well behaved. Why not interact with them a little? The game will be there when they’re in bed,” says HyperactiveToast.STORY: Adorable Way Toddler Announces She’ll Soon Be a Big SisterBut parenting expert and family physician Dr. Deborah Gilboa says people shouldn’t rush to judge a person’s parenting skills from a single photo. “There’s no way to know, on the basis of a picture, if a person is a good or bad parent,” she tells Yahoo Parenting. “But we can say that he is comfortable in his skin and wanted to connect with his daughter.” Parenting isn’t always about sitting on the floor and interacting with our kids, she says. Sometimes just being in the same room is enough. “Sometimes we play with our kids and sometimes we are simply with our kids, and that really is ok.”And while Gilboa says there’s no way to know what’s going on in a family from one picture, what she takes from the photo is the impression of a father who lets his kids express themselves. “They were clean and comfortable and have a cool table with stickers,” she says. “At least he didn’t kick anyone out of the room and say ‘don’t bother me I’m playing video games.’”</td>\n",

              "      <td>A slight change in the process used to prepare tomatoes for sale could make them tastier. (Daniel Acker/Bloomberg)If you've ever compared a farm-fresh heirloom tomato to the average fruit from a grocery store, you know the latter is a pale substitution. But by slightly tweaking the way tomatoes are prepared for sale, scientists say, they can make them just a bit yummier. The key is giving tomatoes a nice hot soak before they head to the store.Tomatoes in the grocery store aren't generally freshly picked. They've been shipped from another location, spending days or weeks in storage to make it to store shelves. And that means that they weren't actually red and ripe when they were picked -- if they had been, they'd be a rotten mess by the time they arrived.[The mad science behind vegetable grafting]So tomatoes are picked green and ripened at the opportune moment using a gas called ethylene. It's totally natural -- it's the gas that tomatoes, apples, bananas, and other fruits release when they ripen, and its presence signals other fruits nearby to get going -- but what comes after is no good for your taste buds: Once the fruits have been perfectly ripened, they're stored in the cold to keep them from going bad.It turns out that the lower temperatures really degrade fruit flavor. At the National Meeting &amp; Exposition of the American Chemical Society this week, researchers presented a simple solution: Just give the fruit a nice, hot bath beforehand.[Strawberries are in big trouble. Scientists race to find solution.]In the experiment, which was led by researchers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, and the University of Florida, Florida-grown tomatoes were dipped in hot water (about 125 degrees Fahrenheit) for five minutes before getting the same chilly treatment as the other tomatoes.The hot bath seemed to mitigate some of the tasteless effects of the chilling. Important flavor compounds -- the chemicals that give tomatoes their taste -- were more abundant in the experimental tomatoes, even after they'd been chilled and stored.The researchers are working on figuring out whether other techniques -- one that caught the tomatoes earlier in the production process, or allowed them to ripen on the vine for a bit longer without risking decay en route to their final destination -- might make tomatoes taste even better.Read More:Why nuking frozen veggies might be healthier than poaching fresh greensStrawberries are in big trouble.

              "      <td>AP Photo /Martin Meissner, fileAn ALDI market in Gelsenkirchen, Germany.Chances are that you have never set foot inside the best grocery store in America: Aldi. And even if you are lucky enough to be in one of the 32 states where Aldi is, perhaps you were put-off by the cardboard boxes in lieu of shelves, or the row upon row of suspicious-looking off-brands. What is this place? Why do I have to put down a deposit to check out a cart? What is the weird giant shelf by the exit? And what do you mean, I have to pay for a bag?Calm your hormones, meine Schatzis: Aldi, which is short for Albrecht Discount, is the American incarnation of a German grocery chain that is so ubiquitous in the Vaterlandthat almost 90 percent of Germans shop there. (Not all German imports are luxury cars, beer, and super-cool glasses.)Aldi is part of a charming subset of Teutonic trade: the brother-run company that cleaves in twain. Shoe aficionados already know the story of the Dassler brothers, Adolf and Rudolf, whose bitter feud resulted in the creation of Adidas and Puma. (Germans pronounce Adidas differently— some might say correctly — AH-dee-das, fromAdi Dassler.) But outside Germany, few know about grocery-store kingpins Karl and Theo Albrecht (who was kidnapped in 1971!)—even though Karl, with a reported net worth of more than 17 billion euros, is the richest man in Germany (Theo’s descendants are a close second).The Brüder founded their discount-store empire together. A disagreement in 1960 over selling cigarettes hastened a partition, and an epic game of grocery-store Risk: Theo would rename his business Aldi Nord, and would control territories north of the Rhine, plus a healthy chunk of Europe. Karl would head up Aldi Süd, and get southern Germany, more of Europe, plus the U.K. and Ireland. But both companies operate stores in the United States — Aldi Süd operates as Aldi, and Aldi Nord as the now ubiquitous Trader Joe’s.But whereas Trader Joe’s employs just one major cost-saving device — private labeling —everything else about it is Americanized. The place is swarming with upbeat employees; cashiers stand at the till and bag your products for you; you just grab a cart willy-nilly and they trust you to put it back. Aldi also private-labels (those $1.99 “Millville” Rice Squares are Chex, you guys!), but what makes it a more exciting venture — and even cheaper than Trader Joe’s—is that it has imported the entire German grocery experience (aside, alas, from employees yelling at you if you do something wrong).If you’ve ever visited Germany, you’ve noticed that a 4-ounce glass of juice at a restaurant may run you $10, while groceries — often of much higher quality than their American counterparts—will be noticeably less expensive. This is in part because of cost-cutting shopping practices whose arrival stateside I greet with a robust “Wunderbar!”You can always tell an American in Germany by the way they incredulouslydon’t get that nobody is going to bag their groceries for them — they’re expected to do so (and schnell!) while the seated cashier is ringing them up. Shoppers also have the option of quickly sticking wares back into the cart and schlepping them over to a special low, wide shelf that’s an official bagging area. As for the cart: It requires a deposit, and customers must return them to their rightful place —without the help of an employee — if they want their money back.These are standard practices at even upscale German Supermärkte, so high-end groceries are cheaper relative to other goods than they are here. This is why I am hoping for Aldi’s rousing success in Amiland: so that more of our stores, and our culture in general, will incorporate such Teutonic efficiency. First the cost-savings of bagging our own groceries — then the ubiquitous bicycle lanes; immaculate, punctual public transportation; and, finally, required paid vacation and parental leave. It would be ausgezeichnet indeed, meine Lieben.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Excerpted from Uniquely Human: A Different Way of Seeing Autism.The first thing I noticed about Jesse was the fear and anxiety in his eyes.I was visiting a small New England school district when I heard about an eight-year-old boy who had recently transferred from a nearby district. There he had earned a dubious distinction: administrators called Jesse the worst behavior problem they had ever encountered.It wasn’t difficult to understand why, given his challenges. Jesse, a sturdy boy with straight brown hair and wire-rimmed glasses, struggled with severe social anxiety, extreme sensitivity to touch, and difficulty processing language. He also had a seizure disorder that was detected when he was a toddler, about the time he lost the ability to speak. He communicated with little more than guttural sounds and grunts, pushing away people and objects or physically leading people to what he wanted.Since it was so difficult for Jesse to make his needs known, he often seemed aggravated and miserable. He sometimes took out his frustration and anxiety on himself, pounding his fists against his thighs and his forehead, covering his body with bruises. When teachers tried to direct him from one activity to the next, he often reacted with flailing limbs or by pushing them away with his arms or legs. Reports from the previous school described kicking, scratching, and biting episodes escalating into fits so severe that almost daily, three or four adults had to pin the boy down to subdue him, then isolate him in a “time-out” room.The staff had interpreted all of this as willful, uncooperative behavior. But Jesse’s mother knew better. She understood that his actions were his way of communicating—a direct reflection of his confusion, agitation, and fear. When she explained to the administrators that her son struggled with sensory challenges that made him unusually sensitive to loud noises and being touched, they had been dismissive. Clearly, they insisted, the boy was displaying noncompliant behavior. In their eyes, Jesse was strong-willed, stubborn, and defiant, and their response was to try to break him—to treat him as a trainer would treat a horse.What did these educators offer to help Jesse learn to communicate? Practically nothing. The district’s policy was to focus first on controlling a child’s behavior, and, only after achieving success, to address the area of communication.They had it all wrong.I had heard so many awful things about Jesse that I was intrigued to come face-to-face with him. When I finally did, I didn’t observe any of what I had heard described—not the defiance, not the aggression, not the willful disobedience. What I saw was a boy who was understandably frightened, anxious, and constantly on guard. And I saw something else: Jesse’s extreme vigilance and anxiety were manifestations of the inevitable damage that occurs when people— however well meaning—completely misunderstand the behavior of individuals with autism.How does this happen? The short answer is that caregivers neglect to ask “Why?” They don’t listen carefully or observe closely. Instead of seeking to understand the child’s perspective and experience, they simply try to manage the behavior.Unfortunately this behavioral-assessment approach—that is, using a checklist of deficits—has become the standard way of determining whether a person has autism. We say a child has autism if he displays a combination of traits and behaviors that are deemed to be problematic: difficulty in communicating, trouble developing relationships, and a restricted repertoire of interests and behaviors, including repetitive speech—known as echolalia—and actions, such as rocking, arm flapping, and spinning. Professionals observe these “autistic behaviors” and then assess the people who display them by using a sort of circular reasoning: Why does Rachel flap her hands? Because she has autism. Why has she been diagnosed with autism? Because she flaps.Following this approach means defining a child as the sum of his deficits. How best to help such a child? By managing those behaviors or attempting to get rid of them: to halt the rocking, to squelch the echoing speech, to reduce the flapping. And what denotes success? The more we can make a child look and act “normal,” the better.This way of understanding and supporting people with autism is sorely lacking. It treats the person as a problem to be solved rather than an individual to be understood. It fails to show respect for the individual and ignores that person’s perspective and experience. It neglects the importance of listening, paying close attention to what the person is trying to tell us, whether through speech or patterns of behavior.On top of that, in my experience it doesn’t work—and often makes things worse.What’s more helpful is to dig deeper: to ask what is motivating these behaviors, what is underlying these patterns. It’s more appropriate, and more effective, to ask “Why?” Why is she rocking? Why does he line up his toy cars that way, and why only when he arrives home from school? Why does he stare at his hands fluttering in front of his eyes, and always during English class and recess? Why does she repeat certain phrases when she is upset?The Challenge of DysregulationUsually the answer is that the person is experiencing some degree of emotional dysregulation. When we are well regulated emotionally, we are most available for learning and engaging with others. We all strive to be alert, focused, and prepared to participate in activities in our daily lives. Our neurological systems help by filtering out excessive stimulation, telling us when we’re hungry or tired or when to protect ourselves from danger. People with autism, primarily due to underlying neurology (the way the brain’s wiring works), are unusually vulnerable to everyday emotional and physiological challenges. So they experience more feelings of discomfort, anxiety, and confusion than others. They also have more difficulty learning how to cope with these feelings and challenges.To be clear: Difficulty staying well regulated emotionally and physiologically should be a core, defining feature of autism. Unfortunately professionals have long overlooked this, focusing on the resulting behaviors instead of the underlying causes.If you know a person with autism, consider what makes this person less able to stay well regulated: problems in communicating, environments that are chaotic, people who are confusing because they talk or move too quickly, unexpected change, excessive worry about things that are uncertain. Then there are associated challenges, such as sensory sensitivities to touch and sound, motor and movement disturbances, sleep deprivation, allergies, and gastrointestinal issues.Of course people with autism aren’t alone in experiencing these challenges. We all feel dysregulated from time to time. Speaking in front of a large audience, you might feel sweat collecting on your brow, your hands might quiver, your heart might race. Wearing a scratchy wool sweater might be so irritating that you can’t focus. When your normal morning routine—coffee, newspaper, shower— is thrown off by an unexpected intrusion, you might feel out of sorts for the rest of the morning. When these factors accumulate—you miss sleep, you’re under a deadline, you skip lunch, and then your computer crashes—it’s easy to become extremely agitated.We all have these challenges, but people with autism are unusually ill equipped to deal with them because of their neurology. That makes them far more vulnerable than others—that is, their threshold can be much lower—and they have fewer innate coping strategies. In many cases, they also have sensory-processing differences: they are either highly sensitive or undersensitive to sound, light, touch, and other sensations and therefore less able to manage. In addition many people with autism are innately unaware of how others might interpret their actions when they are dysregulated.Feeling emotionally dysregulated affects different people in different ways. Often the reactions are immediate and impulsive. A child’s behavior may shift suddenly, with no apparent cause. When a child is exposed to a loud noise, for instance, he might drop to the floor. I often see children refuse to enter a gym class or the school cafeteria. Their teachers might mistakenly believe that this is willful disobedience, a planned attempt to escape an activity the child doesn’t enjoy. The reason is typically much deeper than that: the child can’t bear the volume or quality of the noise or the chaos of the setting.When I worked in a preschool autism program based in a hospital, the children ate lunch in the classroom on trays brought up from the hospital cafeteria. Once a teacher and I led the four- and five-year-olds to the cafeteria’s kitchen so they could see how the trays were cleaned. At exactly the moment we arrived, the industrial-size dishwasher spewed forth steam and suddenly emitted a high-frequency SSSHHHH! Instantly all the children dropped their trays, some covered their ears and screamed, and they ran for the exit. It was as if a monster had suddenly appeared, inches from their faces.That’s dysregulation, sudden and visible.Sometimes the cause of dysregulation is less obvious. While visiting a preschool where I consulted, I was walking outdoors with Dylan, a four-year-old with autism, when suddenly and without warning, he dropped to the ground and refused to proceed. I gently picked him up and helped him along, but soon he dropped again. As I helped him again, we heard a dog barking. He immediately panicked and tried to run away from the sound. It dawned on me that Dylan, with his hypersensitive hearing, had heard the dog all along, but its bark had been so distant that it hadn’t registered with me. What might have appeared as uncooperative, random, or defiant behavior was in fact a very understandable expression of fear.That too is dysregulation.Many children with autism flap their arms, either as an expression of their level of excitement or to calm themselves. When Conner felt joyful, and sometimes when he was anxious about a transition between activities, he did what his parents called his “happy dance.” He stood on his toes and stepped forward, then back, while flicking his fingers in front of his eyes. An earlier therapist had advised Conner’s parents to respond with a firm “Hands down!” And if he didn’t comply: “Sit down, sit on hands!” (To their credit, his parents ignored the suggestion, instead helping Conner to label his feelings or easing transitions by telling him what to expect.)It’s easy to dismiss flapping or rocking or dancing as just so much “autistic behavior.” But parents raising children with autism, and the professionals who work with them, need to take an extra step. Like detectives, we need to examine and consider all available clues and work to discern what is underlying or triggering a particular reaction. What is making the child dysregulated? Is it internal or external? Is it visible? Is it in the sensory realm? Is it pain, or physical discomfort, or a traumatic memory? In most cases the child can’t explain the behavior in words, so it’s up to those close to him to sort through the clues.Coping Strategies and Regulating BehaviorsHere is the important irony: Most of the behaviors commonly labeled “autistic behaviors” aren’t actually deficits at all. They’re strategies the person uses to feel better regulated emotionally.In other words, in many cases they’re strengths.When a child with extreme sensory sensitivities enters a noisy room and cups his hands over his ears and rocks his body, this pattern of behavior is simultaneously a sign of dysregulation and a coping strategy. You could call it “autistic behavior.” Or you could ask “Why is he doing that?” The answer is twofold: the child is revealing that something is amiss and that he has developed a response to shut out what is causing him anxiety.Whether or not we realize it, all humans employ these rituals and habits to help us regulate ourselves—soothe ourselves, calm our minds and bodies, and help us cope. Perhaps, like many people, you find public speaking unnerving. To calm yourself, you might take a series of deep breaths or pace back and forth while you speak. That’s not exactly the way humans typically breathe or behave in public, but an observer would not judge this as deviant behavior. The person would understand that it’s your way to cope with the stress of the situation and to soothe your nerves so that you can do your best.When I return home from a day of work, I immediately check the mailbox, then sort the mail, placing bills in one pile, magazines in another, and tossing what I don’t need in the recycling bin. It would take a significant distraction for me to skip that small but important ritual; then I would feel out of sorts on some level until I took care of it. It’s a calming routine; it’s how I come home. When my wife has had a bad day or feels worried, she organizes and cleans. If I come home and find our home more immaculate than usual, I know that something is bothering her. Religious services include layers of comforting rituals—chanting and praying, symbolic gestures and body movements—to enable people to let go of the worries and trivialities of everyday life and enter a higher spiritual realm.For people with autism, comforting rituals and coping mechanisms come in all varieties: moving in particular ways, speaking in various patterns, carrying familiar items, lining up objects to create predictable and unchanging surroundings. Even proximity to certain people can serve as a regulating strategy.Excerpted from Uniquely Human: A Different Way of Seeing Autism by Barry M. Prizant with Tom Fields-Meyer.

According to Wojnarowski, the Sixers have said they'd be accommodating to Kirilenko's family issue and they believe Philadelphia's proximity to New York allows them to help him. Kirilenko, meanwhile, seemingly has no interest in playing for lottery-bound team, and as a free agent this summer, he probably doesn't want to risk injury in meaningless games.If the situation becomes dire enough, Philadelphia can actually mandate that Kirilenko come play for them.According to Wojnarowski, the Sixers probably have little interest in keeping Kirilenko past the trade deadline, but by getting him to play, it could possibly increase his trade value, thus making him an asset for the 76ers to use.Kirilenko hasn't played since November 13.More From Business InsiderNBA POWER RANKINGS: Where Every Team Stands Going Into 2015 The 49 Most Mesmerizing Sports Photos Of 2014 WHERE ARE THEY NOW?

Halle is trying to reduce Gabriel's child support for 6-year-old Nahla from $16K a month to around $3,800 a month. Gabriel refers to the Thanksgiving day fight in Halle's driveway back in 2012, in which he accuses Olivier Martinez of a sneak attack that pulverized his face. He says it took him 6 months to heal before he could possibly work again, and since then he's only gotten 3 gigs. But we checked out photos of Gabriel, and just 6 weeks after the fight there's barely a sign of injury. Halle attacks Gabriel as a deadbeat who is using child support to avoid having to work. She says, \"There is no case, no law, no logic that says a healthy, active man gets to simply live off child support that the wealthier mother earns.\" And in Halle's docs, her lawyer, Steve Kolodny, says Gabriel uses monthly child support for his own needs, including: $740 a month for Gabriel's \"Fitness\"   $940 a month in clothing (Gabriel lists Nahla's clothing expenses separately -- $675 a month) $700 a month for Gabriel's health insurance $1,975 a month in car expenses $1,100 a month in furniture and electronics Halle splits custody with Gabriel 50/50.

              "      <td>You’ve cleared the afternoon to write the speech for your best friend’s wedding.As soon as you sit down, your mind wanders to the street outside your window; the sound of the faucet dripping in the sink; the empty refrigerator. You were supposed to buy groceries. You get up and check the fridge. A glistening bottle of seltzer water in the back makes you realize you’re thirsty. You pour yourself a glass. While sipping, your mind wanders back to the speech.You sit back down, determined to focus this time.If you have ADHD, or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, this might seem like a familiar scenario: You’re used to having relatively simple tasks feel excruciatingly difficult. But while most of us tend to focus on the negatives of ADHD, some of the characteristics we associate with the disorder, from impulsivity to an inability to follow directions, can have some surprising benefits too.1. Being PerceptiveOkay, so your short attention span could mean  that wedding speech will never get written. But being incapable of zeroing in on a single thing might also help you pick up on changes in your surroundings that others might not notice. This could come in especially handy when your job — or even your life — depends on noticing such a change. Say you and some friends are camping, for example. While most of the gang is busy roasting marshmallows, you notice a bear heading straight toward your campground. Your inability to focus on making s'mores just saved your life.Recent research suggests that this kind of behavior may have played a role in how we evolved: Some of our nomadic ancestors had ADHD-like characteristics, too. These people would have been quick to notice changes to their natural environment — such as a stream drying up or an approaching predator — and alerted their family members in time for them to find new sources of water or plan an escape.Thank you, easily-distracted nomads.2. Thinking CreativelyMost bosses, teachers, and parents agree: Having an employee, student, or child who can't follow directions can be infuriating. But an inability to do what one is told might also enable someone with ADHD to come up with creative solutions to problems that others would never dream of.Recent research backs up that idea. In two studies ( one of children and one of adults ), participants with ADHD came up with more novel ideas than those without the disorder.In one test of children who were tasked with coming up with new toy designs, those with ADHD came up with a far more diverse array of different types of toys than those without ADHD. Similarly, i n another test of adults who were asked to think of as many uses as possible for a common object, such as a cup or a brick, those with ADHD outperformed those without it.However, when the adults were given other tasks to test creativity, such as one in which they had to  find something in common amongst three seemingly unrelated items (such as the words  mines, lick, and sprinkle)  those with ADHD performed worse than those without it.3. Expressing EmotionMany people with ADHD also have a hard time controlling their emotions. Researchers aren't sure yet whether this experience is part of ADHD or a separate condition. If you have what's known as emotional dysregulation, you rarely feel apathetic. Whether you're sad, upset, or elated, your emotions tend to be strong and straightforward. While some people might label you emotional, others — especially close friends — might appreciate your tendency to share how you're feeling. And recent research suggests that allowing ourselves to feel emotions as they happen helps us process them and prepare for the future.People with emotional dysregulation also tend to have a hard time recognizing others' emotions and sometimes misinterpret them as a result. While this could certainly be a challenge to forming healthy relationships, research suggests that people can compensate for it with clear communication.4. Tackling Specialized JobsOverall, these characteristics might make people with ADHD better suited than the rest of us for jobs that take advantage of their flexibility and impatience.\"In the right environment, these traits are not a disability, and can be a real asset,\" Weill Cornell Medical College clinical psychiatry professor Richard A. Friedman suggested in a recent op-ed for The New York Times.Jobs that require frequent travel, such as journalism and photography, or positions that require frequently switching from one type of task to another, could be well suited to people who have many of the characteristics associated with ADHD. One of Friedman's patients, he writes, saw a decline in his ADHD symptoms after he switched from a desk job to a position in a start-up where his work environment was constantly changing.More From Business InsiderHere’s Why ADHD May Have Been An Evolutionary Advantage Exercise May Be The Most Effective ADHD Medicine America's Poorest Toddlers Are Being Wildly Over-Prescribed ADHD Drugs</td>\n",

The beautiful dog, who is estimated to be between two and three years of age, does not have one special person to devote her attention to, or a favorite, cozy bed to curl up upon.Instead, she calls the Burlington County Animal Shelter in Westampton, New Jersey, \"home.\"The non-profit organization, Friends of Burlington County Animal Shelter, is hoping that Nikki can find her special someone and finally leave the facility and start the life that she was always meant to lead. The volunteer-led group wrote:Nikki has been in a cage since 7/2013. She is good with other dogs and does well in our play groups with dogs that like to play, she is considered a HELPER dog because she gets along so well with so many other dogs. She is great with all age kids but not cats.Nikki gets so excited when visitors approach her cage that most people tend to simply pass her over...her happiness and excitment is met with rejection.The group wrote:She is a happy and loving girl who begs for a chance to be noticed and have a home. Have seen her in the play yard with a family with a 5mth old that she just laid there and let her pet her, then she got up and played ball with the 9 yr old and then had a run with the dad. She is a small girl and doesn't take up much room. She knows 'sit,' gives paw, and loves to play fetch.

              "      <td>Chinese leader Xi Jinping knows something Barack Obama doesn’t: America is finished. The U.S. economy is an ocean liner holed below the waterline. In the stateroom, the band plays on – but, on the bridge, the outcome is clear.With the arguable exception of the late-era Soviet Union, America is sinking faster than any Great Power in history.As a proportion of national output, America’s foreign debts are already larger than those of any Great Power since the rotten-to-the-core Ottoman empire a century ago. For those who need reminding, the Ottoman empire, which had flourished for more than six centuries, was then within a decade of final collapse.Because every dollar of current-account deficit (the current account is the largest and most meaningful measure of trade) represents an extra dollar that has to be funded from abroad, America’s foreign indebtedness is now accumulating at a rate of more than $1 billion a day.There is no way America can export itself back to national solvency. As Xi Jiping knows only too well, this is a matter of technology. As soon as American corporations come up with a more efficient new production technology, they ship it to China or elsewhere overseas where it will boost the productivity of foreign workers. Any corporation that wants to sell in China must not only manufacture there but bring its best technology. Then it is expected to export back to the United States. All this means that the American economy has passed the tipping point. It is now simply too hollowed out to make a recovery.  Even apparently solid U.S. manufacturers like Boeing Boeing, Caterpillar Caterpillar, and Corning Glass have long since sourced many of their most advanced components and materials from Japan, Korea, Germany, and other manufacturing-focused nations. (For a closer look at Boeing, click here and here. Much of Boeing’s most valuable technology has long since been transferred to East Asia, not least its avionics and its incomparable wing technology.)In proceeding full steam ahead towards national bankruptcy, the United States is world history’s ultimate example of the triumph of ideology over commonsense. Beginning in the Eisenhower era, succeeding Washington administrations have bet the farm on ever-freer trade. Supposedly this would strengthen American economic leadership. To say the least, the powers that be in Tokyo, Seoul, and Taipei, as well as in Bonn, Frankfurt, and West Berlin, discreetly laughed at such epochal naïveté.No nation has understood the stupidity of America’s trade policy more clearly than post-Mao China. On the one hand, American leaders have thrown the U.S. market wide open to Chinese exports. On the other, they have ignored Beijing’s in-your-face blocking of virtually all advanced American exports to China. The United  States has been by far the most serious victim of  Chinese protectionism.Barack Obama meets the Great Wall of Chinese protectionism. (Photo credit: Wikipedia)As Chinese leaders know better than anyone, the ultimate issue is American corruption. Washington is actually far more corrupt than Beijing. If you want to get something done in Washington, you do what you do in Jakarta: just slip some money to the right people. The point was made as far back as a generation ago by the prominent Japanese commentator and author Shintaro Ishihara.  From an East Asian point of view, the United States is already, in its political dynamics, a Third World country. Even South Korea, with just one-seventh of America’s population, is a bigger exporter to China than the United States. On a per-capita basis, South Korea’s China exports are eight times larger than America’s. Korea’s exports moreover consist almost entirely of leading First World goods such as highly miniaturized electronic components, whereas the main things America sells to China are Third World-ish items such as iron ore, coal, and wheat.This is not to suggest that American brands are absent from China. Actually they are everywhere. But virtually all American-brand goods sold in China are made there — using American production knowhow that, in some cases, has taken the American nation generations to build up. In an egregious sell-out of the American national interest, U.S. corporations now  almost reflexively comply with China’s  technology  demands. Unlike their peers in places like Korea, Japan, Germany, and Taiwan, they have not had much choice: whereas other nations’ governments stand behind their corporations and work hard to stem the leakage abroad of key production technologies, Washington lets the “wisdom” of the market prevail.As the New York Times has pointed out, a current example concerns Intel and Qualcomm, which have very similar technologies that China is angling to acquire. From Beijing’s point of view, it is taking candy from a baby. The two American companies can be pitted against one another in the certainty that one or other will soon cave. It is the group versus the individual and in a well-organized groupist society, the group always prevails.There is a one-way valve here. Key production technologies leak out of the United States: they don’t leak in. Other nations have industrial policies  to make sure that their most productive technologies stay at home. By contrast in a latter-day America, corporations have no national loyalty and they  have every reason to transfer their technologies abroad. That way they can aim to earn brownie points with foreign governments, not least the communist regime in Beijing. Their executives also max out their stock options.Eamonn Fingleton is the author of In Praise of Hard Industries: Why Manufacturing, Not the Information Economy, Is  the Key To Future Prosperity (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1999).</td>\n",

              "      <td>Let’s formulate the task of life extension slightly differently. Something like this…How can we extend sex appeal?Gyms and beauty salons are in charge of this question now. There is some success, but it’s mostly superficial. Plastic surgery only masks, but doesn’t delay the processes of aging.Expanding sex appeal is a complex task. Its aspects include both beauty and the activity of the brain. To be sexually attractive we have to be smart and fun. One cannot solve the problem of dementia with makeup. We have to be in an excellent physical shape to be sexually attractive, but also things should be running smoothly with our hormonal regulation.The task of extending the period of sex appeal is extremely science-intensive. It is not only the Viagra, but a complex impact on the whole organism. It is obvious that molecular biology is responsible for sex in the modern world.What do we know so far? Biological studies of various aspects of sexuality are on very different stages.In some areas, like rejuvenating skin and muscle, science is on the verge of inventing effective therapies.In other areas, like rejuvenating the brain, for example, the first fundamental discoveries have been done just very recently. I’d like to mention several “growth points” that may become key in extending sex appeal.1. Creating artificial stem cell niches for skin rejuvenation. Interestingly, stem cell niches can be used for stimulating hair growth. 2. Studying the possibility to rejuvenate muscle satellite cells to fight sarcopenia and restore muscle tone and strength. 3. Identifying the systemic factors that facilitate rejuvenation in parabiosis (that’s when two animals share their blood systems). This model demonstrated how not only the muscle, but also the nervous system could be improved. 4. Hormonal regulation, but not using the hormone replacement therapy, but rather stimulating the endocrine glands directly. 5. The impact of diet on health.I’d like to highlight a very powerful solution in improving ‪sexuality – it’s gene therapy.Right now many issues are being dealt with in this area ranging from the choice of nucleic acid intracellular delivery systems to increasing safety. However, I’m quite confident that the biological nature of human being will be radically improved and you cannot avoid using gene therapy for these applications.Rejuvenating hypothalamus and delivering ‪telomerase gene into various tissues get the most attention when we are talking about extending sexuality.I’d like to note that there will be an explosive growth in the area of rejuvenating technologies soon. Out of 200+ papers, published in the Nature Journal on the topic of rejuvenation, more than 100 date within the last 2.5 years.I am planning to write several posts about interesting research and trends in the area of extending ‪sex appeal.</td>\n",

His revelation regarding the real condition of Manny Pacquiao was also featured on TV Patrol, one of the best news programs in the Philippines aside from a tweet of ANC or ABS-CBN News Channel that says Manny is just doing light boxing training to make sure that he will not be overworked.YouTube/enterthearenausSaid report has received mix reactions from the netizens who have been following his colorful boxing career since his “Blow By Blow” days. “Manny should continue to train hard to make sure that he will win against Algieri on Nov. 22,” said Cory Spawn, one of the Facebook users who commented on the issue. “It’s good to know that Manny is now already in shape and ready to face his opponent in the ring. I truly believe, he will demolish the unbeaten junior welterweight champ,” Garry Fazzonella said.But while the netizens were talking about the PacMan’s condition, hall of fame boxing promoter and Top Rank CEO Bob Arum was busy giving his opinion on the rumored mega fight between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao. Based on his statement, the mega fight is still impossible to happen despite other people’s claim that it will be seen at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada on May 2015 because he (Bob Arum) believes that Floyd Mayweather is not willing to face the former pound for pound king in the ring.\"How can I talk for Mayweather. I mean, as far as the Pacquiao fight is concerned with Mayweather, as much as a lot of people surrounding that would want it to happen, myself included, Manny included, Floyd Mayweather is reluctant to fight Manny Pacquiao, period. If people don't see that by now, they're never going to see,\" Bob Arum told reporters during a conference call for the scheduled Pacquiao-Algieri bout.A lot of people are expecting Floyd Mayweather to say something about the issue to clear the issue once and for all, but unfortunately, he is still undecided to share his positive opinion on the matter. On the other hand, if Floyd continues to ignore the issue, Manny Pacquiao is different; he’s telling everyone that a fight with Floyd Mayweather is one of his specific goals in life.</td>\n",

              "6     Michelle Obama is furious after finding out about her husband’s secret love nest, according to a new report.In another article from the National Enquirer tabloid about alleged problems in the Obama marriage, a source is quoted as saying “Michelle found out about his secret love nest and exploded in fury!”“Despite the happy public face the family is putting out, it’s created the holiday from hell!” the insider added in the unverified story.“In early December, Michelle confronted Barack about a secret location he’s been using to meet up with women. She verbally ripped him to pieces. Barack didn’t have much of a comeback. He knows he’s been ratted out.”Multiple alleged insiders assert Barack has a secret love nest inside the Jefferson Hotel, which is just a few blocks from the White House. He apparently utilizes a door in the hotel’s private wine cellar to come and go without being seen.“”The ‘commander-in-cheat,’ as he’s known at the place, comes and goes so frequently that some hotel staffers call the door he uses the ‘Barack entrance,’” one source claimed.“It’s easy for the president to get to and best of all, it has a secret entrance so he can come and go discreetly.”First lady Michelle Obama reads “Twas the night before Christmas” to patients, families, and staff at Children’s National Health System in Washington, Monday, Dec. 15, 2014. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)The report comes just a few weeks after the Enquirer alleged that Michelle told Barack to “get out” of their home after she saw him hitting on an engaged woman while on a campaign stop in Chicago.Shortly before that, Globe magazine claimed that the Obama’s marriage is a “sham” and that it was about to come to a “startling end” because Barack had been caught seeking after “yet another” married Hollywood actress.Like this:Related

              "11    Source: Pokemon.comThe new Pokémon games start how all Pokémon games start: You play as a boy or girl who begins collecting adorable monsters and training them to fight. But before you call PETA, you should know that in the world of Pokémon, this is all in good fun. Matches end when a Pokémon faints, and no one really gets hurt.At a glance, it would seem that these games are strictly for kids. The primary reason for this, of course, is that they are for kids — or at least, that’s who they’re meant to appeal to. What you might not realize unless you look past the cartoonish veneer, however, is that Pokémon games are intricately designed experiences that are every bit as deep and complex as the latest Final Fantasy or Call of Duty. Pokémon is just more accessible.This year’s dual installments are Pokémon Omega Ruby and Pokémon Alpha Sapphire (aka ORAS). Instead of being entirely new installments, ORAS are remakes of Game Boy Advance games from 2003. That might sound like they’re intended to be a quick and easy cash-in to get new Pokémon titles on the market in time for Christmas, but really they’re not.The games — which are nearly identical, aside from a few exclusive Pokémon and slightly different antagonists — have received a total graphical makeover and have gotten many much-needed updates to make the games fit into the modern Pokémon landscape.You play as a boy or girl whose family has just moved to the Hoenn region of the Pokémon world, and you want to become a trainer. There doesn’t appear to be much else to do in the world of Pokémon, since Pokémon are all most people talk about, and about a third of the people you meet are also trainers.Anyway, once you start your new hobby, you take off on a journey to explore the region, collecting all the Pokémon you can, training them to become powerful fighters, taking on gym leaders, and thwarting a criminal plot along the way. It’s all standard stuff for a Pokémon game, but no one really plays Pokémon for the story. You play it because it’s a blast.

              "13    The best fireworks display you'll ever see was an accident.Video uploaded to YouTube this week shows a massive fireworks cache exploding earlier this year in Italy.The spectacular display shows hundreds, perhaps thousands, of fireworks exploding in the air at the same time while multiple explosions occur on the ground.The incident is believed to have occurred in July. It is not known if there were any injuries.A thick wall of what appears to be vines separates spectators from the explosions, likely shielding any of them from serious harm.The person taking the video simply hunkered down and caught as much as he could.According to Reddit user Bartjay, most Italian fireworks are \"shot the traditional way, meaning no electrical fuse ... every pyrotechnical article has to be lit manually.\"Accordingly, u [sic] will have a lot of open fuses, which are prone to go off if there is a flop.\"It is easy to see how one misfired firework could result in such a stunning display if all those fuses are out in the open waiting patiently to be lit.The computerized systems used for fireworks displays in the U.S. are not flawless, though.A computer glitch at a 2012 fireworks display in San Diego resulted in every firework firing within 15 seconds.There were, however, no injuries.

              "17    While you might not think of sandy dunes and oceanic horizons when you picture Germany, the country that borders both the Baltic and North Seas and is perforated with lakes, boasts dozens of offshore and inland islands.They range from huge -- Rügen, in the brisk Baltic Sea, has 357 miles of coastline -- to super small, but many are beautiful, with cliffs, sheep, windmills, lighthouses, vast fields of tulips and rich histories.Sylt, a small, narrow island in the North Sea, and Rügen in the east played host to each side's elite when Germany was divided during the Cold War. Sylt was the base for the German navy during the world wars and eventually grew into a luxurious destination for its upper echelon; Rügen on the other hand was what Conde Nast Traveler called the \"Soviet version of the Hamptons.\"Today, you can travel to many of the islands in Germany's archipelago, or you can bask in their peacefulness in the photographic tour below.Sylt Island Phil via Getty Images David Peevers via Getty Images Usedom Island Meinzahn via Getty Images fhm via Getty Images Fred Froese via Getty Images Rügen Island RicoK69 via Getty Images Jorg Greuel via Getty Images Bernhard Lang via Getty Images Hiddensee Island Photo by Lars Oppermann via Getty Images www.galerie-ef.de via Getty Images FHR via Getty Images Föhr Island Ralf Wilken via Getty Images Ingeborg Knol via Getty Images Ingeborg Knol via Getty Images Borkum Island Oliver Hoffmann via Getty Images Karl Johaentges / LOOK-foto via Getty Images Konrad Wothe / LOOK-foto via Getty Images Amrum Island Raimund Linke via Getty Images F.

              "18    Theresa Schue by permissionWhen Theresa Schue snapped photos of the landscape on a church outing she wasn’t expecting to capture anything but the view. What she got has her so puzzled she has turned to the Internet to find answers. Schue published her photo of what appears to be the apparition of an elemental or nature spirit lurking in the woods in the Angels, Ghosts and Paranormal Facebook Group on Nov. 1.According to Theresa the picture was taken from the train in the Titusville, PA area as she was returning from a church trip in October. The image was captured with the camera on her cellphone. She is seeking an explanation for this mysterious image.Titusville is known for its haunted history as a result of ghastly mass graves, a bout with the plague and the gory deaths of both miners and prostitutes, says Schlue.While some viewers are skeptical and claim the image is simply a trick of the eye, known as matrixing or pareidolia, others are not so sure. Pareidolia or matrixing occurs when the brain attempts to make sense out of chaotic visual stimuli and interprets the image as something that makes sense. This often takes the form of seeing the human form, including facial features, where none exists. According to Grant Wilson, former lead investigator on “Ghost Hunters” one of the telltale signs of pareidolia or matixing is when the features of the apparition are made up of parts of the natural environment, such as leaves, twigs and branches. Another clue to pareidolia is when the features of the face are cartoony or out-of-proportion to the human face, says Wilson. Whether this applies to nature or elemental spirits is up for interpretation.Others think the image captured in Theresa Schue’s photo is that of an elemental spirit or some sort of forest spirit. They contend that nature and elemental spirits contain features that mimic the natural environment. Elemental spirits are believed to inhabit wooded areas. While some are protectors of the forest, others are negative spirits that roam the earth.Schue is unsure of what she has captured on film and seeks the advice of those with knowledge of the paranormal and/or photography in helping her identify the image. Although she makes no claims that she has captured evidence of the paranormal, she definitely sees the image of a human-like creature in her photo.She has received nearly 200 responses to her post. Responses range from those who claim not to see anything in the photo to those who believe she has captured the image of multiple spirits.When questioned about digitally altering the photo, Theresa explained,The picture was taken by my cell phone. I am 65 and do not know anything about touching stuff up. We were in a church group and another 63 yr old lady and I were looking at the pictures and this oddly stuck out oddly to us. It was taken on October 18 and we had shown it to a few church friends and we did not know what we saw. It was not explainable. My daughter decided today without my permission [to] send it to your group. I never wanted to send it out because I knew there would be doubters. But, now I am at least getting answers. Even if there may be those who doubt.Now that the photo has been published, Theresa says she would like help identifying the mysterious bigfoot-like creature that appears in the photo. So, now it’s your turn to help Theresa Schue figure out what this mysterious image really is. Is it a spirit, an illusion or something else?

              "19    Timing is everything in warfare, so here's a helpful tip for any up-and-coming global superpowers, evil masterminds or future corporate nation-states. The best year to stage your very own version of Red Dawn could be in 2028, when the U.S. Navy, the main protector of America's sovereignty, will be at its weakest.More specifically, the U.S. attack submarine fleet is expected to decline to a modern low. Today the Navy has 54 attack subs and four special guided-missile boats packing more than 150 cruise missiles each. But, as the blog War Is Boring explains:Swift, silent and heavily armed, the Navy's nuclear-powered attack subs are by far its, and America's, most powerful weapons for high-tech warfare. A single nuclear submarine can sink several attacking ships far from shore and also pummel ground targets with cruise missiles before slipping away at great depth. But the Pentagon took a long break from building subs during the 1990s and 2000s. Where once the Navy had bought four new undersea attack boats every year, for a while it acquired an average of just one annually. Congress finally took note and gave the sailing branch money to boost the build rate to a steady two boats a year starting in 2012. And that means there's going to be a big—but temporary—dip in submarine strength when the Los Angeles-class boats the Navy bought in the 1980s and mid-'90s finally age out. It'll take a few years for new Virginia-class vessels to replace them. The low point comes in 2028, when the Navy will have just 41 attack subs, 17 fewer than today. Since it takes around three submarines to guarantee that at least one is at sea and combat-ready at any given time that translates to roughly five fewer nuke boats poised to sink an invading fleet.What's more, it remains to be seen whether the Navy will be able to afford to build its new subs, especially as the expanding U.S. nuclear weapons budget threatens to cannibalize other Pentagon projects. According to the latest report from the Congressional Budget Office, \"the full annual cost of the 2015 shipbuilding plan would average $20.7 billion over the 2015-to-2044 period—32 percent more than the average annual funding the Navy has received in the past three decades.\"

They make a beeline for the McDonald’s. Fun game idea: go to an international airport and play “Count the Americans” (Flickr/Douglas Whitfield)It’s a typically American trait to go through the time and expense of traveling to exotic foreign lands, only to make a run for the Golden Arches the second we clear customs. I’m guilty of this sometimes, too, but only because the first thing I want to do is see if they really call the Quarter Pounder a “Royale With Cheese.”2. They’re in sweatpants.If this American weren’t wearing sweatpants, he wouldn’t be able to sleep like this. But that would be a good thing. (Photo: Getty Images)It’s as if Americans feel that if pilots and flight attendants wear uniforms when they fly, we should, too. And that uniform often takes the form of sweatpants. You don’t see sweatpants with “JUICY” stenciled across the butt too often anymore. But if you’re traveling overseas wearing these, you might as well have “AMERICAN” stitched on your behind.3. They’re wearing baseball caps.(Photo: Thinkstock) Another component of the American Flying Uniform. 4. They make fun of where they are…\"…and then I asked the baggage guy if he speaks English. And he said, ‘No!’\" (Photo: Thinkstock) \"This place is a dump\" or \"What a backwards country\" or \"We don’t/do have this back home\" or other kind of comment, wisecrack, or joke about the country you’re in is a stereotypical ugly-American stereotype that most U.S. world travelers try very hard to dispel. Don’t make our jobs harder.5. …that is, if they even know where they are.Check out what Twitter user ‏@qirtaiba posted:This is HONESTLY A REAL CONVERSATION going on next to me between Americans right now at Heathrow Airport. A: This is my first time in Europe.| B: England isn't part of Europe. They didn't want to be. A: Then what are the main countries in Europe? Germany and Portugal? B: No, it's Germany and... Britain. A: But isn't this Britain? B: No, this is the United Kingdom. A: So where is Britain on the map? It must be right next to the United Kingdom? B: Yep.6. They try to cut into the security line.Cutting the security line because you’re running late is not appropriate in any country. (Photo: Corbis Images)Trying to jump ahead in lines at security will get you labeled as the worst kind of me-first, always-on-the-go American. 7. They strip in the security line.Different countries have different airport security procedures so check before you strip. (Photo: Corbis Images)Not every country requires the virtual strip searches we endure in TSA lines in the States. But years of conditioning have us reaching for our coats, belts, and shoes the second we see a security agent standing in front of any sort of scanner, no matter if it’s required or not. No wonder the entire world thinks we Americans are a bunch of exhibitionists.8. They call it a “security line.”But “security queue” just doesn’t have that same ring to it.9. They think that asking for things loudly is more effective…She is not impressed by the volume of your voice (Photo: Getty Images)…as if yelling, “WHICH WAY TO BAGGAGE CLAIM?!?” serves as a universal translator.10. They’re drunk.Try not to get sloppy drunk before your flight; our national reputation depends on it. (Photo: Getty Images)\"Americans just can’t hold their liquor\" is a stereotype that we Americans continue to endure, despite our best efforts (not that we should stop trying).Let Yahoo Travel inspire you every day.

              "26    When people use the words “barn find” to describe a car they’ve found, it usually means two things: (a) it’s a sought-after auto in non-running yet admirable condition, or (b) it’s a car that should’ve been crushed by said barn.This for-sale listing is clearly the latter of those two and it begs the question, “Is this the worst car that’s ever been posted to eBay?” Voice your opinion below.RELATED: Check out this gorgeous 1938 Bugatti Type 57C Barn FindThe barn find listing hails from Gateshead, located in the United Kingdom, and includes snapshots of one seriously unsavory Mercedes. Here’s how the seller puts it:“freshly found this morning a mercedes benz not sure which model we have proof of ownership, car has never moved for 20 years currently covered in pigeon gauno. sold as non running project but was aparently working when parked up.”RELATED: The 2014 Mercedes Vision GT hints at the company’s future sports carsFreshly found indeed. Going off the photos, we can deduce that this was a Mercedes-Benz 200 (W123) before it became a pile of pigeon poo. Though now we’re not sure if even the most diehard of MB aficionados would touch this with at 10-foot pole.The interior surprisingly doesn’t look that bad however, barring of course the shards of glass and drips of feces. Everything looks to be all there. The broken rear window might be a bit drafty though. Up front, there’s a good two inches of bird dirt covering the wiper cowl. But who isn’t up for a little fixer-upper?PHOTOS: The all-new 2015 Mercedes S-Class is drop dead gorgeousUnbelievably, 18 people bid on this pile of pigeon doo and it ended up selling for £264, (around $340). Sure, there’s some scrap value to this barn find and perhaps even a few parts worth picking, but is the mountain of excrement worth wading through to get it?That would be a “No.” Run away. Run far, far away from these poo-spewing foul fowls.RELATED: Gaze in awe at the shockingly beautiful 1954 Mercedes 300 SL Gullwing__________________________________________________For More, Follow

              "28    ShutterstockSkip the mall this holiday season — that is, if you want to give your children and grandchildren a gift they’ll appreciate for decades to come.A survey released Wednesday by Upromise found that more than seven in 10 parents would prefer their children receive money towards college as a holiday gift, rather than a physical gift. And if grandparents and others do give the child money towards college, they’d better ask mom and dad how to send that money. While most parents want cash or a check, others want the money by other means, according to the survey of more than 500 parents ages 25 to 64.Five ways to give the grandkids money for collegePercentage of parents who say this is their preferred method of receiving college funds for their kids.Cash/check 28.30% Deposit into a 529 plan 25.90% General savings account 22.70% Savings bond 16.80% Exchange-traded fund 6.20% Source: Sallie Mae’s Upromise.Parents’ preference for college cash — rather than the physical gifts — makes a lot of sense, considering the now-astronomical cost of college. Indeed, the cost of college is rising rapidly -- Mark Kantrowitz, the senior vice president and publisher of Edvisors.com, says that parents of newborns should assume that the average cost of college over any 17-year period will go up by a factor of three from its current cost) — which means it may cost a child attending a four-year in-state college in 2031 (17 years from now) more than $220,000 for all four years.“The cost of college is continually rising and parents are very aware of this, but it’s hard for families [to save for college] as they also save for retirement and go through daily life,” says Erin Condon, the vice president of Upromise.Of course, students can get loans and scholarships, but this may be hard to count on as a way to fully fund education. From 2008 to 2012, the total debt at graduation increased an average of 6% each year, and more than seven in 10 college seniors who graduate have student loan debt, with an average debt of nearly $30,000 per borrower as of 2012, according to The Project on Student Debt.'Frozen' holiday battle: Anna vs. Elsa?Toy makers and retailers are betting on Disney's \"Frozen\" for a huge holiday season. But is it really a battle between Elsa and Anna?Also see: Parents, stop paying off your kids’ student loansThat’s one reason giving cash for college is so important — and can potentially make a meaningful impact down the road. Consider: If you give a child just $150 each holiday season towards college and do this from infancy through age 18, the child could have more than $4,000 towards college — and that’s assuming a modest 4% annual return on investment. Throw in a college donation at each birthday, and you could see that total double, though, of course, you’d have to invest the money somewhere (a 529 plan is a good option), as savings accounts these days don’t have high yields.On the flip side, let’s say the child has to borrow that $8,000 to pay for college. Considering that, as a rough rule of thumb, for every $1 a child borrows, she pays back $2, that $8,000 she had to borrow could cost her $16,000. So, give her $150 a year from the time she is an infant and she can spend that $8,000 on school and not have to repay it — or she may end up forking over $16,000 down the road.Of course, young kids probably don’t care much about a college donation and instead want to rip open a brand-new toy. That’s why some grandparents may want to buy one, less pricey physical gift and put the remaining money towards school (assuming, of course, that the family will likely need your financial help in paying for college and/or doesn’t need your money for a more pressing issue like a child’s medical costs). And don’t feel too guilty about not stuffing boxes under the Christmas tree: 60% of parents already think their kids are more spoiled than they were as children.Or — possibly better yet — resist the urge to buy physical gifts at all, remembering that, down the road, the child will probably thank you, as student-loan burdened graduates clearly aren’t pleased about the impact the debt has had on their lives. A survey released in October by Citizens Financial Group found that 47% of people who had attended college said they would have considered not going at all had they known the impact student loans would have on their lives, and more than half said that based on what they know today, they would not have financed their education with student loans.

              "29    Jamie Dornan is back in Vancouver for some Fifty Shades of Grey reshoots and yes, he is looking dapper. Don't worry, this is not necessarily a harbinger of bad movie-themed doom; reshoots are very common as the post-production editing process comes together. (Picture the film's producers in the editing room, thinking deep cinematic thoughts like, Do we need more footage of whips and chains?) Here he is suited and booted as Christian Grey; it's unclear if he has to do anything other than stand on these steps and be beautiful but then why would he, really? I could/would watch for 90+ minutes in a cinema happily; just keep the popcorn coming.OK, I kid, I kid, Jamie Dornan's good looks are no laughing matter.Dakota Johnson is also back for more filming, though so far — at least in paparazzi photos — she's stuck wearing more sad cardigans and carrying a big umbrella.Follow Alex on Twitter.

              "30    Countdown to Mockingjay! The first official photocall for The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 has gone down, and naturally, all of your favorite gals—including Jennifer Lawrence—turned it out for the photo op in London on Sunday, Nov. 9.PHOTOS: Jen's best red carpet momentsGames' leading lady, Lawrence, 24, worked a black top tucked into a winter white suit by Public School to meet up with her castmates. The witty blonde added silver heels to the ensemble. Lawrence also styled her bob—chopped after dying her hair too many times to play brunette Katniss so that it could heal—into loose waves, completing her power look.PHOTOS: She said what?! Jen's most hilarious quotesView gallery The gang's all here! Julianne Moore, Liam Hemsworth, Jennifer Lawrence, Donald Sutherland, Eliza …But she wasn't the only one ready for her close-up! Lawrence's female costars, including Elizabeth Banks, Julianne Moore, and Natalie Dormer joined her at the Corinthia Hotel, each one clearly receiving the memo to model cool prints and fierce heels. (See Dormer's Hunger Games transformation here!)PHOTOS: Meet the cast of The Hunger GamesAnd then, the whole gang came on out. Mockingjay's gentlemen—Liam Hemsworth, Donald Sutherland, Sam Claflin, and Stanley Tucci—snuck in for some extra shots to kick off the international press tour for the much-anticipated film, in theaters Nov. 21. (However, Josh Hutcherson, Lawrence's second love interest in the film, was notably absent.)PHOTOS: Jennifer's early modeling photosTwo of the cast, however, got an early start on racking up their sky miles: Lawrence and Hemsworth, 24, visited Wetten, das…?, an Austrian TV show, on Nov. 8, to promote the film and decorate matching chocolate cakes in celebration. While the Aussie actor put a smiley face on his cake (\"very creative,\" noted Lawrence), the Kentucky-bred Oscar winner iced a horse head onto her cake, joking that she should \"probably eat [the icing]; it'll help with the creative process.\"View gallery Liam Hemsworth and Jennifer Lawrence visit Austrian TV show Wetten, das…? to promote Mockingjay on N …Obviously close with one another, Hemsworth previously stated that it was Lawrence who helped him during his split from Miley Cyrus in 2013. \"Being around someone like Jen, who is so honest and laughs all day long, I am forced to be in the right now. I'm much happier,\" the Last Song actor said to the AP.

              "34    A British sasquatch enthusiast claims to have captured the sights and sounds of the legendary and elusive ape man. See if it convinces you that Bigfoot is more than a myth.Has he gone expat? Roger Patterson and Robert GimlinPerhaps the reason Bigfoot keeps itself so hidden is that it's embarrassed by its lackluster singing voice. That's one potential takeaway from the fuzzy video below that Sasquatch fanatic Adam Bird says he captured back in June and just posted to YouTube on Tuesday.Bird told the UK Mirror that he went in search of Bigfoot in a patch of woodland after hearing stories of Sasquatch sightings in the area.\"We stayed there for a few hours that day and felt watched and followed the whole time,\" Bird told the paper.He claims that he took some photos and the video below. He says he didn't notice a shadowy figure staring at his group from behind the trees until reviewing the photos later. However, in the video below, it seems clear that he and his colleague are a little freaked by loud, moaning vocalizations that can be heard. They sound like a cross between an elk bugle and the frustrated lament I made into the New Mexico sky one night years ago after watching the finale of Lost.Bird is something of an authority on Bigfoot in the UK. He says he first encountered evidence of the beast on a visit to Florida years ago and has been obsessed ever since. He co-founded a Bigfoot research organization in the UK and has reportedly worked with the Animal Planet show \"Finding Bigfoot\" for an upcoming episode.Sightings and interest in Bigfoot seem to have enjoyed a bit of an uptick recently, even with apparent hoaxes not holding up to DNA analysis earlier this year and the planned \"tour\" of a Bigfoot corpse also turning out to be a fraud.What do you think of the latest Bigfoot news? Is there evidence of Bigfoot in the video? And what is Sasquatch doing in Britain anyway? Did he find a great deal on airfare to get away from the gun-toting crew that's hunting him on the Gulf Coast?

              "35    Back in October, a company called Arx Pax launched a Kickstarter to finance development of a new magnetic technology that, among other things, would make possible a semi-functioning version of the hover-boards featured in Back to the Future Part II. Though their invention will only work on certain surfaces, it’s a promising development, especially for fans of the sci-fi time-travel flick who have been patiently waiting for director Robert Zemeckis’ version of the future to arrive.Back to the Future Part II sends Marty McFly from 1985 to 2015, where everything is automated and super-convenient. Though many have voiced (joking) displeasure that we still don’t have hover-boards, watching the movie today, it’s actually impressive just how many predictions Zemeckis and his team got right on the eve of 2015. Let’s review, shall we?Mr. Fusion Home Energy ReactorInstead of using dangerous and illegal plutonium to power up his flux reactor, the 2015 version of Dr. Brown simply tosses a few banana peels and some beer into what looks like a Vitamix — and away they fly. Though we’re not exactly dumping our trash into our cars at the moment, scientists are closing in on making a more complex version of that.Cellulosic ethanol made from organic garbage  is a promising biofuel now being developed for mass usage. A company called Fiberight is at the forefront of the technology, turning “rotten vegetables, paper, cardboard, and any other plant-based matter into a steaming mass of grey pulp,” which then becomes fuel.So, while we’re not quite at the point where we can make that conversion with our cars, you have to give points to the BTTF team for being on the right track.Flying carsWell, this one hasn’t quite happened yet… maybe because our auto companies are mostly just focused on their survival.Sleep-inducing alpha-rhythm generatorDoc puts Jennifer to sleep with this scary little invention, which helps wipe out memories, as well. In real life, we can put people to sleep almost instantly, but that generally requires either drugs or hitting the right pressure point, both of which are way less gentle than Doc’s small device.Self-lacing sneakersEarlier this year, Nike announced that it was actually going to manufacture self-lacing high tops, after they started selling the Air Mag design that Marty slips on as he’s trying to blend in with the future. Great news for everyone that hates bending over for more than three seconds at a time!Self-adjusting and drying jacketClothes were supposed to be way more convenient in 2015 all the way around, but companies just haven’t gotten around to manufacturing jackets that automatically adjust to your size (probably because doing so would cannibalize their business). We don’t have jackets that blow dry themselves, either, but there’s plenty of new water-resistant fabrics, so at least that’s something.Holographic moviesTrue, 3D movies had been around a long time even when Back to the Future Part II hit theaters, but they certainly didn’t resemble the sort of technology we have today. Though we don’t have the sort of tech that creates the illusion of massive sharks attacking us in the street, slipping on 3D glasses can certainly give that illusion. So, half a point!Soundboard vestOne of Griff’s thugs plays a chicken noise on his vest to mock Marty, though having a bulky vest that generates sounds is far dopier than anything McFly was wearing. This wouldn’t be very hard to make these days, given our microscopic digital technology, but hopefully no one decides to actually construct it.Hands-free video gamesMarty shows off his shooting skills to two youngsters (including a tiny Elijah Wood!) at the 80’s Cafe, but they’re none too impressed. “You mean you have to use your hands?” they mock. “That’s like a baby’s toy!”Though kids these days are still jamming their thumbs and swiping fingers, there are hands-free video games, including the motion sensor utilized in Microsoft’s Xbox Kinect. The Cubs winning the World SeriesThe victory by the perennially pathetic team is unexpected even in this version of 2015. The Cubbies still haven’t won a World Series in our reality, and unless they undergo a major roster overhaul, they’ll probably fall short next year, too.A Miami baseball teamMarty is less astounded by the Cubs’ win, however, than he is by the fact that it came over a baseball team from Miami. As it would turn out, the city got a team — the Marlins — just a few years after the film was released. But they would never face off in the World Series, because they’re both in the National League.A remote-controlled camera on a wireThe camera used by USA Today (seemingly the only news outlet in the movie’s 2015) to cover the crash at City Hall zips above, threaded to a wire strung across the plaza. It is quite reminiscent of the SkyCam, which was invented in 2009 and is now used in many televised sporting events to provide angles impossible by any human-operated camera.Fingerprint paymentMaybe Apple engineers have been watching Back to the Future for inspiration, because the thumbprint payment system is pretty similar to (if a bit more advanced than) Apple Pay, which will allow you to pay for items using your phone and fingerprint ID.Food hydratorA tiny Pizza Hut pizza is slipped into the Black & Decker Food Hydrator and, a few seconds later, comes out as a full-size, very delicious-looking pie (the Pizza Hut company actually sent a chef to set to make sure the food looked palatable). We have very convenient dehydrators, but so far, no good way to hydrate food, a fact for which Seamless must be very grateful.Scenery TVIf you’re so inclined to watch hours of the same, boring scenery, it is very much available on DVD or YouTube. It’s also a hit program in Norway.Video conferencingSkype, FaceChat and every incredibly complex office conferencing system pretty much nailed this one. Thankfully, people can’t just turn on the screen and catch you unawares — unless they’re hackers.Multi-screen TVCable was just at its ascent back in 1989, when Back to the Future Part II was released, which must have inspired this big screen with lots of different channels playing at once. Picture-in-picture has been standard on TVs for years, and as any subscriber to NFL Sunday Ticket will tell you, it’s possible to fill a screen with an endless array of different programs. This is where ADD was born. Video glassesMarty Jr. and his sister — also played by Michael J. Fox — spend their time at the dinner table behind a pair of digital glasses, watching TV and answering the phone through their clunky shades. Now, early adapters and weirdos have access to Google Glass, which more or less allows people to do all the same things as those TV glasses, without the sweet style.Rejuvenation clinicDoc rips off his “mask” early in the film, to reveal the results of his trip to a rejuvenation clinic, which replaced his spleen and colon, fixed his wrinkles, and added a few decades to his life. In reality, we’re not there yet, though plenty of shady “pharmaceutical” companies and “life-extension” clinics promise similar results.Upside down floating “chair”Another sweet development for the elderly was this upside-down floating device used by old George McFly (whose face is inexplicably white, despite the fact that all the blood should have rushed to his head). Sadly, this looks a long ways away for us.

              "43    Hillary Clinton can't keep her story straight. I'm not talking about her email servers. She can't stick to a consistent line on the rather more central issue of the U.S. economy. It is leading to odd tonal shifts in her campaign, and to some foolish policy choices, too.It's not entirely her fault. The last two Democratic presidents had comparatively simple tasks when designing their economic messages. Bill Clinton could run against 12 years of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, especially since the country still thought it was in a recession when he ran. Barack Obama could say the economy was in crisis mostly because of George W. Bush and secondarily because of decades of conservative policies.Hillary Clinton has a harder task. She can't simply celebrate today's economy as the product of Democratic policies, because people aren't thrilled with it. She can't blame the economy's inadequacy on a Republican administration, because there hasn't been one for six and a half years. She can't say that the economy is subpar because of decades of bad policy choices, either: That period includes 16 years of Democratic presidencies, including her husband's, and she wants to associate herself with the prosperity of Bill's time in office.Her solution has been to do all of these things at once. Terrible trends started around 1981 and the Democrats have made things better when they've been in charge and we have a good economy again and we need to change everything we've been doing for a long time. She sounded each of these notes in recent speeches at the New School and New York University.The most consistent story she could tell would be that everything went wrong with Reagan. A lot of liberal thinkers have invested their intellectual labor in this story. Her argument would be that Reagan unraveled the postwar bargain between government, labor and business — weakening the first two forces and strengthening the third — and that the result has been stagnation or worse for most American workers.This explanation seems to dominate the Clinton campaign's economic thinking. It informs her latest proposal, which is to hike capital gains taxes except for very long-term investments. It lies beneath her complaints about the weakness of labor unions, too.But the story doesn't really fit the facts. The booms of the 1980s and 1990s benefited most Americans, with compensation rising and most people saying they were satisfied with how things were going. The decline of unions was not mostly the result of Reaganite hostility: It's a trend that was already under way when John F. Kennedy was president, and seems to have had a lot to do with the inability of unionized companies to compete with nonunionized ones.Perhaps worse from a political perspective, that story also makes Bill Clinton appear to have been ineffectual in protecting American workers from conservatism — or, worse, to have collaborated with it. Viewing the Reagan-Bush and Clinton policies today, there seems to be more continuity than difference. Trade grew freer, unions declined and inequality grew under all three of them (and beyond their presidencies). Bill Clinton even cut the capital-gains tax that Hillary Clinton now seeks to raise.Reconciling all these conflicting economic messages would tax even the most skillful of politicians. The Democrats are lucky that Hillary Clinton is such a natural.Ramesh Ponnuru is a Bloomberg View columnist.

              "44     View Enlarged ImageAs of Thursday morning, Jennifer Palmieri was employed as communications director for the Hillary Clinton campaign. Whether she still has that job on Friday morning after indicting her boss' qualifications to be president remains to be seen.On Wednesday, Palmieri appeared on Bloomberg Television's \"With All Due Respect,\" where she told co-host John Heilemann that Clinton \"didn't really think it through \" when she decided to use her personal email account for State Department business.Yes, just what America needs — a president and commander in chief who has a history of not really thinking through important decisions that can have an impact on national security.Of all the things we've heard and learned this week about the Clinton email scandal, Palmieri's statement is the most revealing. When a trusted aide admits her boss, who craves the presidency and all its power, has used poor judgment in a critical situation, the public should take note. This isn't a Republican saying this, or a Democratic challenger. It's from someone who, presumably, is in close association with Clinton every day and has been for some time. It's from someone who's observed the former secretary of state operate in public and private and has inside information that few have.Palmieri, a veteran of both the Clinton and Obama White Houses, of course did not mean for her statement to be an indictment of Clinton. She was merely doing what communications directors do when their bosses get in trouble — try to make it seem as if the trouble isn't really so bad.Often spokesmen will invent \"facts\" and dream up the overwhelming circumstances that led a politician into a tight spot. But whether she intended to condemn her boss or not, Palmieri is nevertheless right: Clearly Clinton \"didn't really think it through.\"Clinton has enough trouble without her allies giving her more. Each day brings a new set of problems related to her personal email account and private server. Just in the last day we've learned that the investigation into her personal email account is likely to widen and will probably grow beyond merely emails and into what type of device she used for State Department business. It appears that she used personal devices rather than State Department-issued devices that are more secure.Didn't think it through. Poor judgment. What difference does it make?Quite a lot, if the person who isn't thinking clearly and can't make good decisions is president of the United States. We don't believe the country needs someone who doesn't really think it through when she gets that 3 a.m. phone call.

              "45    Photo Credit: iStockA few months ago, I made the big decision to stop taking my birth control pills after almost 10 full years. It wasn’t because I stopped having sex or because I decided I wanted to try getting pregnant, or even because I wanted to try something different. It was because my birth control pills almost ruined my relationship, and they messed me up so much that I still can’t imagine ever taking them again.If you’re skeptical of how birth control pills can almost ruin a relationship, then I kind of envy you, because you’ve obviously never experienced what I did. My birth control pills toyed with my emotions so badly that they made me feel like a different person. For over a year, I barely felt like myself.There were times when I was “normal,” but there were more times when I was outrageously angry over nothing, so depressed I considered taking drastic measures, and so frustratingly anxious that it made me act completely out of character. I had no control over my emotions, and it was a horrible feeling—and something that almost drove my boyfriend away for good.My birth control pills weren’t always my worst enemies in tiny pill form. I went on the Pill at 16-years-old, when I was in a serious relationship with my first boyfriend, and my mom insisted I go on them “just in case” (in retrospect, thanks Mom—that was a pretty awesome move).Related: 30 Things Smart Women Know By The Time They’re 30It cleared up almost all of my stubborn acne, it helped me have a regular menstrual cycle for the first time, well, ever, and it eased the incredibly painful cramps I had once gotten every single month without fail. Cramps that had once kept me in bed crying in pain were gone, I wasn’t worried about getting pregnant, and my boobs got a little bigger (OK, this may have been a coincidence). I loved the birth control pill.I stayed on that same pill through college, when out of nowhere, my health insurance dropped the coverage of that brand. After a failed attempt with the generic brand, I went on a short break from the Pill for a few months.When I met my current boyfriend, I tried to go back on my old, trusty pill, but even my new health insurance didn’t cover it. My gynecologist suggested a similar option, so I tried it, figuring I had nothing to lose.At first, this pill worked fine. It wasn’t the same as my first pill, but it wasn’t terrible either. Then, out of nowhere, things became a little different. I couldn’t tell you exactly when it started, but at some point, I realized a horrible attitude every time I was PMSing replaced my crippling cramps. I felt irrationally angry over almost nothing at all—someone could speak to me in the wrong tone of voice, and I would feel the urge to punch them in the face wash over me.As a normally calm person, this violent reaction made me feel uneasy. I took my anger out on the people closest to me, like my family members and my boyfriend. I picked fights with him over nothing, just to enjoy the feeling of yelling at someone.It wasn’t just the uncontrollable anger. I was sad, really, really sad, and not only when I was PMSing. At random times, I felt heavy waves of depression fall over me. I would cry myself to sleep over a comment taken the wrong way, or my friends would be too busy to hang out, and I would feel devastatingly lonely.Sometimes I felt so miserable that I wondered what it would be like if I just wasn’t around. I had a good job, a great boyfriend, an amazing family, friends who cared about me, and everything else I could have wanted—there was no reason for depression.On top of the anger and depression, I felt anxious about everything. I mostly took this anxiety out on my boyfriend in the form of jealousy. I became wildly jealous over everything he did without me. Despite the fact that he had never gone behind my back to hurt me, or given me a reason to distrust him, I was suspicious of his every move.I looked at his text messages when he wasn’t in the room, I questioned him repeatedly, and I called him over and over again when he wouldn’t answer. I knew I was being irrational, difficult, and controlling, but at the same time, I felt like I couldn’t stop. Sometimes I would do things, and later when I was feeling more myself, I would look back on them as if watching a movie of someone else doing them. It was a horrible feeling.As I’m sure you can imagine, my relationship was suffering. My boyfriend couldn’t understand why I didn’t trust him, why nothing he said made me feel like I could count on him—and honestly, I couldn’t understand it either.He hated the questioning, he didn’t know how to deal with the mood swings (which went from furious to crying to laughing to furious again), and he felt like I was a different person. He wasn’t the only one who felt that way.Related: 11 Signs The Girl You Love Is A KeeperAfter a few months of this, I finally started to wonder if maybe it was my birth control. The thought had never occurred to me before, because no one had ever warned me of emotional side effects like these.I had heard that the Pill could maybe make you gain weight, cause a blood clot, or make you bloated, but I had never heard that it could make you feel like a stranger in your own body. I doubted myself, but at the same time, I considered switching pills.Things got worse in my relationship. My boyfriend and I were mad at each other all the time. I refused to give him the space he needed, and he pulled away from me. I told him I thought it might be the pill, and one day, he finally gave me an ultimatum: try a different pill, or we’d break up.This was the best relationship I had ever been in, a relationship I could see lasting for a very long time. I realized then that my emotions were ruining all of the good things we had once had together, and I wanted those good things back.I did switch pills, and after a few weeks, I felt like my normal self again. I didn’t feel violently angry towards people I barely interacted with. I stopped picking fights with my boyfriend, and my trust in him returned—I no longer felt worried about everything he did. Things with us improved almost immediately.In the end, the pills I switched to helped me emotionally, but had some annoying physical side effects. When my gynecologist told me she worried about blood clots, she also basically told me I had to switch pills again. I tried one more time, but after a few months, I felt myself getting out of control again, and I thought, that’s it—I’m done.I’ve been off birth control pills for a few months now, and I really feel like it was the best decision I ever could have made. I still get sad or frustrated when I’m PMSing, but I don’t feel out of control, and I don’t feel completely and totally irrational.My terrible cramps have returned, my cycle is irregular again, and I of course have to worry about an unwanted pregnancy, but you know what? It’s worth it.I don’t feel like a stranger, my boyfriend and I are very happy, and I have control over my feelings again. I wouldn’t trade that for birth control pills no matter how hard a gynecologist would try to convince me.More from YourTango: My Wife’s Depression Almost Ended Our Marriage 7 Incredible Ways Love

              "48    If US Honda was a bakery, it'd be like this: The shelves are full of bread, all pretty good and readily available, but nothing special. But sometimes you'd see an amazing cupcake on the shelf, incredibly detailed and looking like nothing you've ever seen. When you ask to buy it, the guy behind the counter smiles and crushes it in his fist.That's Honda in America. Sure, there's nothing exactly wrong with the cars they sell here, but almost all of them — perhaps with the exception of the new Fit — are anonymous, committee-designed competency-boxes that my dentist shows me pictures of to put me under before extracting a handful of bicuspids.But then I see things like Honda's newly announced N-Box Slash (or N/). It's the latest version of their little N-Box Kei car line, and it's pretty much exactly what I want from a modern car. It's fantastic on space utilization, it doesn't look like every other thing on the road, it seems flexible and practical, the design — interior and exterior — manages to have a sense of fun without being ridiculous, and it seems like a comfortable, efficient and practical way to go about that 80% of driving that is utilitarian without being bored to tears.I love this thing. Just look at these design options you get for the interior theme of the car: Tennessee Session (lots of wood, dark leather), California Diner (red leather, checkerboard), Hawaii Glide (yellow exterior, pale blue interior with stripes), Street Rod, Bright Rod — these variants in color, materials, and trim go a long way to giving the same car a range of characters, and they all seem far too much fun for American Honda to even consider offering.The exterior is a classic Kei-car one-box design, but with a sort of chop-top/short greenhouse look to make it a look a little less like something from a Richard Scarry book. The side window line —specifically that upward kick of the rear side windows — seems to be a little bit of a shout-out to the old Honda Z600.Most US-based automotive sites are saying it's a 'retro' look, which I disagree with, but this is a very telling description. The design is quite modern, really, certainly more so than its brother, the N-One, which has a front end definitely inspired by the old Honda N600 of the '60s and early '70s. The N-Box Slash isn't like that — it's not trying to mimic designs of the past, but it does share one key thing with past designs that Honda (along with most carmakers) have lost — a sense of fun.I think it's being called 'retro' because it's not trying to be another cookie-cutter aspirational design. I think we haven't seen this in modern cars for so long (outside of actual retro designs like the Fiat 500, Mini, or Beetle) that we just assume the idea is from the past. It doesn't have to be.The Honda N-Box Slash is Kei car compliant, which means it's quite small, and has an engine that's 600cc/64 HP max. Sure, that's probably not going to fly in the US, but I'd still love to see a slightly uprated version of a car like this make it to our shores. Maybe it'd have to be scaled up.Though, if Honda could figure out a way to get, say, a 1.5L engine in there and meet US crash regs, it could help free Honda from the \"Galapagos\" trap of their current Kei cars. See, all Kei cars are basically like Galapagos turtles, in that they can only exist in Japan, like those giant tortoises only exist on the Galapagos islands. Maybe there could be a wider market for clever, space-efficient cars outside of the Home Islands?Of course, I'm probably just dreaming. The N-Box Slash probably wouldn't sell that much over here. But I still can't shake my desire for a small, fun, useful car like this, something with acres more character than a Yaris or a Mirage, and even more usable than a Fiat 500.I guess I'll have to hold on to that old 1st-gen xB a little longer, and hope someone at Honda decides to take a risk.

              "50    Why do relationships deteriorate over time? What causes people to disconnect and drift apart? I'm not just talking about intimate relationships between married couples and partners; I'm talking about all relationships. What is causing this epidemic of disconnection? Why can't we maintain a deep connection with the people in our lives?I'll tell you why. It's because we are all lying, hiding and keeping secrets from everyone in our lives, thinking it's what we're meant to do. We use the excuse that if we tell people what we really think, we may hurt their feelings or get into trouble. So instead, we don't express ourselves, we keep our real thoughts secret and ultimately hide our true selves from the people we care about most. In other words, no one is being authentic in relationships.Now, don't be offended that I just called you a liar and a secret keeper. The good news is you're not alone. Look at the people around you. They have just as many secrets as you do. Maybe even more. Yes, everyone has secrets and many people don't think keeping a secret is a big deal, but it is a big deal. Here's why.1) Secrets create reality. Most people believe that if you hide something, then it doesn't really exist. It's just a hidden secret or thought in your mind. It's not real, it has no impact, and it means nothing. That's a lie. The act of making a secret and hiding it is what makes it real. If you have to hide information, it gives it a level of importance and property. It actually does the opposite of what you want it to do. Instead of the secret disappearing because you're not telling, it becomes very real, affecting your relationships, happiness and keeping you stuck in a \"purgatory\" that you don't even know you're in.2) Secrets hide the real you. What makes up a secret? It's something you can't tell. It's something you aren't allowed to talk about. It's something that will get you in trouble. It's something that you are ashamed or embarrassed about. There are big secrets and little secrets. Many people can grasp how keeping a big secret, like cheating on a spouse, is significant and would impact a person. What about the little secrets? Are they significant? Every secret is significant.For example, I had a client, we'll call him Peter, who was seriously dating a woman. During their first year together, she put on about 20 pounds. She would ask him all the time how she looked and said she wanted him to tell the truth. He didn't want to tell her how he really felt which was that she had gotten heavy. Instead, he lied and told her she looked great. The more she would ask, the more he would lie and not tell her what he really thought. Slowly, he started to become less attracted to her. Then he felt guilty for being \"so shallow\" about her weight. And then he became aware of how much he picked on her in his head about her weight and started obsessing about it. His secret started to really take shape and become real. It even got to a point where he was no longer physically aroused by her. Peter thought he was having erectile issues, but they were really secret issues.3) Secrets manifest problems elsewhere. Somewhere along the way it became okay for people to be secret keepers. The problem is, we don't realize the big impact secrets have on our relationships or ourselves. You cannot be deeply connected with someone if you're withholding your true thoughts and feelings. In the example above, Peter's relationship deteriorated because he was afraid to tell the truth to his girlfriend. Plus his secret impacted him emotionally and physically. It wasn't until he looked at what he was hiding from his girlfriend that he was able to connect his secret to his erectile dysfunction. 4) Secrets wreck relationships. People don't realize that their secrets are why their marriage ended or the reason they don't get along with their boss. Often, when a relationship falls apart, a person will just explain what happens, saying they've \"fallen out of love\" with the other person or \"it just didn't work out.\" They almost never ask the question: what was I hiding? What secrets was I keeping? People rarely own up that they were the source of the disconnection. Instead they hunt for their own innocence and play the victim, pointing the finger at what the other person did wrong.5) Secrets isolate you from the most important people in your life. I have never met a person who feels totally free to tell anyone anything or express what they really think. Most people live in their own little private, secret world where they spend most of their time managing what they are saying. It's pretty lonely in there. When I coach a person, one of the first things I do is have them get all their secrets out of their head and onto paper. Why? Because their secrets are what keeps them separate from the people in their lives and they don't even know it. Keeping secrets makes you think you know how things are, and if you already know, you don't investigate with the other living, breathing humans around you. This robs you of real communication and intimacy.When you don't say what you really think, people can't know who you really are. Therefore, you'll never feel loved for who you really are. So, how do you stop the secret keeping that is killing your relationships and covering up the real you? Very carefully. Don't just go blurting your nasty thoughts to people. Seek help in how to begin communicating honestly. There is a formula to having this go well and you're going to require practice. If you want your relationships to survive, even thrive, this is one of the most important skills to develop.

              "56    NeNe Leakes new show Fab Gab made its debut this week, giving fans another way to keep up with the Real Housewives of Atlanta star. The first episode featured The View co-host Whoopi Goldberg, and her rather impressive shoe collection — one that impressed the very well-heeled NeNe.“I am a shoe person, but I have met my damn match, honey.”Fab Gab will be airing weekly on Leakes’ website, NeNe Leaks Official. WetPaint states that the five-minute show “isn’t exactly inspired webisode content” — but for NeNe’s fans, it’s entertaining to watch her chat it up with other celebs.“I met up with Whoopi Goldberg in her shoe closet to talk everything from her obsession with fabulous shoes… She also gifted me with the most fabulous shoes, hunni! And here I was thinking I was killing the shoe game… well I’ve met my match!”Whoopi talks about her footwear obsession with NeNe and reveals that she loves “unusual shoes” — if you like shoes, it’s worth taking a peek at Whoopi’s dressing room at The View. Her wall-to-wall shoe collection rivals any of the Real Housewives‘ closets, leaving fans to wonder what her shoe closet looks like at home.When asked if designers give her the shoes in her collection, Whoopi stated that she buys all her own shoes, and there were some that she hadn’t even worn yet, including an amazing pair of Christian Louboutins.NeNe went right from shoes to asking Whoopie if she enjoys cocktails after work — a strange transition, but hey, it’s NeNe’s show and it’s only five minutes, so it’s not surprising that she crammed in two completely different topics on the debut of her online show.“When you’re not working at The View what do you do? Do you have a cocktail?” Leakes asked Goldberg. The answer was a resounding “no” with Whoopi telling NeNe that she “used to” drink but doesn’t anymore because she “likes her life” and doesn’t want to do that anymore.From shoes to cocktails, NeNe Leakes‘ mini-talk show will be airing weekly online. There’s no word on who the next guest on FabGab will be, but fans can expect it to be a fast and entertaining spot, perfect to view on a lunch break or when you need a fix from the reality star who truly has the gift of gab.[Image: NeNe Leakes Official]

              "57    Early Friday evening Sen. Elizabeth Warren took to the Senate floor and gave a plain-spoken, barn-burning speech that could make history and put her into serious contention to be the next President of the United States.There are only a handful of political speeches that have such historic impact. Barack Obama's keynote speech at the 2004 Democratic Convention comes readily to mind. It's what catapulted an obscure Illinois state Senator into the national limelight and put him on the path to becoming President.Warren's Senate speech was different, but just as electrifying.Obama's rhetoric was lofty, high-minded, and general, with a feel-good unifying message that there's no blue America or red America but only the United States of America.Warren's rhetoric is more down to earth, substantive, and frankly, angrier, unafraid of calling out by name the institutions--the big banks and Citigroup in particular--which tanked the economy, cost millions of Americans their jobs and homes, were bailed out with half a trillion dollars of taxpayer money, and then used their fortunes to buy Congress and make it more likely they'll be bailed out again. Moreover, she was unafraid to take on the President of her own party, and the numerous members of his administration drawn from Citigroup and other big banks through the endless revolving door between Washington and Wall Street.Here's the heart of Warren's speech:Democrats don't like Wall Street bailouts. Republicans don't like Wall Street bailouts. The American people are disgusted by Wall Street bailouts And yet here we are, five years after Dodd-Frank with Congress on the verge of ramming through a provision that would do nothing for the middle class, do nothing for community banks, do nothing but raise the risk that taxpayers will have to bail out the biggest banks once again... So let me say this to anyone who is listening at Citi[group]. I agree with you Dodd-Frank isn't perfect. It should have broken you into pieces! If this Congress is going to open up Dodd-Frank in the months ahead, then let's open it up to get tougher, not to create more bailout opportunities. If we're going to open up Dodd-Frank, let's open it up so that once and for all we end too big to fail and I mean really end it, not just say that we did. Instead of passing laws that create new bailout opportunities for too big to fail banks, let's pass... something... that would help break up these giant banks. A century ago Teddy Roosevelt was America's Trust-Buster. He went after the giant trusts and monopolies in this country, and a lot of people talk about how those trust deserved to be broken up because they had too much economic power. But Teddy Roosevelt said we should break them up because they had too much political power. Teddy Roosevelt said break them up because all that concentrated power threatens the very foundations of our democratic system. And now we're watching as Congress passes yet another provision that was written by lobbyists for the biggest recipient of bailout money in the history of this country. And its attached to a bill that needs to pass or else the entire federal government will grind to a halt. Think about that kind of power. If a financial institution has become so big and so powerful that it can hold the entire country hostage. That alone is reason enough to break them up. Enough is enough. Enough is enough with Wall Street insiders getting key position after key position and the kind of cronyism that we have seen in the executive branch. Enough is enough with Citigroup passing 11th hour deregulatory provisions that nobody takes ownership over but everybody will come to regret. Enough is enough Washington already works really well for the billionaires and the big corporations and the lawyers and the lobbyists. But what about the families who lost their homes or their jobs or their retirement savings the last time Citigroup bet big on derivatives and lost? What about the families who are living paycheck to paycheck and saw their tax dollars go to bail out Citi just 6 years ago? We were sent here to fight for those families. It is time, it is past time, for Washington to start working for them!Please take less than 10 minutes of your time to watch the speech below. Like Obama's 2004 Convention speech, it was an historic speech, a potentially game changing speech. It catapulted Warren from a potential nuisance to Hillary Clinton's coronation as the Democratic nominee to someone who could foreseeably win the nomination and even the Presidency.It transformed the conventional wisdom about American politics that the main divide is between left, right, and center, when it is really between pro-corporate and anti-corporate. Her declaration that neither Democrats nor Republicans (meaning the voters, not the Washington politicians) don't like bank bailouts rings loud and true. Tea party supporters don't like bailouts and crony capitalism any more that progressives do.The conventional wisdom is that to win white working and middle class voters, politicians need to move towards the center, meaning towards a more corporate approach. But in a world of growing inequality, stagnating wages, and a fading belief that with hard work your children can have a better life than you had, that may no longer be true.Hillary Clinton represents the old politics of the status quo and accommodation to Wall Street's power. Her husband's Treasury Secretary was former Goldman Sachs exec Robert Rubin. After leading Pres. Clinton's effort to dismantle the half-century old Glass-Steagel prohibition on government-insured commercial banks engaging in risky speculative bets which enabled the creation of financial megaliths like Citigroup, he went on to earn $126 million as a senior executive for Citigroup and brokered Citigroup's ½ Trillion Dollar bailout. His protégé, Timothy Geithner became Barack Obama's Treasury Secretary where he opposed breaking up the big banks who had cratered the economy.Elizabeth Warren represents a new politics in which, by challenging the power of the oligarchy, she has the potential of reclaiming the white working class for Democrats and uniting them with the coalition of professionals, single women, gays and minorities who elected Obama. She is the first major national politician in decades who is willing to openly challenge the power of the Wall Street oligarchy, in the manner of Franklin Delano Roosevelt who declared, \"They are unanimous in their hate for me -- and I welcome their hatred.\"With the increasingly dominant power of big money in politics, could Warren defeat Clinton, Inc. and then go on to defeat what is likely to be the near unanimous support of the Wall Street and corporate elite for her Republican opponent? It's hard to say. But the nation is in too much trouble to settle for a Democratic or Republican candidate of the corporatist status quo. If there's any hope, it's that once in a while the power of organized people can defeat the power of organized money. Elizabeth Warren represents that hope and it's the only thing worth hoping for.Watch Warren's 9:43 second speech below. If you're fed up with the power of Wall Street and the big banks, it will inspire you. And even if you aren't, watch it for its importance as a model of historically transformative political rhetoric.

              "63    A Kentucky mom shared her frustrations with a local high school's dress code after her daughter was allegedly sent to the principal's office for wearing an outfit that revealed her collarbone. Mom Stacie Dunn posted a photo of her daughter Stephanie on the first day of school wearing the \"inappropriate\" outfit in question.In the caption, she wrote, \"So this is my daughter at school today. I had to come to the school because according to her school principal what she is wearing is out of dress code and inappropriate for school.\"Dunn said that when she arrived at the school, she saw a group of female students in the principal's office for similar dress code violations. \"This is ridiculous! WOODFORD County High School and the principle have been enforcing a dress code where as girls can not show even there collar bones [sic] because it may distract their male class mates,\" she wrote on Facebook. \"Parents are being called away from their important jobs and students are missing important class time because they are showing their collarbones! Something needs to change!\"After receiving a phone call from the school about Stephanie's dress code violation, Dunn brought her daughter a scarf to wear. But the saga continued when the outfit was still deemed inappropriate, and the teen was ultimately sent home after \"giving the principal an attitude,\" the mom claims in a follow-up Facebook post.The following day, the mom launched a petition to help Stephanie and her fellow students change their school's dress code. It currently has over 4,300 signtatures.Woodford County High School's 10-year-old dress code has been a source of tension in the past. In March, student Maggie Sunseri released a documentary featuring a series of interviews with female students, as well as the school principal, Rob Akers.Titled \"Shame: A Documentary on School Dress Code,\" the 33-minute film highlights some of the students' issues with the dress code, which mandates that shirts cover their collarbones and that shorts and skirts to be knee-length or longer.Though Stacie Dunn's daughter Stephanie is not featured in the film, the girls interviewed express the same kinds of concerns she shared this week. They say they feel embarrassed and ashamed about being \"called out\" for \"revealing\" outfits that show their collarbones, that it's difficult to find acceptable clothes for schools, that the rules are not uniformly enforced and that it's absurd to be forced to missed class because of these unfair standards.As a result, they say they feel distracted with worry about whether or not each teacher will deem their outfits appropriate and fear that they may be humiliated. In the documentary, Principal Akers cites removing distraction as a motivating factor behind dress codes, though he adds he was not at Woodford County High School when this particular policy was implemented during the 2004-05 school year. In his past experience as an administrator, he says, \"issues with sexual harassment\" among students prompted stricter dress codes.\"Certain outfits that [female students] wore created this situation where guys would make inappropriate statements, and there was a distraction to the learning environment based on what some of the folks were wearing at school,\" he says in the film.But the girls believe that it's unfair to limit female students' clothing options instead of addressing the harassment issues more directly with male students. \"It sends the message to boys that it's all girls' fault, basically -- any reaction or any action that they do is the girl's fault,\" one girl says in the film. \"It wasn't their fault that they were staring or got distracted. It's the girls' fault.\"In an interview with The Huffington Post this week, Sunseri said the inspiration behind her film and her opposition to the dress code \"has little to do with clothing and more to do with the underlying message behind a code that tells young women to cover up and young boys that they can't control themselves.\" The 16-year-old high school junior said the dress code is sexist toward both girls and boys in that it \"perpetuates the notion that a woman's body is inherently more sexual than a man's body, and that young boys' natural tendencies are to harass or assault women.\"Sunseri added that she believes this is a widespread problem in schools and greater society across the nation, not just at Woodford County High School. \"This is a time when we are already trying to figure out our place in the world, and on top of that we are made to feel guilty about the body parts we were born with.\"Principal Akers told HuffPost in response to last week's incident that his school's dress code is not about \"sexualizing the collarbone\" but having \"measurable\" metrics that allow the rules to be applied fairly. He also added that he's always been open to discussing students' concerns and making adjustments to the rules but that no one has ever tried to meet with him.Until now. Since the recent incident with Stacie Dunn and her daughter Stephanie, Sunseri has come forward with a proposal for a new dress code. After making small changes to the proposal in a meeting with Principal Akers', she presented it at a school meeting on August 17 in front of a council of parents, teachers and administrators. According to Akers and Sunseri, the council moved the proposal to a committee for review and asked the junior to put together a group of students to join the committee in this task. Then, the council as a whole will consider a proposal from the committee at the next meeting on September 21. Sunseri's proposed dress code, which she considers an exercise in compromise, would allow for sleeveless shirts with straps that are at least three fingertips wide, skirts and dresses that meet the \"fingertip rule\" for length and shirts that meet the \"credit card rule\" -- a credit card length from the bottom of the throat to the top of the shirt. The rules would also permit leggings and yoga pants as long as a top covered the front and back sides. If passed, the code would go into effect in January. Stacie Dunn expressed her joy at the prospect for real change in a Facebook post. \"Hopefully the outcome will be favorable!\" she wrote. Principal Akers told HuffPost that he applauds Sunseri's initiative, both in making the documentary and following through with tangible action. \"Everyone always wanted the dress code to change, but no one was willing to do anything about it,\" Sunseri said in her interview, adding, \"I hope that anyone reading my story feels empowered to go out and make changes within their own community.\"H/T

              "64    Every Jobs Day during the past recession, and for several years after, Bill McBride of the blog Calculated Risk compiled what Business Insider came to call \"the scariest jobs chart ever,\" a comparison of the payroll employment trajectories during every recession since World War II. He made the last one after the May 2014 jobs report, when employment finally rose above its pre-recession peak. It looked like this:In short, it was a really bad recession, far and away the worst since the 1930s.QuickTake Monthly U.S. Jobs ReportBut what about the recovery? How's that going? I took the opportunity of today's jobs data release to compare the growth in payroll employment since it bottomed out in February 2010 with the growth in payroll employment after past recessions.For the sake of readability I didn't chart every recovery since World War II, going instead with the five most recent -- skipping the one that began in July 1980 because it only lasted 12 months. And I date my recoveries from the month when employment hit bottom, which doesn't always coincide with the recession dates set by the National Bureau of Economic Research. The NBER says the first recession of the new millennium ended in November 2001, but payroll employment didn't start rising until late 2003.The clearest takeaway here is that the current jobs recovery looks an awful lot like the last two -- much slower and steadier than the boom of the Reagan years and the even steeper and more erratic rise during the Ford and Carter presidencies. Look at McBride's chart and you can see that the pre-1975 recoveries were similarly steep. Something changed after the 1980s; my guess is that it was some combination of the disappearance of manufacturing jobs -- which tended to be cut back sharply in a recession and added back rapidly during the subsequent rebound -- and an increasing corporate focus on productivity, driven by pressure from Wall Street, that has made managers wary of hiring even when the economy improves. This may be the wrong way to look at it. Because the last recession was so much more severe than the previous two, there was much more ground to regain this time around -- and as my colleague Mark Whitehouse pointed out this morning, we're still a couple million jobs away from regaining it. There are those who argue that state and federal fiscal austerity have weighed on job growth since the recession; there are also those who argue that new \"subsidies and regulations intended to help the poor and unemployed\" have perversely held back the recovery.Still, I think it is worth dwelling on how the current jobs recovery is unfolding at almost exactly the same pace as the last two. Maybe this is just the way the job market works now. And while the recovery that began in 2003 is now seen as something of a bust, the 1990s are looked back upon fondly as a time of widespread prosperity. That's because the 2000s jobs recovery didn't last very long -- as you can see from the above chart, it had already given way to a new recession by this point. The 1990s version, meanwhile, went on and on and on.So that's really the key. If the economy keeps adding 200,000 jobs a month for the rest of this year, and next year, and the year after that, this will start looking like a pretty great economic recovery.

              "65    Paul Rosalie, we’re sorry to report, was not eaten alive by an anaconda tonight on Discovery’s special, Eaten Alive.  He got hugged and kissed instead. When the snake hugging proved too much for one of his lower arms —  Rosalie had insisted on taking off the lower-arm section of his special crush-proof suit for mobility sake —  he bailed.Twitter was not amused:Geraldo prob just watched #EatenAlive and high-fived himself. His \"Al Capone's vault\" special is no longer the biggest letdown in TV history — Harrison Golden (@harrisongolden) December 8, 2014Next on Discovery…\"Finding the Tooth Fairy\" where I spend two hours looking for the Tooth Fairy, give up and get a burrito. #EatenAlive — Matt Lindner (@mattlindner) December 8, 2014WAIT THE SNAKE DIDN'T EVEN EAT THE GUY? I've been #EatenAlive by exactly as many anacondas as the host of this ridiculous show? — David Shiffman (@WhySharksMatter) December 8, 2014This was probably not what Discovery had in mind when, early on in the telecast, it tweeted:Last month, Discovery and Paul Rosolie had asked the media to swallow a whopper — Rosolie would attempt to be eaten alive by an anaconda, for all the anacondas out there who have no voice. Some bit.In Eaten Alive, Rosolie said, he would attempt to be swallowed by a 25-to-27-foot anaconda “that slippedthrough his hands and nearly dragged him to the bottom of the floating forest” that happened “on his one and only previous expedition to this secluded part of the Amazonian jungle.” But one hour and 40 minutes into the two-hour special, Rosolie was seen failing entirely to capture that anaconda, and they instead had to use some understudy welterweight anaconda they had lying around because, Rosolie explained, he was still intent upon getting crushed and swallowed by an anaconda, for the sake of the snakes.While failing to produce much drama, the special did cough up some great anaconda-theme ads, including a Man Up Moment repeat of a moment during the special in which Rosolie dives into the water in pursuit of a snake — brought to you by Every Kiss Begins with Kay Jewelers —  as well as an ad mocking the show while plugging  an online contact lens store. That company nicked the show again in its own tweet after the telecast was over:In its news release, Discovery Channel described Rosolie “as snake researcher and conservationist… who has dedicated his career to studying the Giant Green Anaconda.”In an interview with adventure travel web site Curious Animal, published May 16, 2014, Rosolie described thusly his research and conservation work on the world’s largest anaconda:“I have a six-foot arm span and I jumped on a snake where I couldn’t wrap my arms around the snake. That’s a giant snake…She kept moving with me on her back, so I was riding an anaconda and she didn’t even seem to mind.”Rosolie said he was in “extreme danger” when he hitched a ride on the back of the snake — for research purposes, we now know– adding, “I don’t know why I jumped on it, except I was so excited and amazed to see an animal like that. I think I just needed that experience of getting to touch it.”Last month, while Discovery Channel said Rosolie would “attempt something no one has ever dared: to be EATEN ALIVE,” Rosolie himself floated his “I did it for the Rain Forest and all its living creatures” defense:“I’ve seen first-hand how the Amazon Rainforest is being destroyed. It is so rampant that we may be the last generation with the opportunity to save it. People need to wake up to what is going on. What better way is there to shock people than to put my life on the line with the largest snake on the planet, the Green Anaconda?” he asked rhetorically, since he’d previously been compelled to reveal the stunt already had been shot, and the snake had survived his publicity stunt, in response to the growing din of critics. Discovery Channel tried to drown that din, by announcing that the anaconda that attempted to dine on Rosolie was alive and well. Discovery added that the Lumpy Ninja get-up Rosolie wore during his attempt to force himself, meal-wise, on the snake who was just minding her own business in the floating forest, was “built to ensure the snake’s safety just as much as it was to protect Rosolie’s life.” This, in response to nearly 38,000 signatures on a Change.org petition to persuade Discovery Communications to dump this special it describes as made-for-TV animal abuse.

              "69    UPDATE: Beyonce pulled a fast one on us and bunched up what is actually a dress to make it look like a swimsuit. The good news? You can buy one here.PREVIOUSLY: Let's be honest: Beyonce could wear anything under the sun and look absolutely amazing in it. (Reminder: she's Beyonce.) But this one-piece was made. for. her.The photo she posted to Beyonce.com says it all, but in case you were temporarily blinded by her beauty and couldn't read, the swimsuit says: \"99 Problems But My Ass Ain't One.\" And truer words have never been spoken:Of course, the swimsuit borrows a line from her husband Jay Z's song, \"99 Problems,\" but we'd like to think Queen Bey was singing \"Bootylicious\" in her head as the cameras snapped.

              "75    Getty ImagesWill Venable is a free agent this winter and it's highly unlikely he'll be a part of the Texas Rangers in 2016, but Venable is a pretty nice player and now he's a member of the Rangers for a stretch run after they acquired him from the San Diego Padres on Tuesday evening.Venable was acquired for Low-A catcher Marcus Greene and a player to be named later in a post-waiver move, and it's pretty surprising he made it to the Rangers.Moreland Near Top of Rangers' WAR ListVenable is a nice piece for the Rangers to add, even though it was a bit surprising to see them go get a left-handed bat when they still need right-handed bats (and might still get one). So why would they get him? Well, it's pretty simple. He can play center field, and do it pretty well.Sure, Delino DeShields is the starting center fielder for this club, but he hits right-handed. DeShields has earned the right to be more than a platoon option, and he'll remain the starter in center, but Leonys Martin is trying to play through a cracked hamate bone and won't be an option in Arlington anymore, and Josh Hamilton shouldn't play in center given his fragility. Hamilton will miss his fourth straight game on Wednesday with a sore knee and also is no lock to play left field, which Venable can also do.Hamilton Hopes to Return in DetroitSo who is Will Venable? Well, he's batting .258/.318/.378 with 10 doubles, three triples and six homers to go with 30 RBIs and 11 stolen bases in 98 games this year. He's no star, but he's going to provide some great depth as the Rangers buckle down and go for it this year, which is something we never could've seen them doing a couple of months ago.Copyright NBC

              "78    Play Tucker Carlson says the United States needs a \"White Guy Appreciation Day.\" youtube.comRepublicans are expected to make big gains in the 2014 midterm elections and if they do, it won't be with much help from young voters and minorities. While Democrats are worried about low turn out from their key voting blocs, Republicans continue to make do with a heavy white majority. One Fox News host doesn't think that white men have gotten the respect they deserve and made sure to make his point known.youtube.comEver since Barack Obama was elected as the President of the United States in 2008, the issue of race has become one that ignites many debates. Some say that the political left uses the race card to their advantage, while others believe that conservatives on the right invoke policies that continue to work against African Americans and other minorities. Democrats traditionally secure a large majority of the minority vote, gaining over 90 percent of the black vote, and over 70 percent of the Hispanic vote in the 2012 election.Republicans often get labeled as the party that is out of touch, led by older white males who aren't adapt to a changing America. This topic was discussed on the November 2 edition of \"Fox and Friends\" on Fox News. Co-host of the show \"The Five,\" Dana Perino joined the panel and was asked about the stigma the Republicans have of being the party that is consisted of older white men. \"You will hear that, it's been beaten into our heads, that Republicans are too old, too white, too male. And that is true demographically if you look across the board,\" Perino said, before noting, 'there is no doubt that Republicans have a lot of work to do.\"\"I've been talking to a lot of campaigns, with a lot of younger people, it's impressive to see what the RNC has done to diversify their ranks,\" Perino made sure to mention. When it comes to the majority of the youth vote, Perino doesn't believe that Republicans will make huge gains, but will do enough to push them over the top during the midterms.\"They're not gonna necessarily win all the youth vote, but could they win enough to help some of our candidates, Republicans, win.

              "82    During the explorations, as humans worked their way in observing the uncharted parts of the moon, archived photos of the Apollo missions gave the idea that other living things might have been watching the explorers as well. Apparently, one particular photo suggested that aliens might really exist.The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) launched the first Apollo mission in 1969, which brought the first humans to land on the moon's untouched surface. Various manned missions took place until 1972. Looking back, Apollo 15 was the first of the Apollo \"J\" missions that was capable of staying on the moon for a longer period of time and has also shown greater surface mobility. The objective was basically to explore the Hadley-Appenine region of the moon and be able to set-up and perform lunar scientific experiments. The mission also aims to make engineering evaluations of new Apollo equipment, conduct lunar orbital experiments and take shots of the said region.Apparently, several alleged sightings of unidentified flying objects or UFO's were recorded around the world. But while researchers were browsing through the old images of the Apollo 15 mission, one of them noticed that an image of a UFO was captured on one of the photos, Tech Times reports. For some, the image could have been some debris that was captured by the camera while some claim that it could be a result of the photo's developing process. On the other hand, some say that the image might have been formed by a fragment of dust on the camera but some non-believers say that it was just developing error. UFO believers and enthusiasts believe that the image that was discovered was actually that of an alien which observes human explorers and the alleged image of a UFO might have been fascinated with the astronauts.In other news, it was reported that a commercial airline pilot from London's Heathrow Airport said that they had encountered and has almost hit a ball-shaped UFO. The pilot added that his aircraft almost had contact with the unidentified flying object, but as described by the pilot, the silvery metallic-like orb surprisingly maneuvered and flew a feet above the airplane. However, reports say that \"it wasn't possible to either trace the object or determine the cause of the sighting.\"Email Address: edgereyesjr@gmail.comTo contact the editor, e-mail:

\"The Weeknd\" 'cause he transformed his Uber ride into a full-on music video for the song \"Can't Feel My Face\" ... and everyone involved seemed to love it.He may not be able to feel his face but he better make sure he feels the steering wheel while he's driving.

              "89    By Amie Parnes and Justin Sink - 11/09/14 06:00 AM ESTAs President Obama congratulated Republican lawmakers for “running very strong campaigns” during a meeting Friday at the White House, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (Nev.) stared, stone-faced, into the distance.Reid was seated at the president’s elbow, but in many ways, the gulf between the two leaders has never seemed greater.Tension between Obama and Reid has been long simmering, multiple sources with knowledge of their relationship say. It exploded into the headlines following Tuesday’s landslide victory for Republicans.Within minutes of networks declaring that Republicans had seized back the Senate, the Washington Post published a report featuring David Krone, Reid’s chief of staff, blasting President Obama for the party’s losses.Krone described Obama as a drag on Democratic candidates across the country, with the president’s sagging approval ratings and the administration’s botched implementation of ObamaCare steepening the gradient that vulnerable incumbents had to climb. Moreover, Krone charged, the White House had kept Senate Democrats from tapping some of the president’s most loyal donors.The hit was the political equivalent of the kind of uppercut Reid might have delivered during his boxing career.Democratic sources said the Majority Leader was aware of Krone’s cooperation with the Post, and that his office disapproves of staffers who freelance to the press. One Democratic operative described the story as \"a way to protect Reid for the losses that we knew we were going to face.”“The way it was done was to ensure that people knew Reid had no fault.”Reinforcing the notion that the Post story was an ordered hit, Reid’s communications director, Adam Jentleson, retweeted multiple links to the story.The White House, for its part, publicly insisted there was nothing to see there.Press secretary Josh Earnest argued the comments did not represent the true relationship between Reid and Obama, noting the pair had worked effectively on a slew of the president’s priorities. And an administration official said the White House had been fielding calls from senators, Senate chiefs of staff, top operatives, and Democratic lobbyists insisting that they did not share Krone’s views.But Earnest betrayed the administration’s annoyance with the story when pressed as to whether there was a need for the president to mend fences with the majority leader.“Well, if there is, I'm confident that's something that the President and Senator Reid, given their strong track record, will be able to take care of,” Earnest said. “If they do that, I doubt it will be published in The Washington Post, frankly.”One Democrat familiar with the White House’s thinking said the perception at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue was that Krone was looking to shift blame squarely to Obama for Tuesday night’s devastating results.  Despite the public friction, the White House and Reid’s office have worked closely on preparing a lame duck agenda, including new funding requests to fight Ebola and to pursue the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Both Obama and Reid are also eager to advance dozens of the president’s appointees before Republicans seize control of the upper chamber.But those familiar with the Reid-Obama dynamic say that there has also been tension between the two since at least 2011, when the president had plans to negotiate a big debt limit deal. That never came to pass. \"I think how the president and his team — and I emphasize his team — mishandled the debt limit negotiations left a sour taste, and it's never really recovered since then,” said one source familiar with the negotiations.That friction has only been exacerbated by tension over access to the president’s donors. White House lawyers told the Senate Majority PAC not to contact donors for more than a week after the president headlined events for the fundraising group, expressing concerns that doing so would violate federal election laws. In the Post story, Krone accused Obama of creating that rule ad hoc.\"Money has been a long-standing frustration,\" a source said. \"Every two years, they've gone to the White House, asked for help and they haven't always gotten it.\"An individual familiar with the White House’s thinking said that view irked those within the administration who saw the restrictions as a genuine necessity.The White House has also defended the president’s role in the midterm campaign, noting that the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has publicly endorsed the president’s work on behalf of Democratic candidates.“I do think that a bit of the hyperbole over the president is overplayed,” DSCC director Guy Cecil said at a Playbook lunch after the election. “He’s done everything we’ve asked.”Those on both sides of the relationship downplay the notion of any personal animosity between Reid and Obama.\"Neither of them are social people so calling them 'friends' would be a ridiculous term,” said one operative. \"But they've always respected each other and the president has trusted Reid to carry out his agenda in the Senate. But that said, the executive and legislative branches will always have bumps here and there. But other than small frustrations, it's never been anything big.\"Moreover, there was even a grudging respect in some quarters for the manner in which Krone’s hit was delivered. \"A lot of people in this town will stab you in the back,” said one Democratic strategist. “But David is very much a stab-you-in-the-front kind of guy. He wanted to make sure the White House knew it was coming from him and I think a lot of people respect that.”While the Post story stung, there’s little indication it will permanently spoil Reid and Obama’s relationship. The White House believes there are too many policy priorities for the two not to continue working together closely. Reid loyalists agree, saying there’s little chance of the White House freezing him out.\"How are they going to take it out on him?\" the operative pondered aloud, regarding the White House. \"They still need Sen. Reid. I'm sure they're upset. No one wants to be called out. But retribution? I don't think they have either the muscle or the inclination to do that.\"

              "92    Cable subscriptions are plummeting so rapidly that some cable companies’ growth rates are in the negatives.According to Pacific Crest, a Wall Street research firm, the top eight cable providers had subscriptions fall 463,000 in the second quarter of 2015. In the same quarter last year, the top cable providers had a decline of 141,000 subscriptions, the firm’s research, obtained by Business Insider, said.Image via Pacific CrestThe research firm also said the year-over-year growth for the first half of 2015 was in the negative for some cable companies such as Time Warner or Comcast, leading Business Insider to call their data the “scariest chart in the history of cable TV.”But while cable companies are seeing a decline in numbers, the opposite is true for internet movie and television streaming services such as Netflix. The number of households that subscribe to Netflix has nearly doubled — from 18 percent to 35 percent — since the third quarter of 2011.Netflix also had a 20 percent subscriber growth in the second quarter last year, according to Pacific Crest. Amazon had a subscriber growth of 40 percent, and Hulu had a growth of 45 percent.Image via Pacific CrestIn May, Charter Communications announced it planned to buy Time Warner Cable for more than $55 billion as more cable companies move to consolidate.Read more of Pacific Crest’s findings at Business Insider.

Upon his return, the game show host, with a level of exasperation unbecoming of a man wearing a Hawaiian shirt, blurted out, “Who said anything about a horse?”Watch Sajak's spur-of-the-moment

              "100   Women, you really can have both a family and a fulfilling career. You just have to do it just right. (Men, you get more freedom.) A new study from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis looks into how having a family affects women and men. As it turns out, it's complicated.The study (a hat-tip to Wonkblog's Ylan Q. Mui for highlighting it) focuses on academic economists and finds that moms are more productive than non-moms throughout their careers. But having a kid at the wrong time — or alone — or having too many kids — can make a mother far, far less productive.What they studiedResearchers looked at the research output of economists, measuring the impacts of their publications by using RePEc, an online database of economics papers. They created indexes to measure the impact of those economists' research, then matched that data up with the more than 10,000 responses they received to surveys asking detailed questions about the economists' academic careers, as well as family lives — when children were born, how many there are, and how it affected their work lives.What they foundFirst, the simplest finding: \"We find in our entire sample of about 10,000 male and female economists that men's productivity is not associated with their family situation in an economically significant manner.\" In fact, they find a small uptick in productivity for untenured men who become fathers — an uptick that may be attributable to the \"provider effect,\" says Krapf: these men may feel added pressure to produce once they have kids.The situation is more complicated for women. First off, moms are more productive than non-moms throughout their careers. The below charts show childless, one-child, and multiple-child women's productivity as measured by a publication index the authors created for this report.(Source: Krapf et al.)It's not all bad news: researchers found that a mom's first child is not significantly associated with a hit to the mother's productivity. But more kids change that outcome. The authors write that the results imply \"a mother of three children has, on average, a research record reflecting a loss of four years of research output by the time all of her children have reached their teens.\" A mother of two, likewise, has a 2.5-year loss of output.But even if a woman does only have one child, there are other factors that can drag on her productivity. Childrens' ages matter, too, for example. Moms of young children, for example, see their productivity drop off 15 to 17 percent, compared to childless women.And family planning plays a huge role. Having a kid before age 30 is associated with a drag on productivity by 13 percent, and unintended pregnancy (which they define as pregnancies in unpartnered moms who were uninformed about their childcare options) pulls productivity down 13 to 17 percent. Meanwhile, there's no effect for women having kids in their early 30s, and only a small (but statistically insignificant) effect for women in their late 30s.With all that taken into account, it appears there's a specific window in which to have the optimal family, so long as it's small: \"Women who become mothers in the 30- to 34-year age bracket fare substantially better; having an only child at that time of their careers does not appear to be detrimental to their research productivity,\" the authors write.So 29-to-33-year-old childless-and-married ladies should get cracking.What it meansThere are a few big questions this study raises: for example, despite the obvious productivity hits they suffer form having kids, moms seem to remain more productive throughout their academic careers. Why?One reason for this, says one of the paper's authors, could be the types of women likely to have kids: \"The most likely reason may be selection, i.e. women who are more productive in the first place may be more likely to become mothers,\" says Matthias Krapf, a professor at the University of Zurich.But it also implies what many women already know: that they have to think really, really hard about how to manage their working lives once they have kids — more so than men do.\"All of these results suggest that a first child need not destroy any academic career plans. Female academics who carefully project ahead and responsibly orchestrate their private lives appear to be well able to cope with motherhood — at least when they have only one child,\" the authors write.What it doesn't meanFirst off, it would be hard to generalize this study to all working women in the US. This is a study of academics — people for whom it's likely easier to have kids than, say, for minimum wage workers, thanks to all sorts of factors like higher pay, job security, access to child care, and paid family leave.Furthermore, it doesn't mean motherhood is exactly great for a woman's career. Several studies have found evidence of a motherhood penalty. In addition, despite the fact that it's illegal to discriminate against pregnant women, complaints about this type of discrimination are still commonplace, 36 years after it became illegal.In addition, the authors point out that there could be something misleading in the data showing all those super-productive late-career moms.\"[O]ur results are sensitive to survivor bias, i.e., women who become most unproductive and quit the profession after becoming mothers are not included in our sample,\" writes Krapf. In other words, if kids really kill a woman's productivity, she might drop out, leaving only the most uber-productive moms at the office.

              "101   NEW YORK (AP) -- Eric Garner was overweight and in poor health. He was a nuisance to shop owners who complained about him selling untaxed cigarettes on the street. When police came to arrest him, he resisted. And if he could repeatedly say, \"I can't breathe,\" it means he could breathe.Rank-and-file New York City police officers and their supporters have been making such arguments even before a grand jury decided against charges in Garner's death, saying the possibility that he contributed to his own demise has been drowned out in the furor over race and law enforcement.Officers say the outcry has left them feeling betrayed and demonized by everyone from the president and the mayor to throngs of protesters who scream at them on the street.\"Police officers feel like they are being thrown under the bus,\" said Patrick Lynch, president of the police union.The grand jury this week cleared a white patrolman, Daniel Pantaleo, who was caught on video applying what appeared to be an illegal chokehold on the black man. Mayor Bill de Blasio said the case underscores the NYPD's need to improve relations with minorities.But Lynch said: \"What we did not hear is this: You cannot go out and break the law. What we did not hear is that you cannot resist arrest. That's a crime.\"At the noisy demonstrations that have broken out over the past few days, protesters have confronted police who had nothing to do with the case. Signs read: \"NYPD: Blood on your hands,\" \"Racism kills\" and \"Hey officers, choke me or shoot me.\" Some demonstrators shouted, \"NYPD pigs!\" More than 280 people have been arrested, and more demonstrations were planned Friday.In private and on Internet chat rooms, officers say they feel demoralized, misunderstood and \"all alone.\"Some are advising each other that the best way to preserve their careers is to stop making arrests like that of Garner's, in defiance of the NYPD's campaign of cracking down on minor \"quality of life\" offenses as a way to discourage serious crime.\"Everyone is just demonizing the police,\" said Maki Haberfeld, a professor of police studies at John Jay College of criminal justice. \"But police follow orders and laws. Nobody talks about the responsibility of the politicians to explain to the community why quality-of-life enforcement is necessary.\"The fatal encounter occurred in July after Pantaleo and other police officers responded to complaints about Garner, a heavyset 43-year-old father of six.The video showed Garner telling officers to leave him alone and refusing to be handcuffed. Pantaleo, an eight-year veteran, appeared to wrap his arm around Garner's neck and take him down to the ground with the help of other officers.Garner could be heard saying, \"I can't breathe,\" several times before he went motionless.The medical examiner later found that a chokehold resulted in Garner's death, but also that asthma, obesity and cardiovascular disease were contributing factors.While many have decried the death of another black man at the hands of a white officer, no evidence has come to light to suggest that Pantaleo's actions were racially motivated. His supervising sergeant at the scene was black, and so were some of the officers involved in the confrontation.As the video sparked accusations of excessive force, the police unions mounted a counter-narrative: that Garner would still be alive if he had obeyed orders, that his poor health was the main cause of his death and that Pantaleo had used an authorized takedown move - more like a headlock than a chokehold - to subdue him.While the grand jury proceedings were secret, Pantaleo's lawyer has said that the officer testified that he never tried to choke Garner and did not believe the man was in mortal danger.Pantaleo's defenders have included Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who argued that the grand jury outcome would have been the same if Garner had been white, and that police were right to ignore his pleas that he couldn't breathe.\"The fact that he was able to say it meant he could breathe,\" said King, the son of a police officer.\"And if you've ever seen anyone locked up, anyone resisting arrest, they're always saying, `You're breaking my arm, you're killing me, you're breaking my neck.' So if the cops had eased up or let him go at that stage, the whole struggle would have started in again.\"Related Gallery: Reactions to the Eric Garner case

              "106   Baylor lost out on the final spot in the College Football Playoff to Ohio State.The two teams both had one loss and both won their conferences. Baylor's two best wins (TCU, Kansas State) were arguably better than OSU's (Michigan State, Wisconsin). Baylor's loss to 7-5 West Virgina on the road was also better than Ohio State's 14-point loss to 6-6 Virginia Tech at home.So what gives?In the end, it came down to strength of schedule. Both teams were 11-1, and Ohio State played better teams, so they made it in.The playoff committee taught Baylor a lesson that's going to resonate across the college football world — you can no longer get away with playing nobody in the non-conference.Baylor got penalized for playing the weakest non-conference schedule of any playoff contender. Outside of the Big 12, Baylor played SMU, Northwestern State, and Buffalo this year.Playing small schools like this is a relic from the old system. In order to get bowl eligible, teams used to schedule weak teams in the non-conference to inflate their win totals. That's why the first few weeks of the college football season largely consist of big teams destroying small teams by 30.Those days are over. By leaving Baylor out of the playoff, the committee has set a precedent that playing a legitimate non-conference schedule is a prerequisite for playoff consideration.\"I think this is going to be a wake-up call for our schools and others around the country,\" Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby told ESPN on Sunday afternoon. \"The committee has made it clear that non-conference strength of schedule is something they're going to evaluate.\"Perennial powers beating up on small teams is a thing of the past, and it's a major shift in the sport. Going forward, we're going to have a bunch of monster non-conference matchups over the first few weeks of the year. Smart programs saw this coming. Ever since the playoff was adopted, teams have been scrambling to beef up their future non-conference schedules. Just look at the current schedule for September 3, 2016:Alabama-USC LSU-Wisconsin UCLA-Texas A&M Notre Dame-Texas Clemson-AuburnMore than ever before, we're seeing big schools schedule losable non-conference games against other elite programs.Baylor is one of the teams that has yet to beef up its schedule. They play SMU, Lamar, and Rice in the non-conference next year, and Northwestern State, SMU, and Rice in 2016. If they don't rethink that schedule, they could find themselves in the same situation again.More From Business InsiderThe 32 Best Prospects In The 2015 NFL Draft The 20 Highest-Paid Coaches In College

              "111   There are approximately 1.3 million apps available for our smartphones and tablets. Many are simply a bad idea. Most are average in use or scope. Fortunately, some very innovative developers have changed the way we used to do things for the better. Here are five mind-boggling apps that I know you're going to want.1. Preserve old photosYou probably have photo albums and shoeboxes full of old print photos. If you take care of them they should last for decades, but during a move, house fire or natural disaster they might get damaged or destroyed. Plus, if they're sitting in a box or on the shelf, no one else can enjoy them.That's why so many people spend hours scanning photos into a computer to preserve and share them. Unfortunately, scanning is a slow process.You have to take the photo out of the photobook, put it on a scanner and wait for a while. Once you've scanned it, there's still a lot of work you have to do. You need to crop it, straighten it, color correct and clean up any scanning artifacts.Now, there's an app that makes preserving print photos a snap, literally. It's called Heirloom (Free; iOS, Android). You simply take a picture of a photo and it does the cropping and color correcting automatically. You can even leave photos in their albums, so you don't risk damaging or losing them.Once the photo is ready, you can upload it to Facebook, Twitter or another site, or upload it to Heirloom's own social network. You can upload as many photos as you want. So, what are you waiting for?2. Get better customer serviceHow many hours of your life have you spent on hold waiting for customer service? It's probably more than a few. You could be doing much better things with your time.That's what makes the FastCustomer app (Free; iOS, Android) such a must-have. Once you call customer service, it waits on hold for you. When the customer service agent picks up, FastCustomer rings you so you can talk to them. How neat is that?3. Record your sleepPlenty of people talk in their sleep, but unless there's someone else listening, you never know what you said. Fire up Sleep Talk Recorder (Free; iOS, Android) before hitting the hay and it will start recording when you start talking, or snoring.The next day, you can listen to everything. It's also good for detecting potential health problems like sleep apnea.4. See more of the world around youIn sci-fi movies with robots, there's often a scene where you see the world from the robot's point of view. It usually shows that the robot has a fancy overlay showing extra information about everything it's seeing.You can do the same thing, and you don't even need fancy new technology like Google Glass or Oculus Rift. Just grab an augmented reality app like Tagwhat (Free; iOS, Android).Using the app, point your smartphone or tablet camera at a business to look up its information on the Web, Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare and other social sites. You can even see comments and reviews from other people.Point the app at landmarks to get more information, or just cruise around town and let the app tell you about deals and events near you, or even just cool stories.5. Measure distance without a rulerHave you ever needed to take a measurement, but didn't have a ruler or tape measure handy? Perhaps the object was too big or too far away to measure by hand? With this clever app, you can measure nearly anything from small items inside your home to objects like buildings and more.EasyMeasure(Free; iOS, Android) lets you point your smartphone or tablet's camera at any object and see the object's dimensions on the screen. Now it does take a little work from you, unless you have a phone or tablet with Intel's RealSense camera like the Dell Venue 8 7000. Still, once you get the hang of it, you'll find plenty of ways to use it.On the Kim Komando Show, the nation's largest weekend radio talk show, Kim takes calls and dispenses advice on today's digital lifestyle, from smartphones and tablets to online privacy and data hacks.

              "117   This morning I arose in a very cold house. It was 48 degrees in the warmest part of the living room. How cold is that? Well, I'll put it this way. I woke up to the sound of my dog drinking out of the toilet, strike that, cracking through a layer of ice to drink from the toilet! Now, that is something not everyone can claim they've experienced. And as awful as that may sound to some of you, know I could have avoided it. It was a choice. The farmhouse has two wood stoves, one in the back mudroom near the plumbing and one in the living room. Had I stoked both the fires and got up a little earlier it could have been a lot more comfortable than this, but since the temperature wasn't dropping below zero outside I chose to put my energy towards sleep instead of comfort.And sleep I did! I got a solid eight hours under wool and sheepskins, Gibson the border collie curled up under the covers by my chest. Together we are a kindled fire and were warm as could be inside our little nest. I woke up smiling in the dark and watched the steam rise off my skin and swirl in the air around my curvy body. I laughed in absolute joy at this, because I'm not sure what could be more proof positive that I am alive and well in this windy world? Fire always win the battle over ice, and I am a goddamned furnace.Now, I wanted to share what happened next because I think it may bring some of you out of a place of worry or despair and into one of joy and power. I started a fire. Hear me out.When I laid in bed I knew I had the farm chores out in the biting air, some hunting to do in the icy forest, and a list of deadlines, bills, worries, and obligations. I knew I was behind in the mortgage, over my head in many ways. I am not waking up to a world of financial or physical comforts by any stretch, and that is because of the choices I made in my life. I could either sit in bed with wide eyes and fret about these things, let worries about money consume me, let the easy heat of the undercover realm keep me prisoner, and give up. Just roll over and pray to win the lottery...Or I could get up and let my skin steam.I headed over the that wood stove, naked and crouching, like something out of a National Geographic about primal man's first invention of fire. I opened the stove and saw all I needed to see. The keystone that changed my view on the entire day: hot coals. I opened the tightly-sealed woodstove and the first flash of oxygen lifted those coals from embers into sparks and a red light lit up my face in the darkness. A red light I created through a lineage of choices, from installing the stove years ago, to harvesting firewood, to stoking the fire last night, to opening it this morning to let that light shine on me. Next to the stove was a hatchet, some light pine, and paper. I had all the tools I needed to start a real fire, right there next to me! Another series of choices I put in place. And what do fires offer? Comfort, heat, warm water, energy! I chopped up some wood and within moments I had kindling. I placed it in a all tee pee around a red coal. It smoked and then erupted in flames and soon I had a proper fire. I added larger dry wood around that little triangle and soon a small dance of atoms was a true roaring stove blaster. Guys, fire was there all along, I just needed to bring it into being with the right tools, preparation and knowledge.I got dressed, made coffee, let the dogs out, and started my day. The animals were fed, the farm is humming, and I already started a new logo project for a reader's farm and handed over a new comp sheet of logos to another college for their draft horse club. This was work I was trained to do and helps bring income to this farm. It's an act of creation, of skill, of light just like that fire. I avoided Facebook, Paypal, Reddit, Twitter... the whole damn Internet. I didn't want someone else's picture of their 10-point buck or engagement ring or new kitchen counters or Instagrams starting my day with any sense of lacking. Not because other people's joy makes me sad, but it's hard for anyone to see such things and not feel she is already starting the day needing to be something besides the naked, laughing, perfect rubenesque farm goddess she already is.Nothing puts out an inner fire like self doubt. So I just did my work in this morning storm of creativity. See, when I was naked and cold in the dark all I saw was a hint of possibility: a red coal. But I knew with every piece of my being that dry wood, a little effort, and a hatchet would be the perfect combination of intention and violence to bring out flames. As I did the work no part of me doubted that the fire would come. It's just want happens next. It's proven fact, that this mixture of circumstances makes a fire. So no part of me doubted that within ten minutes I would be sipping hot coffee in a wool sweater. And no part of me doubted that fire would bring heat, and inspiration, and that washing wave of blessing for living this life on my own terms. It's a Wednesday morning and I am about to spend a day writing on my own farm! That was a fairytale through most of my twenties until I realized I was a furnace.You are a furnace, too.Here's what I want to share today: Don't focus on what you lack. Don't start your day with other people's accomplishments. Start your day knowing you are capable of making the life you desire. You need to see your own story as a pile of embers that just needs the work of kindling to explode into something wonderful. I live my life that way everyday. And when I am scared or anxious or worried about silly things -- I remember the certainty in which fire comes from hope and force. And as long as I am able to hold the coals of that metaphor close to my heart and ignite my own life's goals I can achieve anything. It requires being focused on the good of yourself, the good of others, and the bounty of this kind world. And it also means moving yourself out of a sense of victimhood and lacking and into one of power, a gift you can only give yourself. But once you start playing with fire, it's hard not to feel like anything is possible. The proof is here at this small farm and hundreds of others out there among you fine folks.You never have to worry about me. This farm will always be okay and only grow to be stronger, healthier, wiser and better equipped to help others find the same happiness if they want it. And I think the best thing I can do to make my fire burn a little brighter is remind you that you also have a hot coal in there somewhere. So choose to be happy, and it is a choice. Smile when you are cold, naked, and scared. Light the Need Fire of your own story, and share that heat with the rest of us. We sure as hell need it when the toilet bowl freezes...

              "128   (Related: 5 hazardous sunscreen mistakes you're making)You're in the market for a new sunscreen. You want one that works, so you do your homework — or try to. If you Google \"best sunscreen,\" the first link that appears is an Environmental Working Group list of products that meet its safety criteria. Look further and you'll see natural-health gurus proclaiming that many sunscreens are full of toxic ingredients like oxybenzone and retinyl palmitate, which could mess with your hormones or actually increase the risk of skin cancer. They advise sticking to mineral options with titanium dioxide or zinc oxide as the active ingredient. Yet others say even those formulas have the potential to be bad for you. What do you do now?Photo: Antonio Guillem/Getty ImagesFirst, know that sunscreen is necessary to protect your skin from the harmful effects of ultraviolet light, according to Mona Gohara, M.D., associate clinical professor of dermatology at the Yale School of Medicine. \"We know that 90 percent of skin cancers and 90 percent of the signs of aging come from ultraviolet light. That, we know for a fact. And the antidote to that is sunscreen,\" she says.The issue is that very few people are using sunscreen regularly (only 30 percent of women and 14 percent of men, per a recent study in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology), and those who do only use about half the recommended amount, according to separate research. And, sadly, people are still using tanning beds. To wit, rates of melanoma — the deadliest form of skin cancer — have doubled in the past 30 years, according to a recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Skin cancer and premature aging are both preventable, but still, adults skip sunscreen. \"People don't use it partially because they don't see the need for it,\" Dr. Gohara told the Cut. \"And some people just don't think it's good for them.\"Here, several myths about sunscreen and what's safest to use on your skin.MYTH: Oxybenzone should be avoided at all costs. There's conflicting information online about the safety of chemical blocks like oxybenzone, which absorb UV rays (as opposed to mineral blocks that reflect light). Fears that oxybenzone can penetrate the skin and act like estrogen in the body stem from a widely publicized 2001 study in which rats fed oxybenzone had enlarged uteruses after four days.Dr. Gohara says the dermatologic community takes issue with that piece of research since the rats were given \"megadoses\" of the chemical (1,500 milligrams per kilogram of body weight) and, as she explains, \"consuming something is quite different than putting it on your skin.\" A 2011 analysis published in JAMA Dermatology found it would take 200 years of daily sunscreen application to reach the level of oxybenzone exposure observed in the rat study.In response, scientists have tested topical application of sunscreen on actual people. A 2004 study had 32 participants apply a basic lotion every day for a week. The following week, they applied lotion containing 10 percent oxybenzone (even higher than the 6 percent permitted by the FDA) and the researchers found no difference in hormone levels that could be attributed to sunscreen. Yes, the participants had detectable levels of oxybenzone in their urine, but that's because your body excretes it that way.\"There's no evidence that these [ingredients] are carcinogenic,\" Dr. Gohara says. \"That being said, if somebody's not comfortable, they're simply not comfortable and that's fine. There are plenty of alternatives that don't have oxybenzone.\"MYTH: Retinyl palmitate increases skin-cancer risk. Animal research suggested that common inactive-ingredient retinyl palmitate (a form of vitamin A) could actually accelerate skin damage. But the study (which was conducted by the National Toxicology Program and never published in a peer-reviewed journal) was done on albino mice, which are more susceptible to skin cancer than humans. An analysis published in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology found there is no evidence that using retinyl palmitate in sunscreen raises cancer risk in humans.MYTH: Sunscreen is for the beach. Dr. Gohara says the average person gets the wrong idea from the name of the product alone. \"It shouldn't be called 'sunscreen,' it should be 'ultraviolet screen,'\" she says. \"'Sunscreen' connotes that you should only be wearing it when you're in the sun.\" UV light is present even on cloudy or rainy days, she says. \"What we see in skin-cancer patients and people who are aging prematurely is that either they don't protect themselves or they only protect themselves in the sun,\" she told the Cut. \"Ultraviolet light is around all the time, whether you're driving, or whatever.\"MYTH: SPF 100 blocks 100 percent of UV rays. That isn't how it works. In fact, no sunscreen blocks all UV rays, and SPF ratings refer only to protection against UVB, not UVA, rays (more on that below). The difference in protection is smaller than the ratings suggest: SPF 15 blocks 93 percent of UVB rays, SPF 30 filters 97 percent, SPF 50 blocks 98 percent, and SPF 100 blocks 99 percent. But only for up to two hours. You need to reapply that often — or sooner after swimming or sweating excessively — because the product wears off.The American Academy of Dermatology recommends using broad-spectrum SPF 30 or higher, though the Environmental Working Group argues that SPF values greater than 50 could lead to a false sense of security. The FDA is aware of this issue: The agency proposed a regulation stating that products over 50 be labeled 50+, but it's still under review.One sunscreen regulation that's already in effect is that \"broad-spectrum\" label: Only products that pass the FDA's test proving they block both UVA (aging) and UVB (burning) rays can make such a claim, which is good to know because exposure to both kinds can increase skin-cancer risk.MYTH: People of color don't need it. Kerry Washington has been trying to spread the word about this belief as part of her role as a Neutrogena spokesperson. \"There have been a lot of misconceptions, particularly in communities of color, that because you have melanin in your skin, you don't need to protect it,\" she said in a recent interview with the Huffington Post.Darker skin (or even tanned skin) might have more melanin in it than fair skin, but the protective effect is minimal: Experts say black skin likely has a max SPF of 4. And while skin cancer is less common in people of color, the average five-year survival rate for melanoma is lower among African-Americans (75 percent) than it is for Caucasians (93 percent). It might be because doctors aren't catching it in time: One study found that late-stage melanoma diagnoses were more common in people of color than in white patients.MYTH: Sprays are worthless. They do work, you just need to hold the bottle a few inches from your skin, and rub it in so you don't miss any spots. The exception is your face: The AAD recommends spraying the product into your hands and then applying it in order to avoid inhaling any fumes or particles. The FDA is investigating the safety of spray products but hasn't made any rulings.So what should you do?Use sunscreen and lots of it. The best thing to do is apply your broad-spectrum formula of choice before getting dressed, and 30 minutes before going outside. Stand in front of a full-length mirror and put that stuff everywhere, including your ears, hairline, the back of your neck, tops of your feet, and backs of your knees. Experts say that using less than the recommended one ounce (or two tablespoons) over your entire body drastically reduces your protection, though you might think you're safe to stay outside. Reapply using the same amount every two hours.And think beyond sprays and lotions: \"It's not just about the sunscreen, it's about sunglasses, sun-protective clothing, and avoiding the sun during peak hours. Sun protection and skin-cancer prevention really is a lifestyle,\" she says. \"It's like if you have heart disease, you don't just lay off the doughnuts — you have to exercise, you have to do a lot of stuff.\" Click through for great sunscreens to choose from this summer:

              "132   Subway was reeling from declining sales before its spokeman Jared Fogle was charged with child pornography, reports Kaja Whitehouse Robert Deutsch, USA TODAYThe troubles surrounding Subway's longtime spokesman Jared Fogle couldn't have come at a worse time for the sandwich maker.After a meteoric rise to become one of the nation's largest fast-food chains, Subway has been suffering from falling sales and declining customer satisfaction amid increased competition. Last year, for the first time ever, it lost its long-held spot as the nation's second-largest restaurant chain by sales to Starbucks, according to research firm Technomic. And now the brand's most public face has been tarnished by criminal charges.Fogle appeared in court Wednesday on charges of traveling for sex with minors, and for receiving and distributing child pornography.\"Jared Fogle is agreeing to plead guilty to the charges filed against him today,\" said Fogle's attorney Jeremy Margolis in a statement.Fogle, famous for losing about 245 pounds on a diet of Subway sandwiches in college, also crossed state lines to pay for sex with minors, prosecutors said.\"We no longer have a relationship with Jared and have no further comment,\" Subway wrote in a tweet Tuesday.The scandal comes ahead of Subway's 50th anniversary next week and as the chain seeks to beat back rising competition from fast-food sandwich makers, like Chick-fil-A, as well as fast-casual restaurants like Chipotle. The competition resulted in a 3.3% sales decline at Subway last year, to $11.9 billion from $12.3 billion in 2013 — marking the largest loss across the restaurant chain industry, as tracked by Technomic.The sales drop pushed Subway from the nation's No. 2 largest restaurant as measured by sales to the No. 3 slot, according to Technomic's 2015 Top 500 Chain report out in March. Starbucks stole the No. 2 slot. McDonald's remains No. 1.Whether Jared's tarnished reputation will affect sales this year remains to be seen, but experts say it can't help.\"They've already been struggling, and with what we have seen with the negative publicity around Jared, I think that isn't going to help,\" says Darren Tristano, executive vice president with Technomic. \"It very likely is going to have some negative impact.\"Subway's ascent to the top was boosted by its early image as a healthy fast-food option, spurred in good part by the slimmed-down Fogle, who began starring in ads for the company about 15 years ago. The sandwich shop became the nation's fourth-largest restaurant chain by sales in 2007 and then jumped past Wendy's and Burger King in 2008 to take the No. 2 slot, according to Technomic data.But along with other large fast-food chains, Subway has been losing traction with customers who are increasingly enamored with newer chains that boast fresh, natural or local ingredients. According to the American Customer Satisfaction Index, as of June Subway's customer satisfaction rating has fallen 6.1% since 2012, the first year ACSI started tracking the chain.Subway may have been offering customers the \"build-your-own\" meal model and an assortment of vegetables long before chains like Chipotle and Chop't, but established chains have lost some allure, said ACSI's June 2015 Restaurant Report.\"As the economy improves, consumers with more disposable income — but squeezed for time — want higher-quality ingredients, freshness and better service at a reasonable price. They also are willing to pay a bit more,\" the report said.Plus, consumers' hankering for a sub sandwich has started to fade. Traffic to submarine sandwich shops — including chains like Subway and Quiznos — was down 4% in the 12 months ended in June, with 95 million fewer visits than the year before, according to market research company NPD Group.While Subway has traditionally been viewed as a healthier option in terms of having fewer calories than many mainstream fast-food options, consumers don't put as much stock in calorie counts anymore compared to other health attributes, said Molly Harnischfeger, a director in the restaurant and food services practice at consulting firm AlixPartners.She said consumers are more focused on \"local ingredients, food with integrity, having fresh produce. Those are the types of things that consumers are demanding of companies now. It's not just about calories.\"Also, what consumers consider good value is no longer just about low prices. Most consumers define value as quality of ingredients for the price, according to a report from AlixPartners. Bundled offerings, large portion sizes and lowest prices have become less important over the last year, the report said.Technomic's Tristano attributes Subway's woes in part to the rising cost of its famous $5 Footlong, a 12-inch sandwich that ran into trouble in 2013 for being under the 12 inches advertised by its name.The higher price of the footlong forced people seeking cheap, healthy meals to look elsewhere, Tristano says.Contributing: The Indianapolis StarRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1LlrDxj

              "134   Something rare and potentially very dangerous is happening in the market right now. And if history is any indication, it could spell short-term pain.The S&P 500 has closed above its five-day moving average for 20 consecutive days. That has only happened just three times before in the last two decades.Now, here’s the sad part: Four weeks after each of one those streaks came to an end, the S&P 500 was down, for an average loss of 3 percent. That’s according to a recent study by Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at MKM Partners.What’s more, the S&P 500 has had just seven prior streaks above its five-day moving average lasting 18 days or more. And those, too, also averaged losses four and six weeks after ending.(Watch: Wal-Mart helps lift Dow industrials to record finish)Does that mean there will be bad news for stocks soon?“The last time we saw a decline like we saw in October, which was about 9 percent, was back in September to November 2012,” Krinsky said. “To recover 12 percent off the lows took 49 trading days. We just rallied 12 percent off the lows in 19 trading days. So the ascent of the rally has been rather remarkable.”(Read: Asian markets seen higher on Wall Street lead; oil in focus)And because the five-day moving average is such a short-term indicator, the fact that the S&P 500 has remained above it for four weeks makes the rally so remarkable and unusual, he said.But with Thursday’s close at 2,039.33, the S&P 500 is extremely close to hitting an important level, according to Krinsky. “We’re pushing against a pretty good area of resistance around 2,040,” he said.If that resistance holds, heforesees the index returning towardan area between 1,970 and 1,980, roughly 3 percent lower from current prices.That’s not enough to worry Krinsky, however. “Nothing too concerning,” he said. “But risk/reward from this level seems to favor the downside.”

              "2832  Blake and MirandaBlake Shelton and Miranda Lambert are in the news again this week with rumors of an imminent split. On Nov. 13, The National Enquirer reported that the country stars are on the outs again, this time following Blake's recent interview on 60 Minutes. During the interview, Blake was extremely candid, and even admitted to falling in love with Miranda while he was married to his first wife (which actually isn't new information).\"Miranda is fuming and embarrassed over Blake’s airing of their dirty laundry, and she blasted him for confessing he cheated on his then-wife with her,\" said a source. \"Blake finally confirmed what everyone has always suspected!\"Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert's marriage is apparently doomed according to their recent body language too. The two have walked red carpets together, and posed for photos wearing big smiles, but sources say that it's all an act.\"While both sport million-dollar smiles, their body language is a far more accurate barometer of their inner feelings. While it is subtle, it is noticeable in the photos that they are not leaning in toward each other, as they usually do. This is a common indicator of couples facing relationship challenges,\" said Wendy Patrick, co-author of Reading People.Divorce rumors peeked earlier this month when Miranda accepted two awards at the CMA's, but neglected to thank Blake. He, however, thanked her while accepting his award. Then there was the whole \"once a cheater, always a cheater\" thing, and people just don't trust Blake.If Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert don't split before the holidays, that won't really be surprising. The two have denied all the crazy break-up rumors in the past, and may not even be having any real problems... but who knows? The Epoch Times reports that things are so bad, the two are doing whatever they can to salvage what they have left. Oh, and there's that whole baby thing. Apparently Miranda wants a baby... but Blake doesn't. What do you make of the rumors?

              "2835  (DVIDSHUB/Flickr) Stocks climbed well off the lows of the day after minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting leaked. The Dow lost more than 200 points in early trade, rallied after the minutes, and retreated again in the late afternoon. Crude oil sank to a fresh six-year low, while gold climbed to a four-week high. First, the scoreboard:Dow: 17,348.73, -162.61, (-0.93%) S&P 500: 2,079.61, -17.31, (-0.83%) Nasdaq: 5,019.05, -40.30, (-0.80%)And now, the top stories on Wednesday:We got the minutes of the Federal Reserve's July meeting earlier than we should have. Bloomberg published a headline around 1:36 p.m. ET on the terminal that said \"most Fed officials in July saw conditions for [a] rate rise nearing.\" In a statement, the company said it \"inadvertently sent a headline ahead of the embargo\", which was to be lifted at 2:00 p.m. This is the second Fed-related leak within a month. In late July, the Fed disclosed that its staff economic projections had been accidentally published on its website. The minutes showed that one FOMC member was willing to raise rates last month, but others felt the economic pre-conditions had not been met. Most members thought the labor market was very close to maximum employment. They lowered their outlook for inflation following the downturn in energy prices. And, China came up: \"Several participants noted that a material slowdown in Chinese economic activity could pose risks to the U.S. economic outlook.\" Inflation was tepid in July. The consumer price index came in at 0.1% month-over-month (0.2% estimated), and 0.1% on a 'core' basis excluding volatile food and energy costs (0.2% expected). A 5.6% plunge in airline tickets – the biggest in nearly 20 years - weighed down the index. The energy index climbed 0.1%, as higher gas prices offset declines in other energy components. And, shelter inflation, or housing prices, continued to soar as they have, in contrast to the overall trend. Crude oil fell to a new six-year low. West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures in New York plunged more than 4% to as low as $40.97 in New York. Data from the Energy Information Administration showed that oil inventories unexpectedly climbed by 2.6 million barrels last week. Inventories are still at a level not seen at this time of year for the past 80 years. Chinese stocks had a wild day, rebounding to the green after the benchmark Shanghai Composite fell more than 5% in early trade. There had been speculation that the People's Bank of China may cut the reserve-ratio requirements for banks by 50 basis points this weekend. DON'T MISS: TRADER: Prepare for 'the most bullish event for

              "2851  While Iran and North Korea’s nuclear programs are all the rage these days, the most dangerous nuclear threat facing the world continues to go largely unnoticed.Namely, China and India are both on the cusp of deploying multiple independently targetable reentry (MIRV) vehicles on their ballistic missiles, a development that is likely to have profound, far-reaching consequences for the region and beyond.MIRVed missiles carry payloads of several nuclear warheads each capable of being directed at a different set of targets. They are considered extremely destabilizing to the strategic balance primarily because they place a premium on striking first and create a “use em or lose em” nuclear mentality.Along with being less vulnerable to anti-ballistic missile systems, this is true for two primary reasons. First, and most obviously, a single MIRVed missile can be used to eliminate numerous enemy nuclear sites simultaneously. Thus, theoretically at least, only a small portion of an adversary’s missile force would be necessary to completely eliminate one’s strategic deterrent. Secondly, MIRVed missiles enable countries to use cross-targeting techniques of employing two or more missiles against a single target, which increases the kill probability.In other words, MIRVs are extremely destabilizing because they make adversary’s nuclear arsenals vulnerable to being wiped out in a surprise first strike. To compensate for this fact, states must come up with innovative ways to secure their deterrent from an enemy first strike. This usually entails increasing the size of one’s arsenal, and further dispersing to make it more difficult for an enemy to conduct a successful first strike. For example, when the U.S. first deployed MIRVed missiles in 1968, the Soviet Union had less than 10,000 nuclear warheads. A decade later, however, it had over 25,000 (of course, the Soviet Union deploying its own MIRVed missiles incentivized expanding the size of its arsenal since more warheads were needed per missile).With regards to China and India, then, the introduction of MIRVed missiles could have profound consequences of both of their nuclear postures. One of the most remarkable aspects of every nuclear state not named Russia or the United States is they have relied on an extremely small nuclear arsenal to meet their deterrent needs. This is especially true of India and China who have generally maintained minimum deterrence and no-first use doctrines. With the introduction of countervailing MIRVed missiles, however, there will be strong incentives on both sides to vastly increase the size of their arsenals if any to guard against the threat of a first strike by the other side.Of course, the consequences of China and India acquiring MIRVed missiles would not be limited to those states alone. Most obviously, India’s acquisition of MIRVed missiles would immediately threaten the survivability of Pakistan’s nuclear forces. In the short-term, this will probably result in Islamabad further dispersing its nuclear arsenal, which in general will leave it more vulnerable to Islamist terrorist groups in the country. Over the long-term, Pakistan will feel pressure to expand the size of its arsenal as well as acquire MIRVed capabilities of its own.The same pressures will be felt in Moscow. Since the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Russia has relied on its vast nuclear arsenal to compensate for its relative conventional weakness. In the eyes of Russian leaders, this will only grow more necessary as China continues to modernize its conventional military forces. Currently, Russia holds vastly more nuclear warheads than China, which is a source of relief for Moscow. As China MIRVs its missiles, however, as well as likely builds up the size of its arsenal, Moscow will see its nuclear superiority over Beijing rapidly erode. It can be counted on to respond by abrogating its arms control treaties with the United States, and expanding its own arsenal as well. In such a situation, a U.S. president would come under enormous domestic pressure to meet Russia’s buildup warhead for warhead.Thus, while the prospect of North Korea and Iran acquiring operationalized nuclear arsenals may be concerning, China and India’s MIRVed missiles present far greater threats to the world.Zachary Keck is the managing editor of The National Interest.

              "2859  Photo Credit: iStockBy Debra MacleodI can’t tell you how many unhappy husbands I’ve seen in my office over the past decade or so. They present with all kinds of issues—from infidelity, to in-law troubles, and everything in between.Yet, despite the variety of marriage problems that can arise, there are some complaints that are so prevalent and common that they warrant being singled out.Related: Feeling Hopeless? Here’s How To Save Your MarriageBelow are eight of the most common complaints that unhappy husbands make about their wives. Read them. Believe them. Stop them:1. You’re a grump.When you speak to your husband, your voice tone is full of negativity, contempt and criticism. If he tries to express a concern or complaint about the marriage, you rise up in angry defensiveness and throw the blame back on him instead of hearing him out.2. You’re a nag.If your husband has a free moment, you pounce on him and order him to fix something around the house. If he goes out with friends, you text him incessantly, asking when he’ll be home. Basically, you’re a matrimonial version of the micro-managing boss.3. You’re a cold fish in bed.If he flashes you a flirtatious wink, you roll your eyes. If he reaches for you in bed, you turn your back to him. On those rare occasions you do give in and have sex, you lie there and stare at the ceiling, waiting for it to be over and sapping all the fun out of it.4. You’re a frump.Whether you’ve stopped exercising or started wearing sweatpants, you’ve let yourself go and lost your energy and enthusiasm for life. To be honest, this isn’t a top complaint that I hear from men; however, a woman who feels unattractive often withdraws—emotionally and physically—from her marriage. And that is something that husbands do complain about.Related: 50 of the Best Marriage Tips EVER5. You’re a “Mommy,” and nothing else.You get way more excited about a “Mommy & Me” playdate than a romantic evening with your husband. Just keep in mind that a child-centered marriage isn’t a marriage at all; it’s just a daycare.6. You’re an alpha parent.As the leader of the parenting pack, you snap at your husband every time he tries to be a dad or parent his children in the way he sees fit. As a result, you rob your children of a father’s care and discipline, and you drive a wedge between you and your husband.7. You’re thankless.Whether your husband has put in major overtime at work or spent his entire long-weekend building you that backyard deck you want, you take his efforts for granted and fail to show appreciation for anything he does for you or your family.8. You’re (yawn) boring.You don’t have any interests or hobbies outside the marriage or home (no, Facebook isn’t a hobby). That makes you predictable and bland company who never has anything interesting to add to a conversation. You should get a life, to put it plainly.If you’re worried that the passion in your marriage is starting to subside, don’t panic. Instead, take a good, hard look at your own behavior. How can you bring more positivity and romance into your marriage? How can you make your husband feel more appreciated and desired? How can you build him up as a loving, competent parent? How can you make him happy?

And those things, according to the National Enquirer, via Radar Online, are to not leave crumbs everywhere.The site claims that the Clooney has picked up a nasty habit (probably from all those years of reigning as the world's most eligible bachelor) and that now he just can't stop munching at bedtime.\"Like lots of guys, George loves munching tasty treats at bedtime,\" a source revealed to the publication. \"But he's whining to pals that Amal's acting downright appalled by what she calls his 'nasty habit.'\"And according to the source, Clooney has now resorted to hiding his snacks around the house, including in bathroom cupboards and closets. Um, what?OK, if these reports are to be believed, these two haven't been married long, so there are probably loads of things that they are still learning about each other, and your husband's bad bedtime habits may just be one of them. However, if this is as bad as it gets, well, that's not too bad then, is it? I mean, there are much worse things to deal with than crumbs in the bed, and c'mon — have you seen how hot Clooney is?Tell us what you think: Could you put up with crumbs in your bed?

              "2864  Ellen DeGeneres shocked her talk show audience when she seemingly caught Leah Remini’s husband cheating on her on air.Ellen discovered the “affair” when she decided to give Leah’s husband, Angelo Pagan, a ring during the show. DeGeneres explained to the audience that she and Remini were going to prank call Pagan to get revenge for a prank he had recently played on his wife. According to Leah, Angelo was on a business trip and staying in a hotel (bet you can see where this going).Leah proved to be a terrible prank caller — her brilliant plan was for Ellen to ask Angelo random questions about his hotel in a silly voice. However, things got interesting when Angelo didn’t pick up the phone. Instead the audience heard a woman’s voice, and Remini grabbed the phone from DeGeneres while shouting an expletive.“What the f***! Who is this?” she asked.“This is Tiffany. Who’s this?” the woman responded.Leah informed Tiffany that she was Angelo’s wife, and Tiffany could be heard questioning Angelo in the background.“You’re married?” she asked.You can check out the exchange below. As you can see, the prank call actually ends up being a prank on The Ellen DeGeneres Show viewers — the audience’s awkward silence is soon broken by the sound of bells, and DeGeneres and Remini start to giggle.According to the Mirror, some Ellen Show viewers didn’t get the joke. Leah Remini later took to Twitter to inform her worried fans that Angelo Pagan isn’t cheating on her. She explained that the “affair” discovery was just a set-up to surprise her lucky audience with gifts worth hundreds of dollars.Regarding the Ellen show today; it was just a joke to throw the audience off to surprise them with the gifts! Me and @apangelo are good! — Leah Remini (@LeahRemini) December 17, 2014At least Leah Remini was in on the cheating stunt. As Nicki Minaj recently found out, sometimes Ellen prefers to amuse her audience by pranking her unsuspecting guests.Ellen DeGeneres might as well change her name to Ellen Be-Generous during the holidays — she’s one of the most giving talk show hosts when it comes to the free stuff that her audience members get. Each year she celebrates “12 Days of Giveaways” by giving her studio audience fantastic freebies like gift cards and electronics.Ellen DeGeneres is such a giver that she even brought her generosity to the Conan audience. According to the Hollywood Reporter, DeGeneres made a surprise appearance on Conan O’Brien’s late night show, and she chastised O’Brien for not giving away enough free stuff to his audience. You can see how she makes up for Conan’s Grinch-iness in the video below.Ellen DeGeneres might not be the best prankster, but she sure is good at playing Santa Claus (who wouldn’t want a pair of Jon Hamm’s used basketball shorts?).

              "2866  A man from Kosovo believes he is the reincarnation of Adolf Hitler, the Nazi dictator to whom he bears a striking, eerie resemblance.Emin Djinovci, a 49-year-old Kosovan from Mitrovica, sports a jet black mustache and slicks his hair to one side, according the the Daily Mail. Traveling everywhere with a copy of Mein Kampf, Hitler’s manifesto, Djinovci earns his living as a Hitler look-alike, charging tourists roughly $90 for a photograph.Billing himself as Kosovo’s reincarnation of Adolf Hitler, Djinovci originates from Germany, which he left in 1998 in order to fight for secession from Serbia. He asserts that in this cause, he finds common ground with the real Adolf Hitler.“I am proud of my likeness to the Fuhrer because, like him, I fought against the Serbs – my enemies,” he said in an interview with InSerbia News. “It is easy. I find myself in Hitler’s character because he fought against my enemy. Enemy of my enemy is my friend. Yes, Serbs are my enemies.”Djinovci has five daughters, whom he calls “Hitler’s children.” As Metro notes, he would face arrest in Germany for the same actions, as glorifying Hitler or the Nazi regime is considered a serious crime, and prohibited by law. Local business leaders in Kosovo, however, reportedly have little problem with Djinovci’s method of earning a living, pointing out that it shows “great enterprise.”Earlier this month, a reminder of Hitler’s brutal regime was discovered in Brazil, as police noted a swastika emblazoned upon the bottom of a swimming pool. Flying overhead as part of an unrelated investigation, the officers were stunned to notice the Nazi symbol, which as the Inquisitr reported, had been in place for 13 years. As the swastika and pool reside on private property, officials were unable to file charges against the owner.Hitler ordered German forces to invade Yugoslavia and Greece in April of 1941. During that time, the majority of the Yugoslavian population consisted of Serbs and Croats. During the course of the Second World War, Serbs were widely persecuted by the occupying Axis forces.Though he is remembered as the leader of Germany’s Nazi party, Adolf Hitler was actually born in Austria.[Image: YouTube/ new scene 2014 via the Daily Mail]

              "2868  Whether you try to hide it or not, you fart. Everybody does.But even though it's such a routine activity — the average person farts between 10 and 20 times per day — there's a lot about farting that you might not know.As part of research into the microbiome — the rich community of bacteria that live throughout your body — scientists have learned all sorts of interesting things about the bacteria that produce gas inside your intestines. Here are 9 crucial things to know about flatulence.1) You produce about 500 to 1500 milliliters of gas per day, and expel it in 10 to 20 fartsThis might be more than you'd expect, but it's been measured in controlled studies. The surprisingly hefty amount is the result of bacteria that live in your colon and feed on most of the food you eat, says Purna Kashyap — a gastroenterologist at the Mayo Clinic who studies the gut microbiome.\"There are a lot of carbohydrates that we consume — mainly present in vegetables, grains, and fruits — that our bodies don't have the enzymes necessary to digest,\" he says. \"These end up in large intestine, where microbes chew them apart and use them for energy, through the process of fermentation. As a byproduct, they produce gas.\"A huge variety of foods contain these complex carbs that we can't fully digest: virtually all beans, most vegetables, and anything with whole grains. For most people, this leads to somewhere between 500 to 1500 milliliters of gas daily — the equivalent of half a two-liter bottle of soda, every single day.2) 99 percent of the gas you produce does not smellOne of the reasons that we produce so much more gas than we realize is that nearly all of it is odorless.Hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane make up as much as 99 percent of the gas produced in our large intestines by volume. (They're supplemented by air you swallow — more on that below.) All of these gases are odorless, which is why much of the time, farts don't actually smell at all.The potent stink, research has found, is largely due to the 1 percent or so of compounds with sulfur in them, such as hydrogen sulfide. (This sort of research itself is pretty amazing: one experiment involved two people judging the smelliness of farts of 16 participants who'd been fed pinto beans, collected with the aid of \"gas-tight Mylar pantaloons.\")Caution: these contain sulfur. (Shutterstock.com)Bacteria need to consume sulfur to produce sulfurous gases, and though not all foods with complex carbs contain sulfur, many do. They're mainly foods that you probably already associate with farting — things like beans, onions, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, and dairy.3) Gum and soda can make you fart more(Shutterstock.com)Apart from the gases produced by bacteria, a significant proportion of your flatulence is simply made up of inadvertently swallowed air. It doesn't smell — it's mostly nitrogen and oxygen — but it sounds and feels the same coming out.Some of this swallowing goes on while you're asleep, but it can be increased by drinking carbonated beverages (after all, you're ingesting the carbonation) and by chewing gum.4) Farting is the result of a healthy, complex ecosystem in your intestinesBacteroides fragilis, one of the bacteria species involved in gas production, cultured in a petri dish. (Nathan Reading)Modern society views flatulence as a negative. This is unfortunate, because in most cases, it's the byproduct of a beautiful thing — the intricate ecosystem of bacteria living in your intestines.\"It's a complex ecology, with various organisms coexisting and thriving,\" Kashyap says. \"When a complex carbohydrate reaches your colon, some bacteria will break it down first, and then some of their byproducts will feed other bacteria. The whole community benefits from a single carbohydrate that you consume.\"What's more, you also benefit. Scientists are still unraveling the role of the microbiome in digestion, but it's known that the same bacteria that produce gas also generate vitamins and fatty acids that help maintain our colon lining, and may support our immune systems.5) There's a simple reason why you don't mind the smell of your own fartsAs this AsapScience video explains, experiments have confirmed that we find the smell of our own farts less offensive than others'.The reason: we become habituated to all smells over time. That's why you might notice a scent walking into a stranger's house, but seldom do for your own.It's also why you become habituated to the characteristic mix of odors produced by the bacteria inside your own body, which differs slightly from everyone else's. As a result, your own farts just don't have the same impact on you — even though they're just as pungent for everyone else.6) Yes, you can light a fart on fireBecause flatulence is partly composed of flammable gases like methane and hydrogen, it can be briefly set on fire.We don't recommend it, because of the risk of injury, but if you have to see it, there are plenty of examples here.7) No, you can't hold a fart in until it disappears(Shutterstock.com)This might seem obvious, but for whatever reason, people wonder about this question. At times, after holding in a fart for a while for social reasons, it can seem to disappear.However, this isn't actually possible. It might seem to vanish because you stop being conscious of it, and it leaks out gradually, but the physics of flatulence are pretty straightforward. A fart is a bubble of gas, and there's ultimately nowhere for it to go besides out of your anus.8) Beano cuts down on gas production by starving these bacteriaIn case you're wondering, the over-the-counter product Beano — which claims to \"prevent gas before it occurs\" — actually works as advertised. Two different controlled trials have found that it significantly reduces gas production in the hours following a bean-filled meal.The way it works is pretty simple: the pills contain an enzyme called alpha-galactosidase that cuts complex carbohydrates into shorter, simpler carbs that are much easier to digest. As a result, they get broken down in your small intestine, rather than making it all the way to the large intestine, where bacteria would ferment them, producing gas.However, there's a drawback to habitually taking Beano to prevent gas.9) Starving your fart-producing bacteria is not a good ideaBacteroides fragilis, one of the bacteria species involved in gas production. (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)For most people, actively trying to limit your gas production isn't necessary, Kaskyap says. The amount you produce is the result of both your balance of gut bacteria and diet, and unless you're experiencing other sorts of problems — such as painful bloating — it's not wise to mess with it.\"The knee-jerk reaction, for many people, is to stop eating things that produce gas,\" he says. \"But these foods, which have complex carbohydrates, are nutrition for the bacteria in our gut. You don't want to starve them unless there's a good reason.\"Additionally, he notes, many people who believe they suffer from excessive gas production actually just have trouble with the flow of that gas through their intestines, perhaps due to constipation. Or, they might make the same amount of gas but emit it more frequently, in smaller doses. In either case, Kashyap says, \"by changing your diet, you're not solving the problem and may in fact be harming yourself.\"Of course, there are exceptions here: if you produce truly excessive amounts of gas or experience painful bloating, it could be a sign of a problem — such as lactose intolerance — and you may want to see a doctor.Further reading: How bacteria in your gut could be making you

              "2871  Just days after \"Roker-thon,\" where Roker broke the Guinness World Record for the longest weather broadcast, NBC weatherman Al Roker found himself in the middle of a \"Roker-vention.\"Page Six is reporting that the iconic \"Today Show\" weatherman has been ordered to think before he speaks after a series of cringe-worthy comments -- including a moment when he told a woman her husband looked like he could be her dad. Roker said he got some bad information, but he still made the moment a tad more awkward than necessary.A source told the paper that Roker was summoned into a meeting with NBC executives and told to take it down a notch.The source said, \"He was saying weird things and becoming too idiosyncratic. They asked him to act more like a traditional weatherman.\"Just last month, he told a mother her crying infant looked like a \"Japanese anime.\" And who could forget that incredibly awkward moment back in 2012, shortly after it was rumored Matt Lauer had fellow \"Today\" anchor Ann Curry fired?The Olympic rowers being interviewed were explaining their tradition of throwing a teammate into the water when Roker interrupted with, \"Which is different than our tradition, which is to throw one of us under the bus. But that's another story.\"It's said that Roker took the criticism in stride and is playing ball with NBC executives. He probably doesn't have much of a choice unless he wants to be the latest \"Today Show\" casualty.Just this week, NBC brass fired their new exec Jamie Horowitz after just three months on the job.How do you feel about Al Roker being asked to tone it down? Would the show be as fun without Roker's funny asides and unexpected jokes?

              "2876  In what can only be described as a weird story, Arsenal FC Forward Alexis Sanchez reportedly dumped his girlfriend, Laia Grassi. Break ups happen, especially in the sports world. Travel and time away can drive couples apart. Sometimes you just aren’t right for one another, or you simply grow apart. However, this was not the case with Alexis Sanchez.According to Sanchez’s hometown newspaper, La Cuarta, Alexis broke up with Grassi over issues in the bedroom.An original report had the two breaking up due to Sanchez failing to take the former Miss Chile out for dinner shortly after the World Cup, however, that seemed to not be the case.Alexis Sanchez really wanted to perform well for his new club, so he could not provide what Grassi needed in the bedroom. Apparently, he was saving his energy for the games upcoming. So basically, he broke up with her over the simple fact that he couldn’t have sex with her, says the La Cuarta.Obviously, the commitment to his new club is cool to see. Not many have the dedication to totally give up bedroom needs in order to perform the best they possibly can on the field. Especially when that someone in the bedroom is Laia Grassi, a literal Beauty Queen.Alexis Sanchez is new to Arsenal, which is one of the better football clubs in the world. Obviously, he wants to impress and show that he is as good as any other on the team. The issue with the La Cuarta report is that the same paper claimed not too long ago that Sanchez was under-performing for Arsenal due to having too much sex. That being said, everything could be linked.Could the manager have spoken to Sanchez, telling him to calm it down due to under-performing? Was he not giving himself to his girlfriend because of this reason? It certainly would lead to a break up.Since the break up, Alexis Sanchez has been removed from Grassi’s Instagram account, which many took as an official announcement about the break up. However, at the end of the day, you don’t hear many stories like this. After all, most men would kill to have Sanchez’s life. Regardless, let’s see if the new focus on his game will lead to bigger and better things for Alexis and his club.[IMG Credit: pixgood.com]

              "2885  CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (MarketWatch) — Investors who are giving the bull market in stocks the benefit of the doubt are playing with fire. That’s because the bear market’s warning signals have created a situation as vulnerable to the slightest spark as a parched desert.The latest warning comes from the so-called High-Low Logic Index. That well-regarded indicator was created by Norman Fosback in 1979, then the president of the Institute for Econometric Research, and currently editor of Fosback’s Fund Forecaster. The index represents the lesser of two numbers from the New York Stock Exchange: new 52-week highs and new 52-week lows (both expressed as a percentage of total issues traded).The indicator, therefore, is a measure of internal market divergences. In his investment textbook “Stock Market Logic,” Fosback reasoned: “Under normal conditions, either a substantial number of stocks establish new annual highs or a large number set new lows — but not both. ... A healthy market requires some semblance of internal uniformity.”By this measure, the current stock market is anything but healthy. The 10-week moving average of weekly readings recently rose to 5.7%, well above the level that many researchers use as the threshold for a “sell” signal. (Fosback, for example, set this threshold at 5%, considering readings above that level as evidence of “extreme market divergence and ... bearish.” The threshold employed by Ned Davis Research, the Venice, Florida-based research firm, is 4.4%.)Why hasn’t this dangerously lofty level of the High Low Logic Index received more attention? There are at least two reasons.The first: The index has a better track record over longer, rather than shorter, spans, and its signals can be premature. Prior to the 2007-2009 bear market, for example, which began in October, the High Low Logic Index breached the 5 threshold in late July. So it’s possible that some of the bulls are worried about the High Low Logic Index but are waiting for confirmation from other indicators before pulling some of their chips off the table.The other reason that some are ignoring these latest warnings is that the index gave a number of false signals in 2013. As you can see from the accompanying chart, in fact, it rose to near 6 in the summer of 2013. (I wrote a column reporting its dangerously high level in August of that year.) Needless to say, the bull market didn’t soon come to an end.You’ll also notice from the chart that the High Low Logic Index rose to an even higher level at the end of last year — hitting 6.9 in late December. It’s too early to know whether that, too, will prove to be a false signal, though I would note that the Dow Jones Industrial Average is lower today than it was then.One adviser who is particularly worried about the message of the High Low Logic Index is Doug Ramsey, Chief Investment Officer of The Leuthold Group. He points out that, unlike the situation that prevailed on the occasion of those false signals a couple of years ago, this time around there also is extreme divergence in the Nasdaq market, in particular.In fact, Ramsey reports that a Nasdaq-only version of the High Low Logic Index just rose above its “sell” threshold for the first time since 2007. I need not remind you what happened at that time.Click here to inquire about subscriptions to the Hulbert Sentiment Indexes.

              "2886  ITV will be slightly peeved that X Factor hunk Jake Quickenden lost out to veteran motorbike champ Carl Fogarty.After all, it was no accident that he was dropped in to the jungle after the departure of Craig Charles and Gemma Collins.With the stars from the channel’s stellar shows Coronation Street and TOWIE gone, ITV needed someone to represent it and Simon Cowell’s ratings’ behemoth on their biggest programme of the year.Scroll down for video  ITV will be peeved X Factor hunk Jake Quickenden lost out to veteran motorbike champ Carl 'Foggy' Fogarty, although his resemblance to Catweazle could be handy if it's planning a re-makeThe strong favourite since the self-inflicted demise of Jimmy Bullard, Jake ticked all the boxes to go on and be crowned King of The Jungle: handsome, engaging, sweet natured, and safe: pretty and vacant. (Not only had he never heard of Edwina Currie, he beamed proudly ‘I don’t even know what politics is.’)Carl Fogarty on the other hand was a more wizened, slightly jaundiced, old soul. Witness the early episodes when he had no qualms about resisting the idea of feeding the starving camp mates he had left behind in Jungle Jail, declaring bluntly: ‘wherever I go, the food goes.’ As he said he wasn’t really a team player. He also bore a distracting, disturbing resemblance to Catweazle.No doubt Jake will still go on to reap all the rewards he would have if he had won: plenty of appearances on daytime television, some celebrity cooking, a Christmas record, and eventually, some adverts for Iceland.Still, it will (if you’ll pardon the pun) bug him, ITV, and Simon Cowell that he didn’t win.As to why Carl Fogarty won, it principally came down to final day’s trials.The ordeal suffered by the strongest female candidate, Mel Sykes (searching for stars in cloudy water with a few eels etc) may have been popular with male viewers – nothing short of a wet t-shirt contest – but wasn’t daring or terrifying enough to carry her home, despite her claims about how much she hated going underwater.Jake Quickenden’s trial involved the helmet full of creepy crawlies.I'm sure Fogarty won a lot of last-minute votes because he was the celebrity undergoing the eating trialYou could see how much winning meant to the former Superbike champion. The voters obviously figured he deserved itNo doubt Jake will still go on to reap all the rewards he would have if he had won: plenty of appearances on daytime television, some celebrity cooking, a Christmas record, and eventually, some adverts for Iceland‘I always wanted to be an astronaut !’ he smiled, not entirely joking.Obviously, having 1500 cockroaches, 1500 crickets, 10 ‘burrowing cockroaches’, and 200 soldier crabs crawling around your head wasn’t fun, but most of them were scrambling up the sides to get and, asides from the odd nibble, Jake survived relatively painlessly. None of the little critters did what is known on the show as ‘a Fatima Whitbread’ and went up his nose or down his ear.I’m sure Foggy won a lot of last-minute votes because he was the celebrity undergoing the eating trial – which is the one we all want to see and the real reason we all watch IACGMOOH.Having already downed a glass of deer’s blood and some other horrors in the Vile Vineyard challenge, Fogarty duly polished off a cup of mealworms (which were still alive), the anus of an ostrich (not alive), some baked tarantulas, three large cockroaches and a camel’s penis.Yum. I mean, yuck.He may have been the celebrities ‘Tarzan’ figure, a macho motor-biking icon, and the man who took care of the fire and other manly tasks, but you could see even Fogarty didn’t relish eating them. Not as much as Freddie Starr had anyway. The fact he had to dance around as he swallowed them down proved that, practically pogoing at one point.The tarantulas, he said memorably, tasted like ‘dog s**t wrapped in Kentucky,’ which probably rules out that sponsorship deal.For those of you who are interested, he reported ‘the ostrich anus was ‘quite hard and chewy’ and the camel penis ‘had no taste to it.’Fogarty's wife probably regrets the exuberant way she stuck her tongue down his throat before checking he'd brushed his teeth since eating that ostrich anus. A schoolgirl errorWith the current vogue for exotic meat and Heston Blumenthal types in the country’s restaurants, this was a relief - especially for any camels watching.When Ant & Dec announced that Carl had won, Jake looked slightly gutted.‘I couldn’t have won to a better man,’ he stuttered – perhaps a sub-conscious slip as he dreamed of joining such illustrious names as Joe Swash and that bloke from either Westlife or Boyzone last year.We knew what he meant though.You could see how much winning meant to the former Superbike champion although his wife probably regrets the exuberant way she

              "2897  A UFO appears to fire a red laser beam toward Earth from outside the International Space Station, in a video excerpted from the live NASA online video feed from the ISS on December 5. But what does NASA have to say about this latest bizarre UFO sighting at the space station?The red laser incident marks the third time since mid October that the NASA video feed has captured what UFO watchers believe to be an alien craft in close proximity to the International Space Station. But while in the previous two sightings the supposed UFO appeared to be merely observing the space station in operation, this time, whatever the entity is — or is not — seems to be taking aggressive action toward our planet.Or is it?NASA has what appears to be a very interesting explanation for the red laser. But first, what do the UFO watchers think they see in the video?“Although red UFOs have been seen near the ISS, witnessing a beam of light from one of then has never been recorded before,” wrote Scott Waring on his popular UFO Sightings Daily site. “Lucky for us, Streetcap1 of Youtube caught this anomaly while watch the NASA cams. He keeps a watchful eye out for any UFOs near the station. The question is, what is that beam and should we be worried about it?“I watch the ISS all the time and almost every day I see something strange that is unexplainable and this is definitely one of them,” wrote one commenter on the site, while another claimed to suffer headaches as a result of sighting an earlier UFO shooting a laser beam.But according to NASA, there’s a very Earthly explanation for the leaser beam in space.The laser beam was actually a test firing of the new Optical Payload for Laser Communcation, or OPALS, system run in part by NASA from its Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California.The purpose of OPALS is to create a new, ultra-high speed communications link between Earth and spacecraft such as the space station.But UFO Sightings Daily editor Scott Waring is not convinced. He says that he is familiar with OPALS, and the laser beam in the video is not it.“I built a laser communicator before DARPA did and I have some experience with it. This laser is not hitting the space station. The lasers I saw were purple, which has a better frequency and higher sound quality than red laser,” Waring wrote on his site. “I have see OPALS at work at the ISS live cam. What I saw was not one, but many lasers hitting the ISS solar panels in a row at the same time.”But if Waring is correct and the laser in the December 5 UFO video is not the NASA OPALS project in action — then what is it?

She sent a text message to the seller:“Hi there. I was wondering if you still have your Nutribullet for sale and if so would you consider posting it? I could pay via PayPal so we’re both protected. I’ve been looking for one for my mom as part of her cancer treatment, but just can’t afford the $200 (retail) price tag. Many thanks! Cara”The seller immediately responded:“I’m sorry to hear your mum has cancer. Just send me your address I will post it to you and you don’t have to pay for it. I also pray for your mum. And if there is anything I can do for you please let me know.”Cara was shocked by the offer, insisting she is willing to pay for the device. She also shared more details about her mother:“Hi! That is so kind but we are honestly willing to pay if you can send us your PayPal address? … Prayers would be greatly appreciated, her cancer is very advanced but we are staying positive and want to give her green juices to help with treatment so we think a Nutribullet would be great! Many thanks, Cara.”That’s when Cara received a text message stating her “FastTrack” order was available for pickup. The seller of the used Nutribullet sent her a message that said:“It’s paid now please collect it today as I don’t want you and your mum to wait for the Nutribullet.”Cara was confused by the text message:“I’m confused. Did you buy a new one? How is it ready today?”The seller responded:“Yes I bought a new one and it’s paid for. You just need to collect it.”The seller had purchased a brand new Nutribullet from a local Argos store. He placed the order in Cara’s name.Cara, obviously overwhelmed, thanked the seller for the kind gesture.The seller responded:“Don’t say thanks to me. In fact, thanks to you for giving me this opportunity.”Cara said she did not believe it until she went to the store and the cashier handed her the brand new Nutribullet. She wrote:“In Argos when I went to collect it thinking it would be some kind of joke. When she handed it to me I cried lol. So had to explain and she was just staring at me open-mouthed!”For those who want to donate to the Duggan family, you can visit their GoFundMe page.Credit: Cara Grace Duggan

But I’ve been very happily married for seven years to a penis. Ha ha! An amazing guy.”While she stresses that she and Belafonte have a \"very tight and solid\" relationship that isn't open, she added, \"But I will be the first one to compliment a woman, to say to my husband, ‘Oh my God, look at her legs;’ or ‘Doesn’t she look stunning?’ I do think women are gorgeous. Crazy but gorgeous.\"Read the full Guardian interview here.Earlier this year, Mel B. told British TV host Alan Carr that she was \"just one of those ladies\" who had sexual experiences with women, according to the Daily Mail.In 2013, she told Howard Stern that she'd \"kissed all\" of her Spice Girls bandmates.\"I got my tongue pierced and I wanted to try out my tongue piercing and so I kissed them all,\" she said at the time. “Back in the day I had fun.\"CLARIFICATION: This article has been updated to specify that Mel B. is a judge on the British and not the U.S. version of \"X Factor.\"

              "2907  Antarctic sea ice is increasing - that's old news - but now it's also thicker than scientists thought, and that's only adding to the confusion.A project to map Antarctic sea ice over the last four years from below using an underwater robot has produced the most detailed images of the sea ice to date, surveying an area of 500,000 square meters, or a fifth of a square mile.For years the expanding sea ice in the Antarctic has been the focus of a lot of research, and a source of controversy, with climate change skeptics claiming it offsets the wide scale melting of Arctic sea ice.That's what Jay Lehr has argued. Lehr is the science director for the Heartland Institute - a conservative think tank that has repeatedly spoken out against climate change science.Lehr said, \"Global warming activists like to claim global consequences resulting from carbon dioxide emissions, yet they conveniently forget to discuss the global nature of polar sea ice data. Instead, they only talk about Arctic sea ice, because that is the only polar region where sea ice is receding\"But scientists say the melting in the Arctic and the expanding ice in the Antarctic don't really balance each other out at all.NASA's Dr. Walt Meier put it this way: \"That's simply not true. If you look at just simply the magnitude of the changes we're seeing in the winter time, the Arctic is decreasing about twice as fast as what the Antarctic is increasing.\"And while scientists haven't pinpointed the main cause of expanding sea ice in the Antarctic, they're not exactly clueless.RiAus's Paul Willis said, \"More rain and snow other effects of climate change could be layering the southern ocean with a cool dense layer on top. Rain and snow could also be freshening the surface waters and thus increasing the local freezing point for sea-ice formation.\"Another possible reason is because Antarctic ice is based around a landmass - the continent of Antarctica - cold winds come off the continent and help form more ice, something that doesn't happen in the Arctic.Adding to the confusion, while Antarctic sea ice is expanding as a whole, there's also a lot of melting going on, at uneven rates.\"Here in the Bellingshausen Sea we find the area of sea ice is shrinking rapidly, compared to other areas of the Antarctic sea ice so therefore we're trying to understand the process of why this area of sea ice in the Bellingshausen sea is reducing,\" said Jeremy Wilkinson.Scientists hope this first survey of sea ice thickness can pave the way for more extensive surveys in the future.

              "2912  REUTERS/Adam Dean A North Korean soldier looks out from a boat at the bank of the Yalu River at the North Korean town of Sinuiju, October 13, 2006. Whether North Korea was responsible for the Sony hack or not, the consensus is that North Korea has some of the best hackers in the world.There have been some reports recently about North Korea’s special cyber warfare unit, known as Bureau 121. The North Korean government has made grooming its “cyber warriors” a top priority for decades, and has given first class treatment to its hackers.Jang Se-yul, a North Korean defector who now leads an organization called North Korea People’s Liberation Front in Seoul, could have been one of them. Before defecting to South Korea in 2007, Jang went to Mirim University, the country’s top engineering college, which is now called the University of Automation. Although he wasn’t a hacker — his major was War Game Strategy, focused on cyber warfare simulations — Jang took classes with the hackers that are now in Bureau 121. After graduation, Jang worked at North Korea’s General Bureau of Reconnaissance, the intelligence agency that Bureau 121 is a part of. He says he still keeps in touch with some of those hackers.Business Insider had a chance to speak with Jang and hear more about the inner workings of North Korea’s elite hacking force. Here’s what he told us:How they’re trained: Mirim University produces most of the hackers that get placed in Bureau 121. It’s a highly competitive program, with each class accepting only about 100 students out of 5,000 applicants. They take six 90-minute classes every day, learning different coding languages and operating systems, from C to Linux. Jang says a lot of time was spent dissecting Microsoft programs, like the Windows operating system, and how to attack the overall computer IT systems of enemy countries like the US or South Korea. But the core principle is to develop its own hacking programs and computer viruses without having to rely on programs already built in the outside world. Jang says he believes North Korean hackers are as good as the top programmers at Google or CIA, if not already better. “Especially in terms of coding, I’m confident they’re better because they’ve invested in it for so long,” he says.What it’s like to work for Bureau 121: They’re all very sophisticated professional hackers, with almost nine years of intense training by the time they get hired. They’re split into different focus groups based on countries to attack, like the US, South Korea, and Japan. Once they’re placed in their respective groups, they spend nearly two years traveling to their assigned country, learning the language and culture. The ability to travel outside of North Korea and make US dollars is part of the reason so many North Koreans want this job. Jang estimates there are about 1,800 cyber warriors in Bureau 121.Their living conditions are much better than most North Koreans': they receive high salaries, a free apartment over 2,000 sq ft in downtown Pyongyang, and their family can move to Pyongyang as well, which is a big privilege. They’re among the top 1% who are happy with their lives in North Korea. In fact, with free access to the internet, these hackers are all aware of what’s going on in the outside world and how reclusive their country is — but they still won’t leave their country. “No matter how hard you try to convince them, they won’t leave — even if you offered them a job at the Blue House (the official residence of the South Korean president),” Jang says.KCNA The ultimate goal: North Korea realizes they have no chance fighting their enemies in conventional warfare. But in cyber space, they can create chaos with relatively few resources. It’s why the North Korean government has spent so much effort in this area since the 1980s. They call it the “Secret War.” Jang says the ultimate goal is to attack the central IT infrastructure of enemy countries, primarily the government, and steal as much information as possible while also causing social pandemonium. According to Jang, the North Korean hackers say attacking South Korean government servers is like “swimming while touching the ground.” Although he wouldn’t be able to say for sure how advanced their skills are, Jang says the hackers could probably “easily” crack into company servers, too.He also said he’s “absolutely sure” North Korea is behind the Sony hacks. The fact that people are still skeptical of North Korea’s involvement is the very reason North Korea is so focused on cyber attacks: they can cause massive confusion without being definitively fingered.The bigger problem is this is only going to get worse. “The US is definitely not in a safety zone. North Korea’s prepared for this for over 20 years. The U.S. shouldn’t take them lightly,” he said.NOW WATCH: 11 Mind-Blowing Facts About North KoreaMore From Business InsiderSouth Korean Columnist: U.S. Shouldn't Ratchet Tension Up Over 'One Low-Class

              "2913  By Sloane BradshawAt first it was easy for me to point every single finger and toe at my husband for obliterating our 10-year marriage. He's the one who cheated and walked out without looking back. And long before that, he repeatedly shut me out, choosing to bury himself in his work to avoid what was happening to us at home.Blame was my coping mechanism to get through the first difficult months of our separation, and \"how dare he (gasp!)\" was my mantra. I rallied an entire army of supporters who, like me, were totally, utterly and completely aghast at the nerve -- the gall -- of this man.Because obviously being a lying, cheating, family abandon-er trumps anything I did to our marriage in the past decade. Right?Wrong.I deflected any and all culpability in the failure of my marriage for months, holding on to the picture I painted of myself as the gentle, selfless and long-suffering wife. It wasn't until I found a therapist who called me out on my bullsh*t that I was forced to take a long, hard look at my shortcomings.It wasn't pretty.Here's what I now know actually screwed up my marriage. May it serve as a warning to you. Before it's too late.1. I put my children first. It's easy to love your own children. It takes very little effort, and they adore you no matter what. Marriage is the polar opposite: it's work. And whenever my marriage started to feel like work, I would check out and head to Build-A-Bear Workshop or the science museum with the kids in tow. I'd often plan these adventures when I knew my husband couldn't go (and spoil my good time). I told myself it was OK because he preferred to work anyway and always seemed grouchy on family outings. I chose most nights to cuddle with them in our bed, blaming his late-night bedtimes and snoring for the sleeping arrangement. As a result, we were hardly alone together and never had kid-free date nights. Well, maybe once a year on our anniversary.2. I didn't set (or enforce) boundaries with my parents. They were at our house frequently, sometimes arriving unannounced and walking right in. They'd \"help out\" around the house doing things we never asked them to, like folding our laundry (incorrectly, of course). We'd vacation with them. They'd correct our children in front of us. My own fears of upsetting my parents kept me from drawing a line in the sand and asking them not to cross it. The few times I did stand up for my family's autonomy, I didn't hold my parents to the same standards in future. My husband, quite literally, married my entire family.3. I emasculated him. I thought love was about honesty, but we all know that the truth hurts. As we grew more comfortable (read: lazy) in our relationship, I stopped trying to take the sting out it. I talked smack to my girlfriends, my mom, my co-workers. All. The. Time. \"Can you believe he didn't do this?\" and \"Why in God's name did he do THAT?\"Instead of building up his ego, I trampled all over it. I belittled him often, saying his job was unimportant and dismissing his friends as \"hangers-on.\" I berated him for doing things wrong when, in all honesty, he just wasn't doing them my way. At times I spoke to him like a child. I controlled the family finances and grilled him over every single penny he spent. And in the bedroom -- yup, you guessed it -- he was doing that all wrong too, and I wasn't shy about telling him so. As our marriage crumbled, I found myself constantly looking for faults and mistakes so that I could justify my superiority. By the end, I had zero respect for him and I made sure he knew it and felt it every day.4. I didn't bother to learn to fight the right way. I know it sounds odd to suggest there is a right way to fight. But there is. I tended to keep the peace in our house by keeping my mouth shut when things were really bothering me. As you can imagine, all the small things that drove me crazy grew into a giant suppressed ball of anger that would erupt occasionally in a huge, really frightening fit of Hulk-like rage. And by rage, I mean rage in the clinical, mental-health definition kind of way. After the fact, I'd justify my anger by saying that a woman can only take so much. Looking back, I was one scary b*tch during those episodes.More from YourTango: 8 Rules You MUST Follow When Fighting With Your HusbandI write this mea culpa not with the hopes of winning my ex back, or even wanting his forgiveness. I write this because I can't believe how long I kept my head buried in the sand. I hope other women out there will yank theirs out and take a good look around. And while I'm still hurt that my husband chose to solve our problems in another woman's bed when some conversation and counseling might have helped, I absolutely know that my behavior was part of what pushed him there.This article originally appeared on YourTango.More great content from YourTango: Got Kids?

              "2920  The Syrian regime may have just gotten a much deadlier weapon. (AFP/File)These days, there's neither a shortage of Syrian conflict propaganda, nor is there a lack of international players chiming in. But in case you forgot, a video this week serves as a pretty good reminder.The video itself appears to be from 2013, but was uploaded to YouTube this week. Complete with a video description to \"make short work of Turkish/Israeli jets if they have the balls to interfere with Syrian territories,\" the footage purports to show an example of a Mikoyan MiG-31 fighter jet, six of which have reportedly been delivered ton the Syrian Army from Moscow this week.  According to Iranian state news agency Press TV, the Russian shipment is part of a deal between Moscow and Damascus forged back in 2007. And while neither side has confirmed their role here so far, it's definitely not the first time Russian crafts have shown up on MENA battlefields — Moscow shipped Mi-28 attack helicopters to Baghdad in 2014.It's also not the first time this Russian jet has come up in headlines this year. Large-scale military training operations carried out by the Russian military with the crafts had Western countries worried back in May. Back then, a NATO official told CNN the following on the condition of anonymity.“Three of the [training exercises] have included over 80,000 troops. Some of them have been used to deploy troops to annex Crimea, mass forces on Ukraine’s border and support the [pro-Moscow rebels in Ukraine].”Apparently, now the same could also be true in Syria. And in a war increasingly defined by external players, that could mean big changes for people on the ground.

              "2922  Hong Kong (CNN)It's usually all about the top cities to live in when the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) publishes its annual livability ranking -- but this year the picture is rather more gloomy.And that's because of a surge in global instability over the past 12 months, from terrorist shootings in France and Tunisia, to ongoing conflicts across the Middle East, Ukraine and Libya.In any event, it's as you were for the \"haves\" at the top of list, with Melbourne taking the top spot for a fifth year running, with Vienna, Vancouver, Toronto and Adelaide/Calgary (tied at 5) completing the top five most livable cities in 2015.According to the EIU, these cities have \"relatively few challenges to living standards,\" and enjoy a good infrastructure, healthcare system and a low murder rate.Unsurprisingly, Damascus remains the least livable city, with Syria embroiled in a bloody civil war.But elsewhere, there's been a marked deterioration in previously stable regions, such as Europe and North America, caused by events such as The Charlie Hebdo attacks in the heart of Paris and race-fueled civil unrest in a number of U.S. cities.READ: Tunisia struggles with jihadist groups\"The EIU ranking, which provides scores for lifestyle challenges in 140 cities worldwide, shows that since 2010 average liveability across the world has fallen by 1%, led by a 2.2% fall in the score for stability and safety. While this may seem marginal, it highlights that 57 of the cities surveyed have seen declines in liveability over the last five years,\" this year's report stated.Bucking the trendBy contrast, some regions have bucked the trend -- seven Chinese cities improved their ranking over the last 12 months \"largely because of a lower threat from civil unrest,\" the report said. \"Chinese cities saw liveability fall in the wake of riots and unrest in 2012, most notably due to widespread anti-Japanese sentiment.\"China's top-ranked city, Beijing, moved up five places to 69 in the global ranking.JUST WATCHED China's new security law covers sea to space More Videos ... MUST WATCH China's new security law covers sea to space05:00But Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests last year resulted in a 3.2% decline in livability. Though the protests were largely peaceful, some parts of the city were brought to a standstill for several months.However \"Asia's World City\" still remained three places above city rival Singapore -- 46th and 49th place respectively.\"Hong Kong's liveability has been hit by the disruptive protests that took place last year. The city retains bragging rights over its regional competitor Singapore, but by a tiny margin. In fact both cities can still lay claim to being in the top tier of liveability where few, if any, aspects of life are restricted. This has not been the case in other parts of the world, with instability and unrest features undermining the scores of a number of cities globally,\" said Jon Copestake, editor of the EIU survey.Top five most livable:1.

              "2934  A police officer recently had his faith in humanity restored after posing as a wheelchair user.Sergeant Mark Horsely went undercover as a wheelchair-bound person in downtown Vancouver following two reported incidents of people in wheelchairs being mugged at knife-point, but he was pleasantly surprised with what he found.Pretending that he also suffered from a brain injury, Sgt Horesly interacted with members of the public, however rather than being taken advantage of, he was met with a stream of goodwill.One man zipped his money pouch up for him, some actually gave him money, while another even prayed for him.MORE: 99-year-old great-grandmother told she is pregnant after hospital blunderNot one person tried to exploit Sgt Horsely (Picture:

any way.‘The caring and compassion expressed to me in my undercover role was inspiring – this community has sole,’ he said.He goes on to use the example set by the people in the video to warn would-be criminals who exploit the vulnerable.He said: ‘You should know the police are watching, but more importantly the people of the downtown east-side are watching.’MORE: Girl, 12, plays the piano while

              "2939  Photo via Reddit Since Yahoo Parenting launched on Oct. 23, the editors and writers have posted nearly 600 stories on the site. They chose this article – originally published on Dec. 8 – as a highlight of the pieces that offer trusted advice, inspire provocative conversations, and hopefully add a little fun to your life, every day.What does a night in the life of a dad look like? For 28-year-old Jon Arrigo, who posted a picture on Reddit last week entitled “Just being a dad,” it looks pretty good: Playing video games, snuggling with one daughter while getting his toenails painted by the other.Arrigo posted the photo on December 2, and with nearly 2000 comments, it quickly became one of the top posts of the day. In the photo, the Erie, Pennsylvania, dad is playing a video game, resting his feet on a table covered in stickers while his 3-year-old daughter, Emilia, gives him a multi-colored pedicure. His one-year-old, Kylie, is by his side. \"I rarely post photos, but I thought this was just a funny picture that showed us all doing what we love to do,\" Arrigo tells Yahoo Parenting. \"It really captured what a typical night looks like at our house.\" As a guy who grew up surrounded by brothers and male cousins, he also wanted to show just how much times have changed. “I think the picture shows what being a dad is about,” he says. “There are no barriers like, ‘Oh I can’t do that because I’m a boy and you’re girls.’ They want to do something, we do it.” STORY: Does Dad’s Joke Go Too Far?Responses to the photo were mixed. Some commenters noted that letting his daughter paint his nails demonstrated Arrigo’s willingness to have a little fun. “That’s awesome, no shame in making your kids happy, this warmed my heart up :)” wrote user Sasha_Fire. “I hope so much that if/when my [significant other] and I decide to have children he’s this awesome of a parent,” echoed Kmccain9. But others questioned Arrigo’s choice to play video games instead of engaging with his kids. “This looks less like multitasking and much more like an amazing ability to ignore his kids,” writes Farren246. “I understand kids are infuriating at times but here it looks like they are being well behaved. Why not interact with them a little? The game will be there when they’re in bed,” says HyperactiveToast.STORY: Adorable Way Toddler Announces She’ll Soon Be a Big SisterBut parenting expert and family physician Dr. Deborah Gilboa says people shouldn’t rush to judge a person’s parenting skills from a single photo. “There’s no way to know, on the basis of a picture, if a person is a good or bad parent,” she tells Yahoo Parenting. “But we can say that he is comfortable in his skin and wanted to connect with his daughter.” Parenting isn’t always about sitting on the floor and interacting with our kids, she says. Sometimes just being in the same room is enough. “Sometimes we play with our kids and sometimes we are simply with our kids, and that really is ok.”And while Gilboa says there’s no way to know what’s going on in a family from one picture, what she takes from the photo is the impression of a father who lets his kids express themselves. “They were clean and comfortable and have a cool table with stickers,” she says. “At least he didn’t kick anyone out of the room and say ‘don’t bother me I’m playing video games.’”

              "2940  Warning: \"The Walking Dead\" spoilers everywhere.In a preview for the final episodes for Season 5 of \"The Walking Dead,\" the cast and producers are dropping hints about what to expect. Showrunner Scott Gimple said the second half of the season will have \"a huge change for the situation of these characters.\" Andrew Lincoln later added, \"It feels that we're moving into a new show.\"Whether it was getting to Terminus or surviving The Governor's attacks, the characters in the show have always had a central motivation, but with Washington, D.C. revealed to be a bust and everyone moving on from the events at Grady Memorial Hospital, the future of the survivors is really up in the air.Co-executive producer Denise Huth said the second half of the season is \"dark\" and \"sad,\" while Lauren Cohan said Maggie will be dealing with a \"dark side\" of her own (which actually sounds like good news for \"Star Wars\" fans waiting on \"The Force Awakens\"). In any case, it appears Norman Reedus was genuine with his warning to HuffPost Entertainment to \"grab your tissues.\"\"The Walking Dead\" returns February 2015 to AMC.

              "2947  A slight change in the process used to prepare tomatoes for sale could make them tastier. (Daniel Acker/Bloomberg)If you've ever compared a farm-fresh heirloom tomato to the average fruit from a grocery store, you know the latter is a pale substitution. But by slightly tweaking the way tomatoes are prepared for sale, scientists say, they can make them just a bit yummier. The key is giving tomatoes a nice hot soak before they head to the store.Tomatoes in the grocery store aren't generally freshly picked. They've been shipped from another location, spending days or weeks in storage to make it to store shelves. And that means that they weren't actually red and ripe when they were picked -- if they had been, they'd be a rotten mess by the time they arrived.[The mad science behind vegetable grafting]So tomatoes are picked green and ripened at the opportune moment using a gas called ethylene. It's totally natural -- it's the gas that tomatoes, apples, bananas, and other fruits release when they ripen, and its presence signals other fruits nearby to get going -- but what comes after is no good for your taste buds: Once the fruits have been perfectly ripened, they're stored in the cold to keep them from going bad.It turns out that the lower temperatures really degrade fruit flavor. At the National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society this week, researchers presented a simple solution: Just give the fruit a nice, hot bath beforehand.[Strawberries are in big trouble. Scientists race to find solution.]In the experiment, which was led by researchers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, and the University of Florida, Florida-grown tomatoes were dipped in hot water (about 125 degrees Fahrenheit) for five minutes before getting the same chilly treatment as the other tomatoes.The hot bath seemed to mitigate some of the tasteless effects of the chilling. Important flavor compounds -- the chemicals that give tomatoes their taste -- were more abundant in the experimental tomatoes, even after they'd been chilled and stored.The researchers are working on figuring out whether other techniques -- one that caught the tomatoes earlier in the production process, or allowed them to ripen on the vine for a bit longer without risking decay en route to their final destination -- might make tomatoes taste even better.Read More:Why nuking frozen veggies might be healthier than poaching fresh greensStrawberries are in big trouble.

              "2952  AP Photo /Martin Meissner, fileAn ALDI market in Gelsenkirchen, Germany.Chances are that you have never set foot inside the best grocery store in America: Aldi. And even if you are lucky enough to be in one of the 32 states where Aldi is, perhaps you were put-off by the cardboard boxes in lieu of shelves, or the row upon row of suspicious-looking off-brands. What is this place? Why do I have to put down a deposit to check out a cart? What is the weird giant shelf by the exit? And what do you mean, I have to pay for a bag?Calm your hormones, meine Schatzis: Aldi, which is short for Albrecht Discount, is the American incarnation of a German grocery chain that is so ubiquitous in the Vaterlandthat almost 90 percent of Germans shop there. (Not all German imports are luxury cars, beer, and super-cool glasses.)Aldi is part of a charming subset of Teutonic trade: the brother-run company that cleaves in twain. Shoe aficionados already know the story of the Dassler brothers, Adolf and Rudolf, whose bitter feud resulted in the creation of Adidas and Puma. (Germans pronounce Adidas differently— some might say correctly — AH-dee-das, fromAdi Dassler.) But outside Germany, few know about grocery-store kingpins Karl and Theo Albrecht (who was kidnapped in 1971!)—even though Karl, with a reported net worth of more than 17 billion euros, is the richest man in Germany (Theo’s descendants are a close second).The Brüder founded their discount-store empire together. A disagreement in 1960 over selling cigarettes hastened a partition, and an epic game of grocery-store Risk: Theo would rename his business Aldi Nord, and would control territories north of the Rhine, plus a healthy chunk of Europe. Karl would head up Aldi Süd, and get southern Germany, more of Europe, plus the U.K. and Ireland. But both companies operate stores in the United States — Aldi Süd operates as Aldi, and Aldi Nord as the now ubiquitous Trader Joe’s.But whereas Trader Joe’s employs just one major cost-saving device — private labeling —everything else about it is Americanized. The place is swarming with upbeat employees; cashiers stand at the till and bag your products for you; you just grab a cart willy-nilly and they trust you to put it back. Aldi also private-labels (those $1.99 “Millville” Rice Squares are Chex, you guys!), but what makes it a more exciting venture — and even cheaper than Trader Joe’s—is that it has imported the entire German grocery experience (aside, alas, from employees yelling at you if you do something wrong).If you’ve ever visited Germany, you’ve noticed that a 4-ounce glass of juice at a restaurant may run you $10, while groceries — often of much higher quality than their American counterparts—will be noticeably less expensive. This is in part because of cost-cutting shopping practices whose arrival stateside I greet with a robust “Wunderbar!”You can always tell an American in Germany by the way they incredulouslydon’t get that nobody is going to bag their groceries for them — they’re expected to do so (and schnell!) while the seated cashier is ringing them up. Shoppers also have the option of quickly sticking wares back into the cart and schlepping them over to a special low, wide shelf that’s an official bagging area. As for the cart: It requires a deposit, and customers must return them to their rightful place —without the help of an employee — if they want their money back.These are standard practices at even upscale German Supermärkte, so high-end groceries are cheaper relative to other goods than they are here. This is why I am hoping for Aldi’s rousing success in Amiland: so that more of our stores, and our culture in general, will incorporate such Teutonic efficiency. First the cost-savings of bagging our own groceries — then the ubiquitous bicycle lanes; immaculate, punctual public transportation; and, finally, required paid vacation and parental leave. It would be ausgezeichnet indeed, meine Lieben.

              "2959  Excerpted from Uniquely Human: A Different Way of Seeing Autism.The first thing I noticed about Jesse was the fear and anxiety in his eyes.I was visiting a small New England school district when I heard about an eight-year-old boy who had recently transferred from a nearby district. There he had earned a dubious distinction: administrators called Jesse the worst behavior problem they had ever encountered.It wasn’t difficult to understand why, given his challenges. Jesse, a sturdy boy with straight brown hair and wire-rimmed glasses, struggled with severe social anxiety, extreme sensitivity to touch, and difficulty processing language. He also had a seizure disorder that was detected when he was a toddler, about the time he lost the ability to speak. He communicated with little more than guttural sounds and grunts, pushing away people and objects or physically leading people to what he wanted.Since it was so difficult for Jesse to make his needs known, he often seemed aggravated and miserable. He sometimes took out his frustration and anxiety on himself, pounding his fists against his thighs and his forehead, covering his body with bruises. When teachers tried to direct him from one activity to the next, he often reacted with flailing limbs or by pushing them away with his arms or legs. Reports from the previous school described kicking, scratching, and biting episodes escalating into fits so severe that almost daily, three or four adults had to pin the boy down to subdue him, then isolate him in a “time-out” room.The staff had interpreted all of this as willful, uncooperative behavior. But Jesse’s mother knew better. She understood that his actions were his way of communicating—a direct reflection of his confusion, agitation, and fear. When she explained to the administrators that her son struggled with sensory challenges that made him unusually sensitive to loud noises and being touched, they had been dismissive. Clearly, they insisted, the boy was displaying noncompliant behavior. In their eyes, Jesse was strong-willed, stubborn, and defiant, and their response was to try to break him—to treat him as a trainer would treat a horse.What did these educators offer to help Jesse learn to communicate? Practically nothing. The district’s policy was to focus first on controlling a child’s behavior, and, only after achieving success, to address the area of communication.They had it all wrong.I had heard so many awful things about Jesse that I was intrigued to come face-to-face with him. When I finally did, I didn’t observe any of what I had heard described—not the defiance, not the aggression, not the willful disobedience. What I saw was a boy who was understandably frightened, anxious, and constantly on guard. And I saw something else: Jesse’s extreme vigilance and anxiety were manifestations of the inevitable damage that occurs when people— however well meaning—completely misunderstand the behavior of individuals with autism.How does this happen? The short answer is that caregivers neglect to ask “Why?” They don’t listen carefully or observe closely. Instead of seeking to understand the child’s perspective and experience, they simply try to manage the behavior.Unfortunately this behavioral-assessment approach—that is, using a checklist of deficits—has become the standard way of determining whether a person has autism. We say a child has autism if he displays a combination of traits and behaviors that are deemed to be problematic: difficulty in communicating, trouble developing relationships, and a restricted repertoire of interests and behaviors, including repetitive speech—known as echolalia—and actions, such as rocking, arm flapping, and spinning. Professionals observe these “autistic behaviors” and then assess the people who display them by using a sort of circular reasoning: Why does Rachel flap her hands? Because she has autism. Why has she been diagnosed with autism? Because she flaps.Following this approach means defining a child as the sum of his deficits. How best to help such a child? By managing those behaviors or attempting to get rid of them: to halt the rocking, to squelch the echoing speech, to reduce the flapping. And what denotes success? The more we can make a child look and act “normal,” the better.This way of understanding and supporting people with autism is sorely lacking. It treats the person as a problem to be solved rather than an individual to be understood. It fails to show respect for the individual and ignores that person’s perspective and experience. It neglects the importance of listening, paying close attention to what the person is trying to tell us, whether through speech or patterns of behavior.On top of that, in my experience it doesn’t work—and often makes things worse.What’s more helpful is to dig deeper: to ask what is motivating these behaviors, what is underlying these patterns. It’s more appropriate, and more effective, to ask “Why?” Why is she rocking? Why does he line up his toy cars that way, and why only when he arrives home from school? Why does he stare at his hands fluttering in front of his eyes, and always during English class and recess? Why does she repeat certain phrases when she is upset?The Challenge of DysregulationUsually the answer is that the person is experiencing some degree of emotional dysregulation. When we are well regulated emotionally, we are most available for learning and engaging with others. We all strive to be alert, focused, and prepared to participate in activities in our daily lives. Our neurological systems help by filtering out excessive stimulation, telling us when we’re hungry or tired or when to protect ourselves from danger. People with autism, primarily due to underlying neurology (the way the brain’s wiring works), are unusually vulnerable to everyday emotional and physiological challenges. So they experience more feelings of discomfort, anxiety, and confusion than others. They also have more difficulty learning how to cope with these feelings and challenges.To be clear: Difficulty staying well regulated emotionally and physiologically should be a core, defining feature of autism. Unfortunately professionals have long overlooked this, focusing on the resulting behaviors instead of the underlying causes.If you know a person with autism, consider what makes this person less able to stay well regulated: problems in communicating, environments that are chaotic, people who are confusing because they talk or move too quickly, unexpected change, excessive worry about things that are uncertain. Then there are associated challenges, such as sensory sensitivities to touch and sound, motor and movement disturbances, sleep deprivation, allergies, and gastrointestinal issues.Of course people with autism aren’t alone in experiencing these challenges. We all feel dysregulated from time to time. Speaking in front of a large audience, you might feel sweat collecting on your brow, your hands might quiver, your heart might race. Wearing a scratchy wool sweater might be so irritating that you can’t focus. When your normal morning routine—coffee, newspaper, shower— is thrown off by an unexpected intrusion, you might feel out of sorts for the rest of the morning. When these factors accumulate—you miss sleep, you’re under a deadline, you skip lunch, and then your computer crashes—it’s easy to become extremely agitated.We all have these challenges, but people with autism are unusually ill equipped to deal with them because of their neurology. That makes them far more vulnerable than others—that is, their threshold can be much lower—and they have fewer innate coping strategies. In many cases, they also have sensory-processing differences: they are either highly sensitive or undersensitive to sound, light, touch, and other sensations and therefore less able to manage. In addition many people with autism are innately unaware of how others might interpret their actions when they are dysregulated.Feeling emotionally dysregulated affects different people in different ways. Often the reactions are immediate and impulsive. A child’s behavior may shift suddenly, with no apparent cause. When a child is exposed to a loud noise, for instance, he might drop to the floor. I often see children refuse to enter a gym class or the school cafeteria. Their teachers might mistakenly believe that this is willful disobedience, a planned attempt to escape an activity the child doesn’t enjoy. The reason is typically much deeper than that: the child can’t bear the volume or quality of the noise or the chaos of the setting.When I worked in a preschool autism program based in a hospital, the children ate lunch in the classroom on trays brought up from the hospital cafeteria. Once a teacher and I led the four- and five-year-olds to the cafeteria’s kitchen so they could see how the trays were cleaned. At exactly the moment we arrived, the industrial-size dishwasher spewed forth steam and suddenly emitted a high-frequency SSSHHHH! Instantly all the children dropped their trays, some covered their ears and screamed, and they ran for the exit. It was as if a monster had suddenly appeared, inches from their faces.That’s dysregulation, sudden and visible.Sometimes the cause of dysregulation is less obvious. While visiting a preschool where I consulted, I was walking outdoors with Dylan, a four-year-old with autism, when suddenly and without warning, he dropped to the ground and refused to proceed. I gently picked him up and helped him along, but soon he dropped again. As I helped him again, we heard a dog barking. He immediately panicked and tried to run away from the sound. It dawned on me that Dylan, with his hypersensitive hearing, had heard the dog all along, but its bark had been so distant that it hadn’t registered with me. What might have appeared as uncooperative, random, or defiant behavior was in fact a very understandable expression of fear.That too is dysregulation.Many children with autism flap their arms, either as an expression of their level of excitement or to calm themselves. When Conner felt joyful, and sometimes when he was anxious about a transition between activities, he did what his parents called his “happy dance.” He stood on his toes and stepped forward, then back, while flicking his fingers in front of his eyes. An earlier therapist had advised Conner’s parents to respond with a firm “Hands down!” And if he didn’t comply: “Sit down, sit on hands!” (To their credit, his parents ignored the suggestion, instead helping Conner to label his feelings or easing transitions by telling him what to expect.)It’s easy to dismiss flapping or rocking or dancing as just so much “autistic behavior.” But parents raising children with autism, and the professionals who work with them, need to take an extra step. Like detectives, we need to examine and consider all available clues and work to discern what is underlying or triggering a particular reaction. What is making the child dysregulated? Is it internal or external? Is it visible? Is it in the sensory realm? Is it pain, or physical discomfort, or a traumatic memory? In most cases the child can’t explain the behavior in words, so it’s up to those close to him to sort through the clues.Coping Strategies and Regulating BehaviorsHere is the important irony: Most of the behaviors commonly labeled “autistic behaviors” aren’t actually deficits at all. They’re strategies the person uses to feel better regulated emotionally.In other words, in many cases they’re strengths.When a child with extreme sensory sensitivities enters a noisy room and cups his hands over his ears and rocks his body, this pattern of behavior is simultaneously a sign of dysregulation and a coping strategy. You could call it “autistic behavior.” Or you could ask “Why is he doing that?” The answer is twofold: the child is revealing that something is amiss and that he has developed a response to shut out what is causing him anxiety.Whether or not we realize it, all humans employ these rituals and habits to help us regulate ourselves—soothe ourselves, calm our minds and bodies, and help us cope. Perhaps, like many people, you find public speaking unnerving. To calm yourself, you might take a series of deep breaths or pace back and forth while you speak. That’s not exactly the way humans typically breathe or behave in public, but an observer would not judge this as deviant behavior. The person would understand that it’s your way to cope with the stress of the situation and to soothe your nerves so that you can do your best.When I return home from a day of work, I immediately check the mailbox, then sort the mail, placing bills in one pile, magazines in another, and tossing what I don’t need in the recycling bin. It would take a significant distraction for me to skip that small but important ritual; then I would feel out of sorts on some level until I took care of it. It’s a calming routine; it’s how I come home. When my wife has had a bad day or feels worried, she organizes and cleans. If I come home and find our home more immaculate than usual, I know that something is bothering her. Religious services include layers of comforting rituals—chanting and praying, symbolic gestures and body movements—to enable people to let go of the worries and trivialities of everyday life and enter a higher spiritual realm.For people with autism, comforting rituals and coping mechanisms come in all varieties: moving in particular ways, speaking in various patterns, carrying familiar items, lining up objects to create predictable and unchanging surroundings. Even proximity to certain people can serve as a regulating strategy.Excerpted from Uniquely Human: A Different Way of Seeing Autism by Barry M. Prizant with Tom Fields-Meyer.

              "2964  “The Nutcracker” is as much a part of the holidays as Black Friday and the Yule log. And while Lincoln Center has what many consider the quintessential production, there are lots of ways to crack this classic. Here are a handful of NYC’s mixed “Nuts,” for every type of fan.Hot Nuts (For the Erotically Inclined)Company XIV’s decadent “Nutcracker Rouge” is a glamorously trashy vaudeville that mixes baroque luxe with steamy burlesque. Creator Austin McCormick loves the shiny and gilded — as well as plenty of skin. It’s not for tots — only 21 and older will be admitted — but there’s magic in the thrift-shop excess. “Nutcracker Rouge” by Company XIV. Through Jan. 4 at XIV, 428 Lafayette St. $75 to $125; companyxiv.comHip-Hop Nuts (For Fly Fans)Up in Washington Heights, dancers fill the fourth-largest theater in Manhattan with a hip-hop adaptation of the tale, set in the Heights on New Year’s Eve instead of Christmas.

Dec. 6 and 7 at the Emelin Theatre, 153 Library Lane, Mamaroneck, NY. $42; emelin.orgMischievous Nuts (For Rascally Revelers)If too many sugarplums make your children’s fillings ache, American Ballet Theatre’s version is for them. The production, by MacArthur “genius” Alexei Ratmansky, is as skewed and colorful as Lewis Carroll’s Wonderland. Alongside with speedy, ornate dancing is Ratmansky’s ability to tune in to the gruesome: When dancing in the snow, Clara and the Prince narrowly escape freezing to death. “The Nutcracker” by American Ballet Theatre. Dec. 12 through 21 at BAM, 30 Lafayette Ave., Brooklyn. $20 to $195; abt.orgClassic Nuts (For Sentimental Spectators)This is the Mother Ginger of all NYC “Nutcrackers.” With the nostalgia of Balanchine’s classic comes the enchantment of a corps of snowflakes rushing through a pillowy blizzard, and a stage arrayed with sugar candy of every imaginable kind. “The Nutcracker” by New York City Ballet.

              "2969  InstagramCindy Crawford and her daughter Kaia Gerber could practically be twins!The 48-year-old supermodel mama Instagrammed a picture with her 13-year-old mini-me Wednesday, and as you can see, even next to a teenager, Cindy still has that youthful glow!It appears, too, that Kaia is clever just like her mama. In the snap, she proudly holds up a handful of property cards, and Cindy happily admits her little girl \"just destroyed me in #monopoly. #oldschoolfun.\"Cindy doesn't look too bothered by this loss, though. In fact, the mother of two (she and hubby Rande Gerber are also the parents of a 15-year-old son, Preston) still looks effortlessly carefree. How is that possible after all these years? It's actually pretty simple.VIDEO: Cindy Crawford & Rande Gerber talk married pals George and Amal Clooney!\"The secret is that there is no secret,\" she revealed in a recent interview for The Violet Files. \"Do all the stuff we know: Don't smoke, get enough sleep, drink plenty of water, find what makes you happy.\"She stays on top of her beauty routine, too. \"I use SPF day cream every day, cleanser every day and night. I definitely use the night cream, eye cream and the Crème de Serum from my line,\" she said. \"What I think is true is that [results are] cumulative. When a 35-year-old starts taking care of her skin, she won't look different. It's when you're my age that you start seeing the payoff.\"But even ageless beauties like Cindy have to fight off insecurity every now and then. \"I don't want to look in the mirror every day and be down on myself,\" she said. \"Look, I'm holding together pretty good, but I don't look like I did when I was 25 or 30 or even 40. What I'm finding for myself is that if I continue to be engaged, to do what I love, that's how I get my self-esteem cup filled. I get a lot of that from my family and work. I'm good at my job. I know I'm a good model at this point in my career. Though some days I feel like I'm too busy or too stressed out, I'm still excited to go to work. That kind of translates from the internal to the external.\"PHOTOS: Cindy Crawford and more of the hottest celeb bikini bods over 40

              "2972  ABC's morning show \"The View\" has reportedly become a battle ground. According to a New York Daily News report, hosts Whoopi Goldberg and Rosie O'Donnell nearly had an all out brawl during a meeting on Wednesday over how to handle two hot button and racially charged issues. Apparently O'Donnell wanted to take a deeper look into the rape allegations surrounding comedian Bill Cosby and the latest upheaval in Ferguson surrounding the death of Michael Brown. Goldberg reportedly wanted to stay away.One source the Daily News, \"There's terrible frustration and there are problems. Whoopi didn't want to talk about Cosby and Ferguson, Rosie (O'Donnell) did - How could you not? These are topics that are uncomfortable for everyone, but it's 'The View' and it's their job to talk about topics that might make some people tense.\"The argument became so heated, O'Donnell reportedly started screaming, first at Goldberg, then at producers. The source claims fellow host Rosie Perez was so distraught, she had to be consoled by staffers after breaking into tears.However, a spokesperson from \"The View\" says the conflict is all being blown out of proportion.\"This story is mean-spirited and greatly exaggerated by someone who is obviously disgruntled and has some agenda,\" said Lauri Hogan. \"There was no fight.\"Producers on the show say having a strong opinion on issues like these are just part of the job.

              "2978  Alex Goodlett/Getty Andrei Kirilenko only played 36 minutes for the Nets before being traded this season.The Philadelphia 76ers traded for the Brooklyn Nets' Andrei Kirilenko in early December, but Kirilenko has yet to suit up for the 3-23 Sixers.Kirilenko is staying in the New York area because of a family-related health issue, but Kirilenko and his agents have also told the Sixers that he doesn't want to play for the team, Yahoo's Adrian Wojnarowski reports.They'd prefer the Sixers waive or buy out Kirilenko, so he'd be paid the remainder of his $3.3 million salary and become a free agent immediately.However, Sixers GM Sam Hinkie told Kirilenko and his camp that the Sixers have no plans to buy him out, so they're asking him to report to Philadelphia to get in shape and get ready to play, Yahoo reports.It's turning into a bit of an awkward stalemate. According to Wojnarowski, the Sixers have said they'd be accommodating to Kirilenko's family issue and they believe Philadelphia's proximity to New York allows them to help him. Kirilenko, meanwhile, seemingly has no interest in playing for lottery-bound team, and as a free agent this summer, he probably doesn't want to risk injury in meaningless games.If the situation becomes dire enough, Philadelphia can actually mandate that Kirilenko come play for them.According to Wojnarowski, the Sixers probably have little interest in keeping Kirilenko past the trade deadline, but by getting him to play, it could possibly increase his trade value, thus making him an asset for the 76ers to use.Kirilenko hasn't played since November 13.More From Business InsiderNBA POWER RANKINGS: Where Every Team Stands Going Into 2015 The 49 Most Mesmerizing Sports Photos Of 2014 WHERE ARE THEY NOW?

              "2981  When asked by Bill O’Reilly whether Donald Trump was “good for the Republican party,” Chris Christie responded by challenging the primary front-runner to a “robust debate” Tuesday night on Fox News.O’REILLY: I said last night that Trump is good for the Republican Party because it brings a robust debate to the party. Right or wrong? CHRISTIE: Let’s have a robust debate — O’REILLY: Well am I right or am I wrong about Trump? Is he good for the GOP? CHRISTIE: I think every one of those people on the stage is good for the GOP. You saw 10 people on that stage all who made forceful arguments, and I don’t think it’s just about Donald Trump…  O’REILLY: Well, you know the audience wouldn’t have been in there if it wasn’t for him?  CHRISTIE: I don’t know about that. I don’t know about that, Bill. This country has been very concerned. This president has been lawless, and now you’ve got his secretary of state, who in my view is ready to be criminally investigated because of what she’s done.Follow Datoc on Twitter and Facebook

              "2983  Gabriel Aubry is fighting Halle Berry's attempt to slash his child support by more than 75% ... because her husband beat the crap out of him so bad he can't get work, but the photos tell a different story. TMZ has obtained documents filed in their never-ending custody and support war. We broke the story ... Halle is trying to reduce Gabriel's child support for 6-year-old Nahla from $16K a month to around $3,800 a month. Gabriel refers to the Thanksgiving day fight in Halle's driveway back in 2012, in which he accuses Olivier Martinez of a sneak attack that pulverized his face. He says it took him 6 months to heal before he could possibly work again, and since then he's only gotten 3 gigs. But we checked out photos of Gabriel, and just 6 weeks after the fight there's barely a sign of injury. Halle attacks Gabriel as a deadbeat who is using child support to avoid having to work. She says, \"There is no case, no law, no logic that says a healthy, active man gets to simply live off child support that the wealthier mother earns.\" And in Halle's docs, her lawyer, Steve Kolodny, says Gabriel uses monthly child support for his own needs, including: $740 a month for Gabriel's \"Fitness\"   $940 a month in clothing (Gabriel lists Nahla's clothing expenses separately -- $675 a month) $700 a month for Gabriel's health insurance $1,975 a month in car expenses $1,100 a month in furniture and electronics Halle splits custody with Gabriel 50/50. She wants to convince a judge ... during her 50% custody, Gabriel should get off his ass and get a job.

              "2987  You’ve cleared the afternoon to write the speech for your best friend’s wedding.As soon as you sit down, your mind wanders to the street outside your window; the sound of the faucet dripping in the sink; the empty refrigerator. You were supposed to buy groceries. You get up and check the fridge. A glistening bottle of seltzer water in the back makes you realize you’re thirsty. You pour yourself a glass. While sipping, your mind wanders back to the speech.You sit back down, determined to focus this time.If you have ADHD, or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, this might seem like a familiar scenario: You’re used to having relatively simple tasks feel excruciatingly difficult. But while most of us tend to focus on the negatives of ADHD, some of the characteristics we associate with the disorder, from impulsivity to an inability to follow directions, can have some surprising benefits too.1. Being PerceptiveOkay, so your short attention span could mean  that wedding speech will never get written. But being incapable of zeroing in on a single thing might also help you pick up on changes in your surroundings that others might not notice. This could come in especially handy when your job — or even your life — depends on noticing such a change. Say you and some friends are camping, for example. While most of the gang is busy roasting marshmallows, you notice a bear heading straight toward your campground. Your inability to focus on making s'mores just saved your life.Recent research suggests that this kind of behavior may have played a role in how we evolved: Some of our nomadic ancestors had ADHD-like characteristics, too. These people would have been quick to notice changes to their natural environment — such as a stream drying up or an approaching predator — and alerted their family members in time for them to find new sources of water or plan an escape.Thank you, easily-distracted nomads.2. Thinking CreativelyMost bosses, teachers, and parents agree: Having an employee, student, or child who can't follow directions can be infuriating. But an inability to do what one is told might also enable someone with ADHD to come up with creative solutions to problems that others would never dream of.Recent research backs up that idea. In two studies ( one of children and one of adults ), participants with ADHD came up with more novel ideas than those without the disorder.In one test of children who were tasked with coming up with new toy designs, those with ADHD came up with a far more diverse array of different types of toys than those without ADHD. Similarly, i n another test of adults who were asked to think of as many uses as possible for a common object, such as a cup or a brick, those with ADHD outperformed those without it.However, when the adults were given other tasks to test creativity, such as one in which they had to  find something in common amongst three seemingly unrelated items (such as the words  mines, lick, and sprinkle)  those with ADHD performed worse than those without it.3. Expressing EmotionMany people with ADHD also have a hard time controlling their emotions. Researchers aren't sure yet whether this experience is part of ADHD or a separate condition. If you have what's known as emotional dysregulation, you rarely feel apathetic. Whether you're sad, upset, or elated, your emotions tend to be strong and straightforward. While some people might label you emotional, others — especially close friends — might appreciate your tendency to share how you're feeling. And recent research suggests that allowing ourselves to feel emotions as they happen helps us process them and prepare for the future.People with emotional dysregulation also tend to have a hard time recognizing others' emotions and sometimes misinterpret them as a result. While this could certainly be a challenge to forming healthy relationships, research suggests that people can compensate for it with clear communication.4. Tackling Specialized JobsOverall, these characteristics might make people with ADHD better suited than the rest of us for jobs that take advantage of their flexibility and impatience.\"In the right environment, these traits are not a disability, and can be a real asset,\" Weill Cornell Medical College clinical psychiatry professor Richard A. Friedman suggested in a recent op-ed for The New York Times.Jobs that require frequent travel, such as journalism and photography, or positions that require frequently switching from one type of task to another, could be well suited to people who have many of the characteristics associated with ADHD. One of Friedman's patients, he writes, saw a decline in his ADHD symptoms after he switched from a desk job to a position in a start-up where his work environment was constantly changing.More From

              "2988  NikkiFor approximately half of her life, Nikki has been without a family or a home. The beautiful dog, who is estimated to be between two and three years of age, does not have one special person to devote her attention to, or a favorite, cozy bed to curl up upon.Instead, she calls the Burlington County Animal Shelter in Westampton, New Jersey, \"home.\"The non-profit organization, Friends of Burlington County Animal Shelter, is hoping that Nikki can find her special someone and finally leave the facility and start the life that she was always meant to lead. The volunteer-led group wrote:Nikki has been in a cage since 7/2013. She is good with other dogs and does well in our play groups with dogs that like to play, she is considered a HELPER dog because she gets along so well with so many other dogs. She is great with all age kids but not cats.Nikki gets so excited when visitors approach her cage that most people tend to simply pass her over...her happiness and excitment is met with rejection.The group wrote:She is a happy and loving girl who begs for a chance to be noticed and have a home. Have seen her in the play yard with a family with a 5mth old that she just laid there and let her pet her, then she got up and played ball with the 9 yr old and then had a run with the dad. She is a small girl and doesn't take up much room. She knows 'sit,' gives paw, and loves to play fetch. She really wants to please you.Please take a moment to network on Nikki's behalf; she desperately wants to love and be loved.If you are interested in meeting Nikki, or if you have questions, please

              "2992  Chinese leader Xi Jinping knows something Barack Obama doesn’t: America is finished. The U.S. economy is an ocean liner holed below the waterline. In the stateroom, the band plays on – but, on the bridge, the outcome is clear.With the arguable exception of the late-era Soviet Union, America is sinking faster than any Great Power in history.As a proportion of national output, America’s foreign debts are already larger than those of any Great Power since the rotten-to-the-core Ottoman empire a century ago. For those who need reminding, the Ottoman empire, which had flourished for more than six centuries, was then within a decade of final collapse.Because every dollar of current-account deficit (the current account is the largest and most meaningful measure of trade) represents an extra dollar that has to be funded from abroad, America’s foreign indebtedness is now accumulating at a rate of more than $1 billion a day.There is no way America can export itself back to national solvency. As Xi Jiping knows only too well, this is a matter of technology. As soon as American corporations come up with a more efficient new production technology, they ship it to China or elsewhere overseas where it will boost the productivity of foreign workers. Any corporation that wants to sell in China must not only manufacture there but bring its best technology. Then it is expected to export back to the United States. All this means that the American economy has passed the tipping point. It is now simply too hollowed out to make a recovery.  Even apparently solid U.S. manufacturers like Boeing Boeing, Caterpillar Caterpillar, and Corning Glass have long since sourced many of their most advanced components and materials from Japan, Korea, Germany, and other manufacturing-focused nations. (For a closer look at Boeing, click here and here. Much of Boeing’s most valuable technology has long since been transferred to East Asia, not least its avionics and its incomparable wing technology.)In proceeding full steam ahead towards national bankruptcy, the United States is world history’s ultimate example of the triumph of ideology over commonsense. Beginning in the Eisenhower era, succeeding Washington administrations have bet the farm on ever-freer trade. Supposedly this would strengthen American economic leadership. To say the least, the powers that be in Tokyo, Seoul, and Taipei, as well as in Bonn, Frankfurt, and West Berlin, discreetly laughed at such epochal naïveté.No nation has understood the stupidity of America’s trade policy more clearly than post-Mao China. On the one hand, American leaders have thrown the U.S. market wide open to Chinese exports. On the other, they have ignored Beijing’s in-your-face blocking of virtually all advanced American exports to China. The United  States has been by far the most serious victim of  Chinese protectionism.Barack Obama meets the Great Wall of Chinese protectionism. (Photo credit: Wikipedia)As Chinese leaders know better than anyone, the ultimate issue is American corruption. Washington is actually far more corrupt than Beijing. If you want to get something done in Washington, you do what you do in Jakarta: just slip some money to the right people. The point was made as far back as a generation ago by the prominent Japanese commentator and author Shintaro Ishihara.  From an East Asian point of view, the United States is already, in its political dynamics, a Third World country. Even South Korea, with just one-seventh of America’s population, is a bigger exporter to China than the United States. On a per-capita basis, South Korea’s China exports are eight times larger than America’s. Korea’s exports moreover consist almost entirely of leading First World goods such as highly miniaturized electronic components, whereas the main things America sells to China are Third World-ish items such as iron ore, coal, and wheat.This is not to suggest that American brands are absent from China. Actually they are everywhere. But virtually all American-brand goods sold in China are made there — using American production knowhow that, in some cases, has taken the American nation generations to build up. In an egregious sell-out of the American national interest, U.S. corporations now  almost reflexively comply with China’s  technology  demands. Unlike their peers in places like Korea, Japan, Germany, and Taiwan, they have not had much choice: whereas other nations’ governments stand behind their corporations and work hard to stem the leakage abroad of key production technologies, Washington lets the “wisdom” of the market prevail.As the New York Times has pointed out, a current example concerns Intel and Qualcomm, which have very similar technologies that China is angling to acquire. From Beijing’s point of view, it is taking candy from a baby. The two American companies can be pitted against one another in the certainty that one or other will soon cave. It is the group versus the individual and in a well-organized groupist society, the group always prevails.There is a one-way valve here. Key production technologies leak out of the United States: they don’t leak in. Other nations have industrial policies  to make sure that their most productive technologies stay at home. By contrast in a latter-day America, corporations have no national loyalty and they  have every reason to transfer their technologies abroad. That way they can aim to earn brownie points with foreign governments, not least the communist regime in Beijing. Their executives also max out their stock options.Eamonn Fingleton is the author of In Praise of Hard Industries: Why Manufacturing, Not the Information Economy, Is  the Key To Future Prosperity

              "2995  Let’s formulate the task of life extension slightly differently. Something like this…How can we extend sex appeal?Gyms and beauty salons are in charge of this question now. There is some success, but it’s mostly superficial. Plastic surgery only masks, but doesn’t delay the processes of aging.Expanding sex appeal is a complex task. Its aspects include both beauty and the activity of the brain. To be sexually attractive we have to be smart and fun. One cannot solve the problem of dementia with makeup. We have to be in an excellent physical shape to be sexually attractive, but also things should be running smoothly with our hormonal regulation.The task of extending the period of sex appeal is extremely science-intensive. It is not only the Viagra, but a complex impact on the whole organism. It is obvious that molecular biology is responsible for sex in the modern world.What do we know so far? Biological studies of various aspects of sexuality are on very different stages.In some areas, like rejuvenating skin and muscle, science is on the verge of inventing effective therapies.In other areas, like rejuvenating the brain, for example, the first fundamental discoveries have been done just very recently. I’d like to mention several “growth points” that may become key in extending sex appeal.1. Creating artificial stem cell niches for skin rejuvenation. Interestingly, stem cell niches can be used for stimulating hair growth. 2. Studying the possibility to rejuvenate muscle satellite cells to fight sarcopenia and restore muscle tone and strength. 3. Identifying the systemic factors that facilitate rejuvenation in parabiosis (that’s when two animals share their blood systems). This model demonstrated how not only the muscle, but also the nervous system could be improved. 4. Hormonal regulation, but not using the hormone replacement therapy, but rather stimulating the endocrine glands directly. 5. The impact of diet on health.I’d like to highlight a very powerful solution in improving ‪sexuality – it’s gene therapy.Right now many issues are being dealt with in this area ranging from the choice of nucleic acid intracellular delivery systems to increasing safety. However, I’m quite confident that the biological nature of human being will be radically improved and you cannot avoid using gene therapy for these applications.Rejuvenating hypothalamus and delivering ‪telomerase gene into various tissues get the most attention when we are talking about extending sexuality.I’d like to note that there will be an explosive growth in the area of rejuvenating technologies soon. Out of 200+ papers, published in the Nature Journal on the topic of rejuvenation, more than 100 date within the last 2.5 years.I am planning to write several posts about interesting research and trends in the area of extending ‪sex appeal.

              "2997  Play Even the 'Iron' Mike Tyson believes Floyd Mayweather Jr. is ducking Manny Pacquiao YouTube/BestBoxingFightNewsChannelJust yesterday, Nov. 11, 2014, trainer/coach Freddie Roach revealed that his prized fighter Manny \"PacMan\" Pacquiao is already in shape and ready to rumble anytime contrary to some observers claim that the former pound for pound king is still busy preparing for his scheduled Nov. 22 showdown against Chris Algieri in Macao, China. His revelation regarding the real condition of Manny Pacquiao was also featured on TV Patrol, one of the best news programs in the Philippines aside from a tweet of ANC or ABS-CBN News Channel that says Manny is just doing light boxing training to make sure that he will not be overworked.YouTube/enterthearenausSaid report has received mix reactions from the netizens who have been following his colorful boxing career since his “Blow By Blow” days. “Manny should continue to train hard to make sure that he will win against Algieri on Nov. 22,” said Cory Spawn, one of the Facebook users who commented on the issue. “It’s good to know that Manny is now already in shape and ready to face his opponent in the ring. I truly believe, he will demolish the unbeaten junior welterweight champ,” Garry Fazzonella said.But while the netizens were talking about the PacMan’s condition, hall of fame boxing promoter and Top Rank CEO Bob Arum was busy giving his opinion on the rumored mega fight between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao. Based on his statement, the mega fight is still impossible to happen despite other people’s claim that it will be seen at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada on May 2015 because he (Bob Arum) believes that Floyd Mayweather is not willing to face the former pound for pound king in the ring.\"How can I talk for Mayweather. I mean, as far as the Pacquiao fight is concerned with Mayweather, as much as a lot of people surrounding that would want it to happen, myself included, Manny included, Floyd Mayweather is reluctant to fight Manny Pacquiao, period. If people don't see that by now, they're never going to see,\" Bob Arum told reporters during a conference call for the scheduled Pacquiao-Algieri bout.A lot of people are expecting Floyd Mayweather to say something about the issue to clear the issue once and for all, but unfortunately, he is still undecided to share his positive opinion on the matter. On the other hand, if Floyd continues to ignore the issue, Manny Pacquiao is different; he’s telling everyone that a fight with Floyd Mayweather is one of his specific goals in life.
